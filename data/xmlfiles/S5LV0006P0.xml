<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00118"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member> rose to call attention to the present position of the Territorial Force. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I must ask your indulgence this afternoon because the various points to which I wish to call your attention are of great importance to the Territorial Force, and while I have a very large amount of matter I have found some difficulty in marshalling it, and I am afraid that my remarks will not be very interesting, and possibly not very intelligible, to your Lordships. However, my Lords, I do look upon this question as of so much importance that I have ventured to give notice to call attention to it to-day. The Secretary of State for War, in speaking on the Army Estimates in another place, pointed out that the Territorial Force has only been in existence for two years, that it must have time to grow, and that the best thing to do is to let it grow and to water and nurse it, and not to pull it up by the roots to see what progress it has made. With that view I entirely agree. My object to-night is not to pull the plant up by the roots, because, as a matter of fact, I am a portion, if only a small portion, of the root, and my sole object is to endeavour to secure that watering and nursing which we believe is absolutely essential if the Territorial Force is to flourish and grow.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00119">I want it further to be understood that I speak entirely from the civilian side of the question. I have no authority to speak, and I have no desire to speak, from the military side. What I conceive to be the duty which has been imposed on County Associations is to raise the numbers and to secure that amount of efficiency which is contemplated by the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act. The reason why I have selected the present occasion is that practically our first chapter is at an end, and we are about
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0007"/>
<col>5</col>
now to reconstitute our County Associations. It is because I desire, if possible, to produce an improvement in the relations between the County Associations and the War Office that I have selected this particular time for the remarks that I have to make.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00120">The first matter to which I would refer is the Council of Territorial Associations. That Council was formed with the approval of the Army Council. To-day we represent practically all the County Associations concerned. We are, in a way, the bovril&#x2014; the concentrated essence&#x2014;of the Territorial Force, and our Council is composed of the Presidents, the Chairmen, and the Vice-Chairmen; and the Secretaries of the County Associations are invited to attend whenever they have anything to say. I may say, at the outset, that it was a distinct understanding on the part of the Council of County Associations that whatever we asked for and whatever we were able to get was not to be diverted from the Regular Army. We fully understand that the First Line has the first claim, and that nothing must be taken from the First Line for the benefit of the second. One of our objects was to avoid perpetual questions in Parliament, and when we remember the importance of this question and the number of your Lordships e ho are members of County Associations&#x2014;125 in all, of whom fifteen are Dukes and one is a Bishop&#x2014;I think we may fairly claim, considering the small amount of Parliamentary time that has been occupied on this question, that we have been successful in that direction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00121">Our main object, of course, was to consider the various questions of difficulty that come before the Associations, and with that full authority to represent to the military side the civilian side of these questions. We have held many meetings; we have considered many questions; but the representations we have forwarded to the Army Council have been strictly limited to those that have been unanimously passed by our Council. In the original training instructions which set forth the principles to be kept in view in training the Territorial Force, special emphasis was laid on the importance of considering local peculiarities and the advantage of an elastic system of training. It may be urged that this is a question of training and has nothing to do with us,
<col>6</col>
but we claim that local peculiarities are quite as important iii the administration of the Force as in training, and we also claim that our Council have the best first-hand knowledge of local peculiarities. We claim, further, representing as we do the united opinions of the County Associations, that the recommendations we make to the Army Council ought to have full weight.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00122">The first matter with which I wish to deal is the question of numbers. A good deal of criticism is often levelled at our present shortage. When we remember that we have not yet been three years in operation, I own myself I do not think our present position with regard to numbers is unsatisfactory. The establishment, as we know, is 315,000 odd men; the actual shortage, by the Return issued to-day, is about 43,000. What I think is also a very important point for us to consider is, not merely the raising of the establishment, but whether, when that establishment is once raised, it is likely to be maintained. I issued a series of questions to the various County Associations, to which I have received fifty replies. I asked, in the first place, whether the establishment was complete; in the second place, if not complete, whether there was reasonable prospect of its soon being completed; and, in the third place, if completed, whether there was a hope that, when the novelty of the scheme had passed away, it would be maintained. Of course, we understand that the answers to the two last-named questions must be purely a matter of opinion, but they are opinions formed after two and a-half years experience, and therefore I think are of value. Boiling down the answers received, I have formed the impression that in those counties where eighty-five per cent. of the actual establishment has been already secured those Associations are hopeful of completing and maintaining their establishment; but those Associations with less than eighty-five per cent. are either doubtful or pessimistic. Here again, of course, local peculiarities come in. I do not propose for a moment to suggest that the answers I have received are exhaustive, but they do show, I think, a promising future for the Territorial Force. In sonic localities we find that particular arms are the difficulty; in others, individual units. But I ought to point out that in almost every case in which a hope of maintenance is expressed, there are
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0008"/>
<col>7</col>
certain provisos, and the provisos usually run that "if" sufficient funds are forthcoming, "if" the County Associations have a freer hand, and "if" the disabilities in bringing men to drill are removed, then they think they will be able to complete and maintain their establishment. It must be remembered that all these various matters do militate against recruiting generally.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00123">The Secretary of State for War made what 1 think was rather a serious statement the other day. He said that, owing to men continually passing out and the time it takes to fill their places, even with ideal recruiting there must be a small margin short of the establishment, and the only question was how close we could keep to it. The country believes that our establishment is 315,000 men, and it seems to me, if there is to be a margin short of that, that if we are to keep faith with the country we ought to raise our establishment in order to cover the margin. The original scheme ignores almost entirely local peculiarities. We have to raise a certain number of Divisions with the necessary complement of arms, and the quota allotted to each county is according to population. That, no doubt, was the only course possible at the inception, but now that we have had experience we have discovered that the martial instinct&#x2014;I mean the instinct that prompts men to join the Territorial Force&#x2014;does not go according to population. To complete the original scheme there has been a disbanding of existing units in localities where probably that particular arm was suitable to the particular locality, in order to raise an equivalent in another arm which may be totally unsuited. A suggestion was made the other day in the <i>National Defence Magazine</i>, which, I think, is worthy of notice. I should like to be clearly understood that I am not now expressing the view of our Council. The suggestion is that if the present establishment is made the minimum instead of the maximum, it is quite possible that large and populous districts now precluded from contributing towards the Force would be able to provide a considerable addition to the Force as a whole if they were allowed to raise the particular arm which is particularly suitable to the locality. In fact, I understand there is one county which is quite ready to raise double the number of men allotted to it.</p>
<col>8</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00124">Now, my Lords, I come back to our Council. I would like to remind you that we have, during the course of our existence, forwarded forty-three resolutions unanimously passed by that Council to the Army Council. Deputations from the Council of County Associations have been received on two occasions, and I should like to express the gratitude of our Council for that consideration. There are many minor points which we have brought forward upon which I do not wish to dwell to-night. There is the everlasting question of boots. Noble Lords may laugh, but it is not unimportant. We have induced men to join the Territorial Force on the distinct understanding that they are to be dressed like the Regular Army. They have a walking-out dress, but in the mounted corps we are not allowed to provide them with suitable boots, and to the civilian mind a walking-out dress without boots seems a little incomplete.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00125">The question of the Permanent Staff was one of the first we took up. This has been a great difficulty with many Associations. In the first place, the duty is imposed upon us of handing over a Force more efficient than the old Volunteer Force. Obviously, efficiency very largely depends on the number of Permanent. Staff we get. Yet in order to secure that efficiency the first thing done is to reduce the Permanent Staff. A resolution was passed by my Council on November 9, 1908, pointing out the special difficulties of scattered units, and especially emphasising that in order to secure good men and the class of men who were wanted, regimental pay and allowances should not be reduced on transferring to the Territorial Force. That was considered at the first deputation. A War Office Committee was appointed to consider the question, and an invitation was given to representatives of our Council to attend. That Committee met, I think, on June 30 last year, and was adjourned on July 1. As far as I know it has not met since. I should like to ask the noble Lord whether the additional instructors that were promised in answer to a question I put in this House last year are available, and what is exactly the present position of the Permanent Staff with regard to the Territorial Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00126">The next point on which I should like to say a word or two is the question of travelling to drills. This was a difficulty
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0009"/>
<col>9</col>
that was foreseen in the original training instructions. Paragraphs 14 and 15 point out that members of the Territorial Force are working hard for long hours every day, and that the only spare time they get is on Saturday afternoons and on other days after six or seven o'clock; that it is no use to ask such men to travel several miles to obtain instruction, much less to spare time to cover long distances, and that whatever instruction they are given must be brought to their doors. What County Associations have generally found is that there are no sufficient means given to them either to bring instruction to the doors of the men or to bring the men to the doors of the instruction. We entirely agree with the views laid down, and I would point out that this is a matter which has a very serious influence on recruiting. How is this difficulty met? We are told that there is no objection, if other services are adequately provided for, to the surplus being used for this purpose. We point out that if there is no surplus the difficulty will be as great as ever. We also emphasise the necessity of giving financial assistance to enable men in the non-training period to go to drill, and of providing a sufficient Permanent Staff to instruct them when they get there.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00127">Next I come to the question of weekend camps, and here I have a special little grievance in connection with my own Association. I do not forget that the noble Lord the Under Secretary of State for War on a former occasion reminded me that Staffordshire was not the only county. Since I have been chairman of the Council of Territorial Associations I have realised that fact. But I think it is important, where you have a special instance to bring forward which you consider will strengthen your case, that you should speak from first-hand knowledge. The importance of week-end camps as part of the extra training is acknowledged and encouraged by the military authorities, and a regulation scale of camp allowance is laid down. The range of one of my units has been condemned for rapid practice and another range allocated nine miles distant. The new range is difficult of access and makes practice impossible. The General Officer commanding had a special direction that more time for instructional practice on open ranges should be given. The commanding officer app lied on April 25, with the approval
<col>10</col>
of the General Officer commanding, for permission to hold two or three week-end camps at the range, the first to be held on June 25. His object was to give instruction by companies before they were called upon to fire the standard test, by which means he considered he would be able to give a more satisfactory form of instruction. No sanction was received from the War Office.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00128">There was a prolonged correspondence between the commanding officer, the General Officer commanding, the County Association, and the War Office, which I will not weary your Lordships by referring to. But finally, on June 18, the General Officer commanding wrote asking if the week-end camps were sanctioned. He received an answer stating that "No reply has been received from the War Office." On June 20 a telegram was sent by the County Association. On June 22 a reply was received from the War Office that no special grants were admissible for week-end camps, while on the same day a telegram was received from York to say that the camps were authorised. What I want to point out is the great difficulty thrown in our way. The War Office takes six weeks to consider whether sanction is to be given us, and then the commanding officer is only left two days to make the necessary arrangements. We know that transport and camp equipment are short, and the difficulty of the arrangements which a commanding officer has to make is considerable. He has, first, to warn the men. In this case there were 350 of them. What was the result? The commanding officer co Id only get tents in time by himself paying the difference between transport by passenger and goods -Lain. Many of the men only received notice on the morning of the day on which they had to attend, but their attendance was excellent. All the officers were present. There was an improvement in the markmanship, one company obtaining eighty per cent. of its full marks and another seventy-five per cent. Is it unreasonable, where you have commanding officers of units who are willing to take all this trouble and endeavour as far as they can to improve the units under their command, that we should ask that the War Office should give us reasonable time in which to make the necessary arrangements?</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00129">There is another little grievance. The question of dummy cartridges is a further
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0010"/>
<col>11</col>
example of War Office methods. It is laid down in a syllabus on the training of recruits in the Territorial Force that many hours are to be devoted to the subject of loading with dummy cartridges. The General Officer commanding the North Midland Division was dissatisfied with our musketry standard. He pointed out that a great deal could be done off the range by preliminary training, and directed that the syllabus should be closely followed. In this training, of course, blank or ball cartridge cannot be used, and therefore it is very important that there should be a full supply of dummy cartridges. The first indent for these cartridges, asking for 3,000, was sent by the officer commanding on December 24, 1909. I think it was sent to York, so perhaps the War Office are not responsible. There was, however, no result. A second indent was forwarded on February 16 of this year, and again no result. On April 26 and on May 30 reminders were sent, and as a result 132 instead of the 3,000 cartridges were received on July 6&#x2014;seven months after the first indent, and too late for the purpose for which they were intended as well as insufficient in quantity. Is it surprising, therefore, that the musketry returns are not better than they are?</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00130">I come to the general question of buildings. Here I would remind your Lordships of what fell from the Secretary of State for War on this subject. He first of all told us&#x2014;and we were delighted to hear it&#x2014;that it is a complete misconception to say that the War Office are held back by a stingy Treasury in providing headquarters. He went on to say that the Territorial Force was started with the idea that the nation was to pay for it. Mr. Haldane, however, said&#x2014;
<quote>"You must not expect luxuries. Thus I have turned a deaf ear to appeals to build large drill halls and provide swimming baths and recreation rooms on a large scale."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00131">That statement suggests that we have been making unreasonable demands, and I should like to ask the noble Lord the Under-Secretary this definite question, How many <i>bona fide</i> applications have been made by County Associations for swimming baths to be provided out of public funds? As regards the Council of County Associations, we have had most of these questions before us and such a thing has never been hinted. This was one of the questions, in addition to those to which I have already
<col>12</col>
referred, which I sent round to the various Associations. I asked them to state the difficulties they had experienced on seven or eight specific points, and this question with regard to buildings was one of them. Collecting the answers given, the difficulties are general though there are exceptions, and one of the great difficulties is the delay there has been in getting sanction for buildings. I know myself of one or two excellent bargains which could have been made if we had only been able to get the approval of the War Office, and which would have saved the country considerable expense that was subsequently made necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00132">Here is one case. Tenders were submitted on February 4, and I believe they complied with all the conditions. The builder whose tender has been accepted wants his contract signed, but we cannot sign it because we have no sanction, and he tells us now that he must revise his estimate. The delay presses very hardly on builders generally, because there is no certainty that the work tendered for will be accepted. In one case I understand there is inability to get work contracted for at the War Office scale of cost. Let me give another instance in Staffordshire. When we started preparing for these buildings we had, in the first place, to provide for twelve centres, and the amount for the buildings was just under &#x00A3;40,000. That may seem a large sum, but we had no indication of any sort or kind of the classes of buildings we were expected to provide. We had to provide for new arms of which we had had no experience. We imagined that the Force was to be a permanent one, and that therefore the buildings to be provided ought to be permanent, substantial, and suitable. The only guide we had was the old Volunteer drill-rooms. In the first place we had to satisfy the General with regard to the military capabilities of our respective drill-halls. We met him on several occasions and modified our views to suit him, and eventually our scheme went up with his approval. The date that had been given us to send in the scheme by was November, 1908, and by working at high pressure we were able to forward our scheme by that time. Nine out of ten of these applications were refused, mainly on the ground that the conditions had not been complied with. Will your Lordships believe that the conditions with which we had to comply were not issued until
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0011"/>
<col>13</col>
after the date that had been fixed for the scheme to go in&#x0021; We lost over that a sum of &#x00A3;354, and many other Associations have lost money in a similar way, one to the extent of &#x00A3;600. There is one thing we have been told about the territorial scheme of the Government more than another&#x2014;namely, the amount of deep thinking that took place before it was introduced. I can assure the noble Lord the Under-Secretary that a good deal of thinking has taken place since it was introduced, and where that thought has found expression in words they have been very often words hardly suitable for reproduction in your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00133">There is, as I have said, no consideration of local peculiarities. We have to provide the same class of buildings whether in town or in country. The old Volunteer officer knew perfectly well what he was about. He endeavoured to make his drill-hall and his headquarters suitable and attractive in order to encourage recruits. He found that in town districts these headquarters had to meet the competition of other institutions, and what is very obvious is that, if we are to make our drill-halls sufficiently attractive to induce recruits to join, that particular point must be taken into consideration. We have today at our Council passed a resolution with regard to buildings which will shortly come before the Army Council. We take exception to the principle adopted by the War Office of instituting a standard size for all headquarters of similar units, regardless of the locality in which they are to be erected. The surrounding buildings with which they are brought into competition, such as working-men's clubs, should determine the class of buildings to be erected, and if the headquarters which the War Office sanction fail to attract recruits, they must always remain dear as territorial buildings however economically they may have been constructed. We also call attention in our resolution to the fact that it would make for smoother working on both sides if the War Office were to place more confidence in the recommendations of the County Associations. Members of the County Associations, more particularly those who are called upon to act on territorial buildings, are often accustomed to deal with much larger operations than those concerned. They are men usually selected for that purpose, and they do resent recommendations which they put forward being
<col>14</col>
deemed excessive or extravagant by those who have little or no knowledge of the local conditions which prompted them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00134">I understand that the Secretary of State for War is willing by-and-by to meet representatives of the County Associations in order to discuss the whole question of finance. I shall not, therefore, go into that at any length. But there are one or two other matters on which questions were asked, and to which I have received replies from a good many Associations concerned. There is one County Association&#x2014;and I think I ought to make a special point of this&#x2014;who hold the opinion that on one point the War Office have not been unreasonable. I think it is only fair to say that, because it affords a green oasis in an otherwise arid desert of general dissatisfaction. Every Association that has sent an answer has expressed the opinion that the amount allowed for upkeep of ranges is totally inadequate. The butts are not included as buildings. Technically, they are not; but the upkeep of the butts is a great expense, and we find now that rapid firing is destructive to butts. On the question of horse hire during the non-training period there is also a unanimous opinion. I need only quote one case, which I think was in Buckinghamshire. The grant allowed is &#x00A3;50. By the regulations you have to give your recruits twenty days training, before they go into camp. In this particular case there were 100 mounted recruits who had to receive this training. Therefore, these 100 riders before they went into camp had to be given 2,000 rides, which at the Army rate of remuneration would only mean sixpence an hour a ride for each horse.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00135">The Secretary of State for War, speaking the other day, entreated to be allowed to do one thing at a time. I think our task is sufficiently difficult without additions, and we, too, would be glad to be allowed to do one thing at a time. We are called upon to raise voluntary aid detachments. We had a discussion over that particular point, and, as your Lordships are aware, owing to a little trouble in regard to the original proposal contained in the scheme we are now at a standstill. The view was very strongly expressed the other day that a solution of this difficulty should be found as quickly as possible. There is one other point with regard to being allowed to do one thing at a time. I refer to the question of the Veteran Reserve. <i>The</i>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0012"/>
<col>15</col>
<i>Times</i> Military Correspondent, in praising it&#x2014;and I should be the last to say a word against it&#x2014;described the chain of the Territorial Force, beginning with the Boy Scouts, going on with the Cadet Corps, then the main body of the Territorial Force, and then the Territorial Reserve. As far as the Territorial Reserve is concerned, I think, if it is properly financed, it will be a valuable adjunct to the Territorial Force itself, and may be perfectly well worked in conjunction. As to the Veteran Reserve, <i>The Times</i> Correspondent seems to think the matter a very simple one, and he singles out the Lord-Lieutenant as the proper person to be appointed president. He maps out the duties, which are to appoint committees in the various districts and chief towns in every county. He probably does not realise the enormous number of these committees. We have committees already in the various districts alt over the county, and in the course of time if this sort of thing goes on we shall exhaust all those who are willing to help us; and I press that we should be allowed to complete our Territorial Force before we are called upon to perform these extra duties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00136">I want to say a word about the County Associations themselves. I repeat that we have no desire whatever to interfere with the military side, but I ask you to consider the character of the men who compose the County Associations. They are the most representative men we can get. They have exceptional experience. Look at the work done. We have had many meetings. I suppose most of the County Associations have met something like 120 times since the commencement of their labours, and that does not anything like represent the amount of work they have done. It is not merely the meetings, but the labour of inspecting sites and of seeing how things are going on which add very greatly to the difficulties of the work which is done by the County Associations. What we are feeling to-day is that we have little or no power to act. We feel that our opinions are treated with indifference, and that much of the work that is done is useless. Is it possible in those circumstances that there can be any other feeling than one of discontent and dissatisfaction? I call attention to this fact particularly to-day because I feel that if this Force is to be a success there must he a better system of arrangement between the County Associations and the War Office. Resolutions
<col>16</col>
have already been passed in some Associations, which would probably be increased in number, expressing the views that I have put forward. And then consider who we are. We are all of us men who pay our full share of Imperial taxes, and is it likely that we should ask unnecessarily for those taxes to he increased? What we are asking for is not for ourselves but what we really honestly believe to be necessary to make your scheme a success.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00137">I would ask you for one moment to compare the difference of administration under the War Office and under other Departments. A return was issued the other day which showed that the number of extra officials who have been called into being by reason of the legislation of the present Government was over 1,150, of whom more than half were permanent, at salaries amounting to well over &#x00A3;130,000 a year. Consider for one moment what would have been the cost to the country if your territorial scheme had been run on those lines. You have been fortunate in having all this work done for nothing, and I do think there ought to be some recognition and some consideration of that fact. There is one important point in connection with the County Associations and the feeling that is gradually rising in connection with the attitude some of them take. A very large number, possibly the majority of them, are in favour of universal compulsory service, and the reason they have accepted office is that they realise that this scheme is the only official scheme before the country. Above all, they recognise that it is quite possible to extend on the foundation you have laid in any direction, and it is because I feel that there is a danger of losing that foundation that I have ventured to speak at such length this evening.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00138">In conclusion let me say this. There are two ways of raising an Army. You can raise it by compulsion or by voluntary effort; but if you decide to trust to voluntary effort you must make the conditions of service such as will attract the men to your Force, and our object has been to help you as far as we can to carry that out. Your primary object, I imagine, is the raising of a Force sufficient and efficient, and if the question was to be asked to-day whether the Territorial Army fulfilled the purpose for which it was created, I think he would be a bold man who would answer
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0013"/>
<col>17</col>
in the affirmative. At the same time we do not forget that the time has been short. But what the country wants to know is, Will the Territorial Force ever fulfil the purposes for which it was created? We want an expert who will take the trouble to find out for himself what are the real facts of the case; we want somebody who will not ignore what is good in the Force, and who will not exaggerate what is bad. But, as I say, what the country wants to know, what, I think, we all want to know, is whether we are ever likely to be worth the money that is being paid for us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00139"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to intervene for very long in this discussion, but it seems to me that the noble Earl who has just sat down has disclosed a very serious state of things with regard to the Territorial Force. I have no wish to find fault with the Territorial Army. It is a perfectly easy thing to do. I myself have been a member of the Auxiliary Forces for a great number of years, I believe ever since I first went to school. But what I wish to submit with great respect to the War Office is this. I am fortified in the opinion that even if every single thing which the noble Earl who has just sat down wanted from the War Office were to be given to him to-morrow morning, you still would riot have an Army which fulfilled the proper conditions of an Army for home defence.<lb/>
I dare say noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite will hear with the most profound equanimity that I have been obliged to resign my commission in the Yeomanry; but I have done this simply because, having so many things to do, I could not conscientiously give the time that one ought to give in order to train one's men sufficiently between the trainings to make them efficient and to know them and get the best value out of them for efficient military purposes. There are two considerations which must be kept to the front when we are talking about the Territorial Army. One is that you must have a Force which is sufficient to liberate your Expeditionary Force at the commencement of hostilities, and you have been told by General after General, and expert after expert, and officer after officer on the Norfolk Commission that you cannot get a Force of that kind in this country unless you resort to some form of compulsory training.<lb/>
<col>18</col>
We have heard a good deal about the Territorial Force in this House lately. The figures which the Duke of Bedford brought forward the other day, which were admitted by the noble Lord opposite, are very alarming indeed to anybody who studies the safety of his country. We know that the shooting test is not a very satisfactory one, and that a great many officers and a great many men have not passed it. I have the figures here, but I will not weary the House by going through them again. But what I do ask the noble Lord the Under-Secretary to consider most earnestly is the way in which you are going to horse your Territorial Cavalry at the outbreak of hostilities. I do not know whether there is any belief to be given to the theory of transmigration of souls, but if there is I certainly hope that my being in the next state will not be that of an Army remount horse, because if you are turned into an Army remount horse there will be four people riding you at the same moment when war breaks out. There is one point which I think has escaped attention lately, and that is that it is proposed, as I understand, although you have not got the number of men that you think you ought to have, to further deplete your Force by asking some of the men to signify their intention to serve abroad, if necessary; so that you propose to further draw on the already rather attenuated Territorial Force you already have for purposes for which they did not enlist in the first instance.<lb/>
But the principal point is that, on your own showing, the serious training that you are going to give to the Territorial Force is not proposed to take place until after the war breaks out. The Territorial Force has two extraordinary advantages. It has, in the first place, the very strenuous advocacy of Mr. Haldane, and I do venture to say that if Mr. Haldane had only put one quarter of the perseverance into showing the nation the advantages of universal military training which he has put into concealing the defects of the Territorial Army, we, should have had compulsory military training in this country long ago. There are two statements which he recently made which are of a dangerous and misleading character. He is reported in <i>The Times</i> of May 30 to have said at Guildford&#x2014;
<quote>"If the country decided that it would raise the Territorial Force from 300,000 to 500,000, he had not the least doubt, from what he had seen that day and on other occasions, that by providing the requisite machinery it was quite easy to accomplish this on a voluntary basis."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0014"/>
<col>19</col>
The Secretary of State says he can get 500,000 men. According to his own statement he only wants 315,000, but he has only got 280,000. I do think that for a Minister in the position of Mr. Haldane to make these statements is very misleading to those who think the defence of the country is being properly undertaken by the War Office.<lb/>
Then Mr. Haldane made a statement in the House of Commons on June 26 in which he led the House and the nation to believe that the small army of Great Britain of an expeditionary character is larger than the expeditionary armies of France and Germany put together. I really do think that when you have advocacy of the Territorial Army by a War Minister who is able to make those kind of statements it does require very searching criticism and constant questions in this House to put that to the test. The Territorial Force has another great advantage, that it gives the extremely tempting opportunity for the exercise of vicarious patriotism by the very large percentage of the population who do not belong to the Territorial Army but rely upon other people to do their duty for them. I thank your Lordships for the kind way in which you have listened to my small interpolation, and I trust that the noble Lord opposite will give his attention to the matters I have mentioned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00140"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to endorse what fell from the noble Earl who brought forward this question on the subject&#x2014;I rather wish he had dwelt a few minutes longer upon it&#x2014;of the Permanent Staff of the Territorial Army, more especially relating to those valuable men, the sergeant-instructors. It is one of the great difficulties in country battalions, especially where there are very scattered units, to provide a proper amount of instruction owing to the shortage of these valuable non-commissioned officers. It is all very well in a town where everybody is concentrated, but in the country it is quite a different thing. In country places the various companies are always scattered about. I have in mind one company that covered a district something like twenty miles from one end to the other, where it was extremely difficult to get the men properly trained.<lb/>
There was an idea at one time of reducing the number of sergeant-instructors. I hope
<col>20</col>
that if such an idea was ever entertained at the War Office it has been given up, and I strongly urge that the question of a possible increase in the number of these men should be taken into serious consideration. In fact, I go further. I would like to see the Territorial Force much more in touch with the Regulars, because they ought to be looked upon as an auxiliary force to the Regular Army much more than they are now. I should like to see battalions of the Territorial Force commanded, wherever possible, by Regular officers, perhaps those on the retired list. It is a thing that would require to be done with a great deal of elasticity and a great deal of thought and care, but I do not think it would be an impossible thing to do. There are many men who leave the Army for various reasons, perhaps being superannuated, when they are really not much past the prime of life, and full of vigour and zeal. Very often the services of these men are lost when they might be made use of, so long as the thing were done with tact and consideration.<lb/>
Then I should like to say one word about the great difficulty there is in giving facilities to men to travel to drills, more especially in the scattered districts to which I have alluded. This is a great and serious difficulty, and tells very much against the proper efficiency of the Force. It is not a question of men not having sufficient vigour or energy to go a few miles to their drill. It is that they cannot spare the time. A man might spare time to go for an hour's drill fairly often, which perhaps would take altogether two hours getting there and home and changing into his uniform and so on, but if it is going to take three or four hours the thing cannot be done. In consequence men drop out of regular attendance at drill when they would wish to qualify and make themselves efficient. This is admitted on all sides by those who thoroughly understand this question, which is much more a country one than a town one. I should like to urge upon the attention of His Majesty's Government that the sergeant-instructor question really goes to the root of the efficiency of this great and important Force.<lb/>
I would add one word with regard to annual camps. These have been started some years now, I think with very happy results. The men attend them, and they are popular. There, again, I think the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0015"/>
<col>21</col>
very short time at the disposal of the authorities is sometimes a little wasted. Rather elaborate tactical schemes are given to be worked out by officers w ho have not had the advantage of military training; they do not quite know how to do them. Problems are set in the advanced forms of soldiery, and it is rather a case of these officers being set to make bricks without straw. This difficulty might be got over if there could be appointed to the various camps while they are in training two or three Regular officers from the. nearest military dep&#x00F4;t. I am glad to hear&#x2014;I do not know whether I am correctly informed&#x2014;that in a camp which is to be held before many weeks at Newhaven, and which I shall have the honour of joining, that plan is going to be set on foot, and that two or three officers are to be attached for the purpose of giving instruction and not merely confining their services to criticism. I do not think it is a very difficult thing do, because camps do not take place always at the same time in the year. There would not be more than a day or two's work at a time, and a Regular officer detached for this purpose might easily get back to his quarters after his work is done.<lb/>
There is all the difference in the world between the instruction of semi-trained troops by an expert and an amateur, and I suggest that Regular officers of considerable experience, as I have no doubt they would be, when field days are undertaken in camp should accompany the Force&#x2014;preferably they should be mounted&#x2014;and should go with the company officers, giving instructions and hints and showing how these complicated man&#x0153;uvres which have to be worked out ought to be done. Territorial officers, who are many of them men of great ability, would profit in this way more from two, three, or six hours instruction from an expert than they would from a year of instruction by their own unaided efforts or by amateur soldiers. I do not wish to occupy your Lordships' time by any further remarks on this important question. I thought I would take the opportunity of putting forward one or two practical suggestions that have occurred to me after several years service in this Force, and I venture to hope that His Majesty's Government may take them into their favourable consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00141"><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to intrude on your attention
<col>22</col>
for a few moments, because I happen to be Chairman of a Territorial Association in the South of England&#x2014;Berks&#x2014;which has been fortunate enough to find the whole of the troops, Cavalry, Artillery, and Infantry, which we were required to find. These troops are about to receive their reward by being included in the man&#x0153;uvres of the Regular troops which take place next September, when I believe 10,000 men of the South Midland Brigade will be brigaded with 70,000 men in the South of England and will go through the whole of that time on service conditions. I cannot conceive anything more useful for the Territorial Force than such practice as that, and I think it ought to be made the reward for exertions made in the counties.<lb/>
I am sure everyone who is interested in the success of the Territorial Army, will have heard with the greatest possible pleasure, that the Secretary of State for War has been able to increase the grant to the Territorial Force by no less a sum than &#x00A3;355,000 this year. The whole increase in the Army Estimates is &#x00A3;325,000. Therefore the amount given to the Territorial Force is &#x00A3;30,000 more than the total increase in the Army Estimates. We had last year &#x00A3;2,277,000; this year it is raised to &#x00A3;2,632,000. There is another subject of congratulation, and that is that the larger part of this grant, very nearly the whole of it, is to be spent in making up those lapses, which the Duke of Bedford, in his able and interesting speech the other day, pointed out&#x2014;namely, in providing ranges which will enable all the officers and men to attend at the targets. I hear from the noble Lord the Under-Secretary that there is no less a sum than &#x00A3;200,000 being spent on providing a range at Furl-feet. Those of us who have commanded London corps know what a great difficulty the range question is. The whole of the Essex corps as well as the London corps will have access to this very large range, and that fills up an important gap.<lb/>
But that is by no means all. I think &#x00A3;35,000 is the stun at which cost the Birmingham range has been opened, and there is, in addition to that, &#x00A3;11,000 being spent in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and &#x00A3;20,000 in Lancashire, as well as a considerable sum in Northumberland. Therefore, we see that more than a quarter of a million has been devoted to finding
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0016"/>
<col>23</col>
ranges for the Territorial Force. In my own county we have no such difficulty. We have an excellent range on the Berkshire Downs and we have a smaller range at Runnymede, near the Thames, and another at Abingdon, so that we do not suffer in this respect. But there is one hiatus which I am sure my noble friend below me will have to look after very soon. There are certainly not sufficient ranges for the Artillery. Sir John French said the other day that the only chance for the Territorial Artillery would be to take the Regular ranges when they were not required. That is, of course, coming in very much second best; but it is a very difficult question, and as the Secretary of State was bound to spend a large sum on ranges for the Infantry, he has clone better in taking that first, and looking after the Artillery ranges later.<lb/>
The second very satisfactory point in the past year has been the enormous increase in the Territorial Force itself. I do not know whether noble Lords have turned to that point, but they will find that from October, 1908, to October, 1909, there has been an increase of no fewer than 72,000 men. I call that a very substantial increase in a single year. A still more satisfactory feature than that is the fact that out of the whole Territorial Force no fewer than 248,000 men attended camp for a certain time, and of that number more than two-thirds attended for the fifteen days. The figures are: 169,900 attended for fifteen days and over, and 78,326 attended for more than eight but under fifteen days. Those who know the importance of attending camp will congratulate themselves that such a large number of these men discharged this portion of their duty. My noble friend who introduced this subject to your Lordships' notice to-night himself visited the camps, and he said, in a speech which I read the other day&#x2014;
<quote>"A visit to the training camps, and experience of the energy with which the men throw themselves into the work, would remove all erroneous ideas of the training of the Force."</quote>
I think that is exceedingly satisfactory. I should like, if I may be allowed to do so, to mention the numbers that have been found in my own county. We had to find 28 officers and 989 non-commissioned officers and men of the Infantry. We have found 25 officers and every single one of the rank and file, so that recruiting has actually been stopped. In the
<col>24</col>
Yeomanry we had to find 24 officers and 422 men. We have every single one of the officers and men. We had to find 7 officers and 214 men for the Royal Horse Artillery Batter. We have found 7 officers and 206 of the rank and file. Therefore we have only got 8 short in the whole county.<lb/>
I should like to say one or two words about the Officers Training Corps, because that has shown a most remarkable vitality although it has only been two years in existence, and no doubt it will find an immense number of officers both for the Territorial Army and for the Regulars. It was in June, 1908, that the existing Volunteer and cadet corps of the Universities and public schools were converted into officers training corps, formed of the senior division which belongs to the Universities and the junior division which belongs to the schools. There are at this moment 145 of the junior contingents and sixteen of the senior. To the, senior, adjutants are appointed, and very great advantages are given to an officer who passes through, is drilled for four years, and obtains the two certificates. He then is excused the examination for promotion, and gets &#x00A3;35 for an outfit. I am glad to know that only the other day a contingent from Oxford, over 700 strong, went through fourteen days training at Aldershot under General Sir H. L. Smith-Dorrien; 100 of them were Cavalry, and they performed night attacks and the whole of the duties with the Regular troops with the greatest success. We must look to the old '? Universities for a large supply of coming officers, but I rejoice to think that there are 145 of these contingents already formed in connection with the schools of this country. There are one or two grievances which I regret the War Office have not seen fit to remove. I hope they will remove them after this debate. I can endorse every word which my noble friend who introduced this discussion said with regard to the question of travelling to drills. In agricultural districts that is a vital point. As Mr. Haldane said in his principles of training, you cannot expect a man who has very few holidays in the year, who perhaps has only a half-holiday on a Saturday, and who has been at work all the rest of the week, to change and put on his uniform and go three or four miles to do his training. You must bring the training to his door. What we want is the individual grant to the individual man
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0017"/>
<col>25</col>
There is another point which has not been touched upon which is a sore one with most Associations, and that is the question of the secretary's salary. The War Office frankly admitted that they made a mistake at the start. They put the salary at &#x00A3;50, which is about the sum you would get a clerk for. They afterwards made it up to &#x00A3;75, but even for that sum you will not get a man to do the work, and I do hope the Secretary of State will carry out the promise that he gave in the House of Commons the other night, when he undertook to consider the salaries of the secretaries with a view to their increase. There is another aspect of this question. I think this matter is one which ought to be left to the Associations themselves. Surely if we are able to manage the Territorial Force in our own county we are fit to settle the question of the salary of our secretary. I think it is a great mistake to put this in the hands of the War Office. It would be better to leave it entirely to the Associations.<lb/>
With regard to the whole Force, I should like to read to your Lordships two opinions which have lately been passed by two of the most distinguished General Officers we have amongst us. I think you will all agree that we cannot go wrong in believing what is said by General Smith-Dorrien, who is now in command of the troops at Aldershot, and by Sir John French, the Inspector-General. Speaking of the great improvement of the Territorial Force in organisation over the old Volunteers, General Sir H. L. Smith-Dorrien said&#x2014;
<quote>"Formerly a Volunteer had no notion what rite he would fulfil on war breaking out. Rut now every man who joins the Territorial Army will feel that he is part of a machine for the defence of his country, and that without him the machine cannot be perfect. He will know that he belongs to a battalion, to a brigade, to a Division, which will meet every year for training with the object of learning how best to fulfil their <i>r&#x00F4;le</i> in the general scheme of defence. He will know that there are thirteen other Divisions each with a special task in war &#x2026; each commanded and controlled in peace and war by the General Staff of the Regular Army, and with a Royal Artillery officer of the Regulars in charge of the Artillery of the Division."</quote>
General Sir John French, whose inspection report I read last week, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The result of the first inspection of a Territorial Division is in the highest degree satisfactory and encouraging. The important point to notice is the extreme keenness, the desire to make progress, and the zeal and energy displayed by all ranks."</quote>
<col>26</col>
Again, in his observations on recruiting he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have reason to believe that both officers and men of the Territorial Army are generally of a suitable class. The strength of the units is quite satisfactory, and recruiting is proceeding briskly forward."</quote>
It is with confidence that I submit the opinion of these General Officers on the Territorial Force, and I am sure I may be allowed to commend their views to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00142"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene in this debate for a few moments, first of all with congratulations to the noble Lord the Under-Secretary on having behind him a supporter with such implicit confidence in his scheme, and, secondly, to the noble Lord himself in having got his full quota in his native county of Berkshire. In our part of the world we cannot pretend to have got so near perfection, but to raise 600 officers and 18.000 men is somewhat different from the numbers which he mentioned. It seems to me that any question dealing with the Territorial Force must be divided into two parts, both of which have been dealt with to-day, the first somewhat briefly and the second at length. The first is very important, and the second, if I may say so, is of minor importance.<lb/>
The first is whether the country is getting value for its money, and whether we have at the present moment under this scheme an efficient force for the defence of the United Kingdom. The second is whether, granted that the scheme is a success, there are not minor defects which could be altered to make it even more efficient and work even more smoothly. With regard to the first, I do not pretend to be a military expert and I do not think your Lordships as a whole would lay down that you have a right to give a military definition of what our requirements are. But there is no doubt whatever that at the present moment very grave anxiety is being felt as to whether our Force in time of war would be sufficient to repel a raid, and the reason why this anxiety exists is not far to seek. Your Lordships will remember&#x2014;it was when the Government of which I was a. member was in power&#x2014;that a few years ago the Blue Water School prevailed to such an extent that it was questionable whether a dinghy's crew could be landed on our shores. That gradually went up to 10,000,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0018"/>
<col>27</col>
and it has now gone up to 70,000 men, which I believe is the recognised figure at which a raid can be put at the present moment. Whether that figure will grow is doubtful, but the number has made such rapid progress in the past that we may expect at any rate a slight increase in the future. Therefore you have to see whether your Force, as at present constituted, is capable of resisting an invading force which Neill certainly not be less and may be greater than 70,000.<lb/>
For anybody in this House to lay down "Aye" or "Nay" would seem to me to be impossible. But the noble Lord can give us one answer, which, I think, would allay all possible anxiety. He can give us a paper signed by the whole of the Army Council to say that they consider the numbers of the Territorial Force sufficient and their training sufficient to make them efficient to resist such a raid as I have taken as being possible&#x2014;namely, 70,000. I believe if you asked them that they would probably give that assurance, but they would couple with it a rider that these Territorials should previously have six months training. It seems to me that if you couple that rider you absolutely nullify your answer, and you satisfy the country, not as to your power to resist, but as to your powerlessness to resist any such invasion. Do you for one moment entertain the idea that any foreign country thinking of raiding our shores is going to give this six months notice that they intend to do so in order that you may make your troops efficient to meet them? I remember very well that just before the South African war when the Government of the day brought 10,000 troops&#x2014;which, incidentally, saved the situation&#x2014;from India, into Natal, the whole of the then Opposition was up in arms, saying that what the Government had done was provocative of war, and that the mere fact of introducing those troops was a justification for the Boers commencing the war. Do you not think the same thing would apply, and that if you embodied the whole of your Territorial Force avowedly for six months training to resist invasion any foreign nation thinking of making an invasion would look upon that as provocative and would refuse to give you the six months respite? Therefore I ask whether you will get from the Army Council an assurance to this House and to the country at large that they are satisfied
<col>28</col>
that at the present moment, without the six months training, the Force is sufficient and efficient for the needs of the country. That is a question that only military experts can answer, and I leave it in the hope that the noble Lord will see his way to grant my request.<lb/>
Now with regard to the scheme generally. I am bound to say that, having cordially supported it and approved of it from the beginning, I equally approve and support it as a scheme at the present moment. I am perfectly certain of one thing, that whatever means you may employ to fill the ranks, whether voluntary or compulsory, the scheme as a scheme will hold the field, and that it will be on that organisation that you will have to apply your compulsory powers if you bring in at any time national service. I agree so cordially with much of what the noble Earl stated in introducing this subject that I hope he will pardon me for one difference of opinion. The noble Earl would wish to see troops springing up in all direction as the localities may require. With that I entirely disagree. I believe it was the failing of the old Volunteers that units sprang up in all directions without any consideration whatever to their organisation as a whole, and I do think that the present scheme has given us an enormous advantage in that it has asked certain localities to provide troops and has organised these troops in regular Brigades and Divisions. I hope that in no circumstances will my noble friend think of departing from the course now adopted.<lb/>
With regard to our numbers, personally I have no doubt whatever that in my own part of the country&#x2014;in Lancashire&#x2014;we shall be able to keep up our numbers. As far as I can see, there is no falling off in the numbers that are coming in, and certainly&#x2014;and this is undoubted&#x2014;the quality of the men is better than it used to be. But you will have to meet employers even more than you do. I recognise the great desirability of taking men away to camp at a certain time of the year and taking them as Brigades or as Divisions, but it is very difficult for many employers who want to give as many of their men a chance of entering the Territorial Army as possible to let all these men go away at once, and I think you will have to consider whether divisional training ought not to give way a great deal more to brigade train-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0019"/>
<col>29</col>
ing, and whether you will not start more camps for men to go to who can put in a fortnight at a time when their unit is not actually called out for training.<lb/>
As to the various points that the noble Earl brought forward, one cannot help feeling one thing, and that is that almost every point he mentioned requires money. I myself have asked, on behalf of our Association, for a certain amount of money, but I feel that the Territorial Force has no right to press unduly for money if that money is to come off the needs of the Regular Army. The Regular Army must come first, and if we cannot get the money we require then all we ask you to do is to make your requirements from us somewhat less.<lb/>
The inner history of Grant A, which is really where the shortcoming is, is personally interesting to myself. I went up to the War Office with the Chairman of the East Lancashire Division and Lord Esher, and we went carefully through the proposed Grant A, which had then be issued, with the noble Lord and with Mr. Haldane. We were able to take item by item, with the result that even on the requirements that the War Office themselves put down for our expenditure, we ended up with a minus quantity. It was then settled to raise the amount, and at a later date a considerable addition was made to it. I have little doubt that if that amount had been given, and none of the extra expenditures that have been put upon us had been tacked on to it, the original amount would have been at all events very nearly sufficient to have met our requirements. As it is we cannot possibly manage on the amount under Grant A that is given to us if we are to carry out all the requirements of the War Office. I am perfectly willing to justify any of the accounts of the Association of which I have the honour to be the Chairman. I am sure there is not a single penny that has been expended that has not been spent with a view of securing increased efficiency for the Force. I quite agree that if you come to picking the actual amounts to pieces you may say "Why have bands? Why have prizes for shooting? They are luxuries." But I venture to think that there is nobody in this House who knows anything whatever with regard to a territorial force who would not agree that bands and prizes for shooting are not
<col>30</col>
a luxury, but an absolute necessity if we are to keep the Force together at all.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, has put forward many points where irritation has been caused by the action of the War Office. I hope that the noble Lord the Under-Secretary will not think any of these points are put forward by way of condemnation because they are critical; they are simply meant to show the noble Lord that there are difficulties which the War Office do not seem to thoroughly appreciate. I have the honour to belong to the Advisory Committee which the Secretary of State for. War called together. We have had three meetings. I am bound to say I only attended, I think, one. At the end we arrived at no definite conclusion on any single point, except that we had put before Mr. Haldane, as he said, plenty for reflection. But the Advisory Committee that was called together, if you made more use of it, I think would be able not only to show you several places where the shoe pinches, but it would also have prevented you from issuing certain documents which you had to withdraw and which it would have been very advisable if you never had issued.<lb/>
The noble Earl quoted various causes for the irritation. Let me give one example, with regard to buildings, that happened in my own case. We were asked to give to the War Office an account of what buildings were required for our force. To do this required a great deal of work, and under ordinary circumstances a great deal of expenditure, by a surveyor, but we were lucky enough to secure the assistance of a surveyor who gave his services gratis. This is what happened. He reported on the various headquarters which were in bad condition. Tenders in a lump sum were obtained from contractors. These were forwarded to the Brigadier-General in charge of the administration and were returned with a request for tenders in detail, asking that particulars should be affixed to every item in the specification. Firms tendering were requested to do this and they did it, and their tenders in detail were again forwarded to the Brigadier-General. Most of them were returned with a request that the items should be differently grouped so that new work should be separated front repairs. Anyone who knows anything at all about buildings knows that it is almost impossible
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0020"/>
<col>31</col>
to separate work which is new from that which is old, but as far as was possible this was done, and the tenders were then apparently forwarded by the Brigadier-General with a report to the War Office, and the decision of the War Office has now come in. As a rule a lump sum has been granted, but in most cases not the amount that was asked for, but rather less. Although we have sent up in detail the full specification, we are not told in what way we have exceeded our legitimate rights, but are simply told that whereas we have asked for, we will say &#x00A3;550, we can only have &#x00A3;500. That means going to the contractor for the fourth time and saying, "How much of this work can you do for the amount the War Office allows?" I think the noble Lord will see that a great deal of this irritation might have been obviated if the War Office had treated the matter in a rather different way.<lb/>
Then there is another point, really rather a curious one, with regard to this. At the present moment, to secure our one per cent. for upkeep of buildings, as noble Lords know, we have to get a certificate from the commanding officer of the regiment to say that his buildings are in proper repair. A commanding officer we will say finds that his battalion requires the &#x00A3;550 I have already mentioned. The Association entirely agrees with him that that &#x00A3;550 is necessary. The War Office disagrees, and only gives &#x00A3;500. The commanding officer thereupon declines to sign the certificate, upon which the War Office refuses to give us the one per cent. The Association is then in this position, that the War Office declining to sanction the demand of the unit and of the Association is also in a position to deny to the Association any grant whatever for the upkeep of the building. Surely that is a position that the noble Lord, with the most fervid desire for economy, would not wish to maintain.<lb/>
With regard to railway journeys, I am bound to say, in all fairness to the War Office, that I do think they must be dealt with specially in various cases. It would never do in our part of the world, where communication is so easy by tram and where railway facilities are so great, to pay the men every time they came to drill. It would simply mean an enormous expense, and an unnecessary one. Even in Lancashire we have some country districts, and there undoubtedly we do
<col>32</col>
want some assistance in bringing the men to headquarters; but in a matter like this I would say respectfully that I do not think we ought, in pressing our claim on the War Office, to assume that the charge should be made a general one. There are many other points&#x2014;boots, for example, one that affects our financial position very much; and the money for going into camp. I always dislike giving details gathered from one's old associations, but it is the only way sometimes of showing one's point. There is no doubt that for the efficiency of a Division it is better to send it all into camp on some really good camping ground. On the other hand, if we do that in Lancashire we do it at a loss. We can send the men to the Isle of Man where there is no real ground for man&#x0153;uvring purposes and make a handsome profit, because we are able to send them by sea which is a much cheaper mode of transport. Surely the War Office ought in such cases as this to pay us, not a fixed sum down, but the actual amount out of pocket that is shown by the railway warrants. There cannot be any question then of the Association attempting to make money out of the War Office, and at the same time it would prevent a lot of the heart burning that there is at the present moment. Another small point is the question of equipment. In the first instance in many cases leather equipment was purchased which had no knapsacks. Now the approved type is the webbing equipment which has a knapsack, and we want to know which is the right one to have. If you have no knapsack, then you must have some means for carrying the men's clothes and goods, and a battalion going into camp with Regular troops would be undoubtedly at a great disadvantage unless they had the more modern webbing equipment.<lb/>
I do not wish to detain the House for a minute longer. I only want to ask, first; that we should get the assurance with regard to the military opinion of the Force as a whole at the present moment; and, secondly, to support my noble friend in the many small points which together make such a large grievance. I certainly shall not, and I hope this House as a whole will not, rush into a general condemnation of the scheme because of these somewhat minor points. Condemn it if you like if it is not efficient, but do not condemn it because the shoe pinches here and there. We hope after this debate that the noble
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0021"/>
<col>33</col>
Lord will be able to meet some of these grievances. We can hope, too, that we may have some assurance from the military authorities; and, if so, I have not the slightest doubt that those members of your Lordships' House who have done their best to secure the efficiency of the. Force will do the same in the future, and feel that their efforts during the past three years have not been in vain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00143"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WYNFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in adding some words of mine to this debate I do not wish to detain your Lordships more than a few moments. What I wish to say is in particular reference to the prospects of the Territorial Horse and Field Artillery, of which subject I may claim to have a little knowledge. Two years ago I endeavoured to show your Lordships the weak points in the scheme of His Majesty's Government with regard to the training of, firstly, the officers, and, secondly, the specialists. By the latter I mean that large percentage of noncommissioned officers and men who have to be trained in particular duties and require far more technical instruction than the average Yeomen or Territorial Infantryman. I do not intend to go into the question of the supply of horses on mobilisation. I know that that matter has had the attention of His Majesty's Government, not only of the Secretary of State for. War, who is more directly concerned, but also of the President of the Board of Agriculture, who by instituting a scheme for the improvement of the breeding of light horses is assisting indirectly to ameliorate conditions in the future.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I am of opinion that during peace time some horses are required to be found for the Territorial batteries. When the Territorial batteries were first launched, I think the Wiltshire battery instituted a scheme, and funds were found to provide a few horses on which the drivers and non-commissioned officers were enabled to learn driving and riding. It was at once realised that one of the chief difficulties to be overcome would be the training of the drivers. Every County Association, of course, realised this, and believe various schemes have been instituted in different counties to provide for the difficulty. But the Army Council have not realised the importance of this matter, and have not assisted the County Association sufficiently. What happens

now? In the great majority of cases when a Territorial battery goes out to camp for its annual training, a great deal of its time is wasted in what is known to Artillery officers as driving drill. Instead of being able to launch at once into mounted drills and man&#x0153;uvres, the battery is obliged to carry out this driving drill to enable it to move at all. County Associations at present have great difficulty in finding funds to provide for horses, and some steps should be taken to assist them. The drivers themselves are ready and anxious to give up their spare time to make themselves efficient, and until they are efficient and you give them these facilities for making themselves so, only those batteries who are fortunate enough to enlist the services of old Artillery drivers will be able, so far as their mobility is concerned, to render themselves efficient on the conclusion of those short six months of mobilisation when they are supposed to be ready to meet a foreign foe.<lb/>
Let me turn for a moment to the training of a gunner. As I think I told your Lordships on a previous occasion, more than fifty per cent. of the men in a battery are required to be trained in particular duties, and few if any of these men two years ago had ever seen the instruments the detail and handling of which they had to master. Let me make a comparison. As a Yeomanry officer I know how difficult it is to train a man in signalling and other special duties. Yet 'most recruit Yeomen when they join are partially trained to their work to this extent that they are nearly all, in fact all of them, capable riders. In a Regular Horse and Field Artillery battery every non-commissioned officer is a capable instructor; yet in these Territorial batteries, not only every gunner, but every non-commissioned officer also, requires instruction, and there are only two Permanent Staff sergeants capable of imparting the necessary instruction to the 140 non-commissioned officers and men of the battery. I would ask your Lordships to notice a further point. The pay of these permanent instructors when they are drafted from the Regular Army and join the Territorial batteries is reduced in the case of Horse Artillery from 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., and in the case of Field Artillery from 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. I think your Lordships will agree that this is hardly calculated to attract the best instructors. The Secretary of State for
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0022"/>
<col>35</col>
War in another place, in the debate on the Army Estimates, said that the reports of the Territorial Army showed that they were making marvellous progress. My Lords, under these conditions of the paucity of instructors I think the progress of these batteries may well be considered marvellous.<lb/>
Lastly I come to the officers. I hope your Lordships will not think that I wish to depreciate in the slightest degree the efforts of those gentlemen who have come forward and been engaged during the last two years in picking up all they could of a subject of which they previously had no experience whatever. I desire your Lordships to realise that those officers, who under normal conditions have been instructing the men placed under them, have had to learn just as much as the men themselves. A visit to a Territorial camp where a Territorial battery will be seen carrying out its practice will demonstrate this better than any words of mine. I have studied the Army List, and I find that out of twelve Territorial Horse batteries only one&#x2014;the Berkshire Horse Artillery battery&#x2014;is fortunate enough to be commanded by an ex-gunner officer, and this battery is particularly fortunate in having a captain who is an ex-gunner officer also. So that two out of the five officers of the battery are what I might call old hands at the game. It would be very interesting to compare the progress of this battery with others not in such a fortunate position. Of the, roughly, 150 batteries of Territorial Field Artillery, only three are commanded by retired R.A. officers. It is true there are others who have served in other branches of the Army, but these have had little or no experience of Artillery until two years ago. So far as I can discover, there are only nine retired Artillery officers serving in the whole of the Territorial Horse and Field Artillery. In the Territorial Force Regulations, 1908, it is laid down that before promotion to the rank of major, Artillery officers have to attend at a Regular practice camp for fourteen days.<lb/>
I had put a Notice on the Paper for to-day, and through the kindness of the Under-Secretary for War the answer has been given to me privately. I find from the answer that practically only one-third of the majors commanding Territorial Artillery have qualified for promotion under those regulations. Another ques-
<col>36</col>
tion I asked was whether any qualification was required or certificate of proficiency. The reply to that question is in the affirmative, but I am anxious to hear a little further from the noble Lord with regard to it. But these officers when they attend the practice camp of the Regular Artillery cannot, of course, take charge of batteries. All they can do is to observe the practice, take a few lessons and observations in firing, and, having done that, they are presumed to be fit to take command of their batteries in action and instruct the officers and men placed under them. I would ask your Lordships to compare this kind of training with what is undergone by a second-lieutenant of the Royal Artillery. He joins after two years at the Royal Military Academy, and he is put in charge of only a portion of a Regular battery, where he has the additional advantage of further instruction and advice by the senior officers. Or compare it even with the training of the major commanding one of the batteries of the Honourable Artillery Company who has risen to his position from the very lowest rank in the battery. It is curious to note that in the case of the Territorial Horse Artillery the inexperience of the commanders was apparently foreseen, for each of the Horse Artillery batteries has an adjutant attached to it apparently to dry-nurse it, though I understand on mobilisation this adjutant is removed. There are many Field batteries that are similarly situated to the Horse Artillery batteries, and that are unable to receive the personal instruction and advice of their colonels and adjutants except on very occasional visits. It is, I suppose, too much to hope that His Majesty's Government will place retired Regular Artillery officers in command of all Territorial Brigades and batteries. Had such a step been taken when they were first formed, I am confident that the War Office would have had far more favourable reports now, and I am suggesting to the noble Lord the Under-Secretary for War that even at this stage the provision of more instructors, both officers and men, would well repay the cost incurred.<lb/>
Last year some of the batteries, I think it was some of the London batteries, were subjected to treatment which is almost inconceivable. They were undergoing their annual training on Salisbury Plain. They apparently could not fire their guns
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0023"/>
<col>37</col>
there, so what happened was this. They left Salisbury Camp three batteries at a time on the evening of one day. They spent the whole of that night in the train; they arrived at Okehampton the next morning, took over horses, and, I believe, guns which were not their own, shot that day on the ranges, stayed that night in camp, shot the next day and spent that night in the train going back to Salisbury Plain, a ad then I suppose they arrived in the morning ready to go out on a field day. It was a very fine performance on their part, and they deserve the greatest credit for the patience they exhibited after having endured such inconvenience and discomfort. The whole of the practice of these batteries was carried out in a very hurried and haphazard way, and, with such disadvantages, not half the instruction was gained that should have been gained. This state of affairs will continue until more Artillery ranges are provided.<lb/>
I will not detain your Lordships longer. I have endeavoured to show how His Majesty's Government, in their efforts, I suppose, to place the cost of the Territorial Army in a more favourable light than was the case in the old order of affairs, are starving that Force of Artillery by the lack of instructors and facilities for training. I ant confident that if they had shown more anxiety over the rearing of this particular plant of theirs the results and the reports of its progress would have been far more satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00144"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to stand for more than a minute or two between you and the speech which we are expecting from the noble Lord opposite, but there are two or three points which I wish to draw attention to, and I hope he will to give a satisfactory reply to them when he rises. The first is the question of the pay and position of the adjutants and the Permanent Staff sergeants. I believe in the Army Estimates &#x00A3;22,000 extra is taken for them. It is very desirable that as soon as possible an announcement should be made upon the subject, for both adjutants and the Permanent Staff sergeants complain that they are in a worse position with the Territorials than they are with their own regiments; and things have gone so far that I know in some cases, at any rate, the Permanent Staff sergeants had to be ordered away from their Regular battalions to take
<col>38</col>
duty with the Territorials instead of being willing to volunteer for it. Considering how very much depends on these men, it is most undesirable that they should think they have any grievances, and still more undesirable that they should be compelled to take on a duty which is in any way distasteful to them.<lb/>
The other point to which I wish to call attention is with regard to an allowance for travelling to drills. I think the noble Earl, Lord Derby, was probably right in saying that it was not desirable to give an allowance to every man who came to a drill, but unless some concessions are made, and larger concessions than have been indicated hitherto by the War Office, it will be very difficult indeed for Associations in rural counties to get the numbers that are required for the establishment. In my own county we have nearly 400 parishes with a population less than 1,000. Accepting the basis of one per cent. of the population, which, roughly, is the number required for the Territorial Force throughout the country, that means we have nearly 400 parishes in which the numbers who may fairly be expected to join would not be sufficient to justify the provision of a drill station, and unless some concession is made a very large and valuable recruiting ground must of necessity be left uncultivated and unworked. I do hope that the noble Lord will be able to give us some assurance on that point, and also that the War Office will be more generous than they have been hitherto in the matter of allowances to officers for attending drills. Where you have scattered companies and scattered units, if you are to get the men trained and get the officers to know them, they must make a number of journeys for the purpose, and it is rather hard upon them that they should always be required to make the whole of these journeys at their own expense, even though the County Association, which knows the circumstances, thinks that they might fairly receive some part, at any rate, of the expenses which they incur. The besetting sin of the War Office, if I may say so, all through their communications with the County Associations has been the same as that of the Home Office, the Local Government Board, and other Government Departments in London. They all think that everybody lives within half an hour of a country town, and that arrangements suitable for London or Lancashire apply equally
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0024"/>
<col>39</col>
well in Devonshire or any other county in which nineteen-twentieths of the population live in villages more or less remote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00145"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to call attention, very briefly, to one or two points that have arisen in the course of this debate. I think all of us owe gratitude to Lord Wynford, who speaks with considerable actual experience of Artillery work, for the speech he has made to-night. Very few of you who believe at all in the possibility of Territorial Artillery will go away with the idea that this is, or ever will be, an effective Force when you consider that only nine of the officers in the batteries have had any experience in the Regular Artillery, and that a third of those officers who command the batteries are in no way qualified by passing the qualification test. And a very low qualification test it is when you consider that these men, if they are going to be used in any way at all, will have only fifteen days training a. year as opposed to the 365 days training of the men they are going to meet; or, in two years, thirty days training against 730. My Lords, our Territorial Force may be wonderful. They may work hard; they may strive to do their best; but how is it possible to imagine that these men with raw horses, men who must be drawn from the towns, because it is a fact that almost the whole of the Artillery batteries are drawn from the towns and are therefore composed of men who have to learn their gun drill and their man&#x0153;uvre work and the whole of the various kinds of work which Artillery have to do, signalling, range finding, and the thousand and one other technical details which a man cannot know in civilian life&#x2014;how can you imagine that this body can be anything else but a fraud and a sham?<lb/>
I wish to join with Lord Wynford in saying that we have to give the highest praise to those individuals who are trying to undertake the duty, but with the result that they can never arrive at anything which is in any sense practical. I am sure, after listening to what has been said to-night, most of you, even those who take the most open-minded view, must agree with that. I would ask your Lordships whether any soldier believes in the Territorial Artillery. I should very much doubt if even Mr. Haldane believes in it himself, because when he went to the only review on a large scale he ever attended he had to employ Regular Artillery horses, showing that he did not recognise that
<col>40</col>
partly-trained gunners and wholly untrained horses could partake in a review. A whole battalion was disorganised in order that a Secretary of State might attend a Territorial Review; and in order to make a better show he had to have recourse to the Regular Artillery, making the whole thing a sham and a discreditable pretence; so that I should doubt myself whether Mr. Haldane does not share the views of most of the members of this House, that this Artillery is not efficient and probably never can be efficient.<lb/>
Then there is one other matter. I do not think these sort of minor matters, this policy of pin-pricks and objection to work which is done by the various County Associations, matters much. If you worry the War Office sufficiently long you eventually get some sort of compromise; and if you do get that compromise the worst of it is that a great many of us feel that we are wringing it reluctantly out of the Government, and that money is being stopped off the Regular Army. I do not wish to touch on these points. I speak as a Chairman of a County Association. We have the greatest difficulty in getting money that we really require, especially money which goes towards efficiency. Still, I do not think that matters if the big point still lies open, as to whether the Territorial Force, even if we got the whole of the money, could ever be made efficient to carry out the duties that are required of them.<lb/>
Now I come to the subject of the functions of the Territorial Force. I am only going to take one point. Lord Roberts, who is not in his place to-night, I am sure would not wish this point to go by, he having interested himself in it so much in the past. I refer to the number of foreign invaders whom the Territorial Army may have to face. I do not wish to speak from the invasion point of view, because I am dealing with a much more important question&#x2014;namely, the setting free of our Expeditionary Force. We know that if the Home Defence Force is not more efficient than it is to-day we shall cease to be a world Power, because we cannot send a single man abroad. On this point Lord Derby said that the official number of possible invaders had been raised from 10,000 to 70,000. Let me point out that we started in 1906 with the dinghy theory. In May, 1906, we had raids of 10,000 mentioned, and in 1908, by Lord Roberts's action mainly, based on figures which were entirely taken
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0025"/>
<col>41</col>
from the 1907 and early 1908 period, figures which set out the situation in the North Sea at that time, we won from the Government the admission that there was a possibility of invasion by from 50,000 to 100,000 men. It is now over two years since those figures were put forward. The situation in the North Sea has altered completely in that period, and if the Territorial Army was raised with the idea of being able to repel an invasion of only 10,000 men, it is certainly much less able now to repel an invasion of 70,000, and still less able to repel an invasion which might occur as the figures stand to-clay. When we placed these facts before the Defence Committee Germany had no submarines. Now she has submarines, meaning that in time of war, as we have no naval bases in the North Sea behind which the Fleets can go, the North Sea will have to be cleared of our ships, or they will remain there at their own peril. Rosyth is not finished, Chatham is merely a dock, and there is no place where the ships can lie. Again, since these figures have been got out Germany has altered the base of her Fleet from the Baltic to the North Sea. The Reserves which come through the 1905 German Army Law now amount at certain times of the year to the full war strength of the battalions. This year Germany for the first time has in training something like 350,000 Reservists with their regiments; that is to say, instead of having to wait the necessary time to call up their Reserves, if a call to arms were necessary the German battalions may mobilise almost immediately full war strength.<lb/>
Since those figures were put forward by Lord Roberts and others in 1908 the question of the comparative values of the Fleets in the North Sea has altered considerably, and in the course of another year or two the two-Power standard which we have heard so much about may, but much more probably will, not be in existence at all. I mention these facts simply to bring out this point. The Territorial Army, of which much is a sham, which was raised for the purpose of repelling raids of 10,000 men, could not be expected on the figures of two years ago to be effective as regards 70,000. Then how much less can they be expected to fulfil their functions to-day, when the Lumbers have altered so greatly against this country, and when the political situation in the North Sea is so very much more adverse to ourselves than it was in the days when the Territorial Army was first raised?<lb/>
<col>42</col>
I do not wish to bring up any other points. I cordially agree with what Lord Dartmouth said, that those who have worked, and worked, I think, hard, to give this Territorial Army a chance, feel that it is rather doubtful if they can bring that work into unison with their conscience, because matters in the Territorial Army are not going forward in the way they ought to do, and very much is left to sham and eye-wash when every endeavour ought to be in the direction of getting the Force better trained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00146"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who put this Notice on the Paper put it down in the widest form possible. I do not suggest for one moment that any noble Lord has not spoken strictly to it, I think noble Lords have, but the debate has run on two entirely separate lines, one being what I may call the general military and strategic question, and the other the administrative question. I feel that if I attempt now to cover the whole field of the debate&#x2014;that is to say, to deal with both these two separate questions&#x2014;I shall be taking up an undue amount of the time of the House, and wearying your Lordships. I would, therefore, if I may be allowed to do so, prefer at the moment to deal entirely with the administrative question raised by the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, and I hope the other noble Lords who have Questions on the Paper will understand that I do not in the least shirk answering them, and that I will take the opportunity of doing so when the two Questions on the Paper dealing specifically with the military or strategical point of view are put.<lb/>
I am very glad that the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, did bring this question forward, I think it is a very good time to do so, and undoubtedly the noble Earl is the most fitting person to bring the subject forward. He is not only President and Chairman of one of the Associations that has led the way in this movement all through, but he has also taken a particularly keen interest in the work of the Territorial Force as a whole. He is one of those distinguished people, referred to by the noble Duke the other night, who inspire with their presence in camp. As I say, he is Chairman of one of the County Associations&#x2014;bodies we look upon as having been of great assistance to us in many ways in trying to solve some of the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0026"/>
<col>43</col>
difficult questions which frequently lie before us. We are now at the end of the second year of the existence of the Force. The County Associations have had considerable experience, and although it is the second year in the existence of the Force it is practically the first year in which the strength has been anything approaching the establishment. So that it is now possible for the first time really to test the general financial provisions that have been made in the light of actual experience. I think it is a very good and fitting thing that we should do so.<lb/>
Before I come to the general financial question I would like to answer one or two points that have been raised. I am afraid I can only answer them by going deeply into detail, and I shall also have to quote to your Lordships a number of specific cases that have arisen. When I quote specific cases I propose in no instance to quote the name of the Association concerned and I am only going to quote typical cases that arise in order to explain, or, if necessary, to justify, our action. I want to say nothing which can be taken as reflecting in any adverse sense whatever upon the County Associations. I want no word to fall from me which can in any w ay embitter relations between the County Associations and the War Office. I recognise, and I am glad to have this opportunity of expressing it, the great work that has been done by the County Associations, and the great difficulties under which they have in many cases laboured. They can rest assured that the difficulties have not been on their side only. We have had great difficulties to meet too, but I hope that this debate, and this opportunity of ventilating our views on both sides, will help to clear the air and establish even better relations than have hitherto existed.<lb/>
I will deal with the points that have been raised as quickly as I possibly can. There is a question to which several noble Lords referred&#x2014;namely, that of our not allowing County Associations to purchase boots and then deal them out to the men. Properly speaking, boots were not regarded as part of the equipment in the old days of the Volunteers, and we do not consider them as part of the equipment of the Territorial Force. We urge County Associations to do what they can to get their men to wear good boots, and I think in some
<col>44</col>
cases they are doing it very successfully. We allow them to make a grant out of their funds towards helping the men to get boots, and to make contracts, and so on, in order to obtain boots cheaply. But I must say we are opposed to the proposals which have been made to us by County Associations, which, perhaps, I can best describe as proposals for instituting municipal trading by these Associations in the way of purchasing large quantities of boots and reselling them again to the men. I think anything of that sort is undesirable; but if County Associations can obtain in the way that we have suggested cheap boots, of course we are very glad to see them do so.<lb/>
Then with regard to the question of travelling to drills, which has been raised by several speakers, I do not know whether noble Lords are aware of it, but we recently did make a special grant to County Associations to enable sections of men to travel to the headquarters of their companies for the purposes of drills, and we now propose to allow County Associations to spend that money, which was calculated on an absolute return that was made by County Associations, and also any surplus funds, if they happen to have any, on the travelling of individuals to drills. This, I think, is a distinct concession which ought to go a long way, and I hope will go a long way, towards meeting the point which noble Lords have raised.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, considers we are going too fast. He said that the horse census and matters of that sort threw too much work on County Associations, and I notice that that remark called forth cheers from the other side. On the other hand many people think that we are not going fast enough, and that the thing is a sham and a farce because the whole Territorial Force is not complete at the present moment. That view was expressed somewhat decidedly by the noble Lord, Lord Lovat.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00147"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry I conveyed that meaning to the noble Lord. What I meant to convey was that any recommendations we made were not paid the slightest attention to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00148"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord said that, but at the same time he made it perfectly clear, to me at any rate, that
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0027"/>
<col>45</col>
because the Territorial Force was not in an absolute state of preparedness in every way he considered that we were not taking it seriously.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00149"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord again, but as he makes a direct reference to what I said I must point out that my remarks were directed to the training, and I should not have imagined, nor would any individual connected with the County Associations, that the County Associations had anything to do with the training of the men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00150"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: No one knows better than the noble Lord himself that these questions with regard to equipment and the provision of horses may be dealt with through the administrative authority, but their provision is really only for the purpose of training or mobilisation, and the noble Lord cannot get out of it by saying that he is only referring to training, because the two are absolutely connected. However, it is quite true that we have put these schemes forward. We have met with very strong recommendations that we should do so, and we are anxious to see the machinery for the Force generally as complete as possible.<lb/>
With regard to the question of secretaries' salaries, we have bad this matter under consideration now for a considerable time. The view expressed by Lord Haversham is one that is held by a great many people. We hope within a short time to be able to issue instructions with regard to that, and I trust they will meet with the general favour of County Associations. I would like to say that we have received from the Council of County Associations a suggested scale of secretaries' salaries, which has been of assistance to us in working the question out.<lb/>
There is also the question of the sergeant-instructors. This is by no means the first occasion on which it has been pointed out to us that they are, in the view of many people, inadequate in numbers. I would like to point out that, comparing the strength of the Volunteers with that of the Territorial Force&#x2014;for this purpose we can leave the Yeomanry out of the question altogether, because no change has been made at all with regard to the number of permanent instructors&#x2014;there are more instructors per cent. in the Territorial
<col>46</col>
Force than there were in the Volunteers. And in the infantry, again taking the establishment of the two, there are about the same number of instructors per cent. in the Territorial as there was in the Volunteer Infantry. Taking the actual strength into consideration, there is a rather smaller percentage of instructors for the Territorials than there was for the old Volunteers, but practically the balance all through is about the same.<lb/>
Then with regard to the position of the Permanent Staff. We hope to be able shortly to make what we believe will be a satisfactory announcement with regard to the <i>status</i> of the Permanent Staff. The Committee which was appointed, after one of the interviews which the Council of the County Associations had with the Secretary of State&#x2014;and on which there was a representative of the Council of the County Associations&#x2014;to deal with the extra emoluments of the Permanent Staff, has met a good many times and has now drawn up its report, and I hope that is a matter on which we shall soon be in a position to make an announcement. With regard to numbers, we have appointed 110 extra instructors since March, 1909.<lb/>
As to the question, raised by Lard Zouche, of appointing Regular officers to command Territorial units, I would like to say that we are, on the whole, opposed to doing it systematically. The argument has often been put forward, not so much in connection with the Territorial Force as with the Special Reserve. The noble Duke, the Duke of Bedford, has often expressed the opinion in this House that if you put Regular officers to command these units, you are apt to greatly discourage the officer on the non-Regular basis, who feels that, after all, he may work as hard as he likes, and do everything he can, and yet never rise to what ought to be his legitimate ambition&#x2014;namely, to command his unit; and we do attach great importance to that. I believe I am quoting accurately when I say that in the Swiss Militia a system of having their units commanded by officers from that small Permanent nucleus winch they maintain there, was tried, but the effect was discouraging on the Swiss Militia officers, and they have deliberately, after trying the experiment, abandoned it, and the results are on the whole better.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0028"/>
<col>47</col>
Then Lord Zouche raised the question of the elaborate tactical schemes which he says are set to officers in camp, and he also suggested the instruction of Territorial officers by Regular officers attached during the time they are in camp. I think that the general system of training is settling down. There is a much clearer view by the military authorities concerned as to the kind of training which ought to be given to Territorials, and I believe there is no doubt that we shall very soon have a much more careful system based on the idea that you have to teach people the rudiments before you can give them the more advanced work. That matter is occupying the attention of the General Staff, who are in consultation with the military authorities in the various Commands on that very point. With regard to having Regular officers at the elbow of Territorial officers to guide and advise them, our view is that opportunities of that sort should certainly be given, and that the kind of occasion on which they should be given is in a thing like a Staff ride. But when the Territorial officer is in camp he ought to be in command of his own men. It has been suggested, and there is a great deal to be said for the suggestion, that the whole of the Permanent Staff, and the Adjutant, should he left at home when you go to camp. We believe that the Regular officer is more useful on occasions such as Staff rides rather than when the Territorial officer is commanding his men.<lb/>
Now I come to the question which has been more fruitful of controversy, I am sorry to say, between the County Associations and the War Office than any other. Charges have been made that the War Office interferes too much in the method in which Associations administer their funds. I think that when those charges come to be examined it is found that it has been on property questions that there has been a great deal of correspondence between Associations and the War Office, and a very strict control by the War Office over the way in which Associations spend public money in this particular way. I am glad to say that we do see daylight ahead of us with regard to the whole mass of the work, because the greater part of it is undoubtedly done with and settled. There has been capital expenditure approved up to the end of last month to the amount of &#x00A3;680,000&#x2014;capital expenditure on new buildings, and so on; and there is still under consideration properties
<col>48</col>
of the value of &#x00A3;337,000, a large amount of which is for ranges. A good deal of the consideration of that is very nearly completed and sanctioned. We have also approved additional property rented or leased of an annual value of &#x00A3;21,000, and we have made special grants of &#x00A3;61,000 for dilapidations and repairs, so that a great deal has been done.<lb/>
I think the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, really hit the nail on the head with regard to the cause of all our differences on this matter when he said that local peculiarities have to be taken into consideration. He laid it down that it was desirable that there should be a different standard in the matter of buildings for the town and the country. That is a view we simply cannot accept, and for this reason. No one knows better than I do that it would be a very choice thing for the Territorial Force, and would undoubtedly stimulate recruiting and all the rest of it, if we were able to provide large and sumptuous headquarters for the units. The bigger the drill-hall and the better the property the more you attract men there. The more you can give in the way of man&#x0153;uvring area the greater the attraction would be. If you give a man&#x0153;uvring area like Salisbury Plain, there is no doubt that the Territorial Force would be more efficient than it is at the present moment. But, after all, we are bounded by what is possible, and by what we considered necessary under these conditions; and the only standard which it was possible for us to set up in this matter was the standard of strict military requirements. The whole thing was looked at from that point of view. The store accommodation was considered from the standpoint of strict military requirements. It was measured out in accordance with the amount of stores that had to he accommodated there. The drill-halls were considered from the point of view of the kind of instruction which usually is, and, in our opinion, ought to be, given in them. A very big drill-hall is, of course, a very nice thing to have, but, after all, the kind of drill done in a drill-hall is the kind which used to be very slightingly talked of by almost everybody after the South African War as "barrack square drill." Drill is only part of the training of a soldier, and twenty feet more or less space is not going to interfere with the nature of the drill you give him in the drill hall. This question has been gone into with every care, and we have given what we believe to be sufficient accommodation
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0029"/>
<col>49</col>
in order to carry out the kind of drill that ought to be given in drill halls. The same applies with regard to social accommodation. Of course, social accommodation does not come under strict military requirements but we provided it, and there we had to strike what we considered to he a fair average. I know it is nothing like the amount of social accommodation that is given in some of the richer towns, especially in the north of England, in London, and in various places of that sort, but, on the other hand, it is considerably better than the accommodation provided in the old Volunteer days. In some of the smaller country towns in a great many cases we have been told that the schedule is considered to be rather on the luxurious side, but in the bigger towns we have been told it is exceedingly poor. After all, however, I have explained the only standpoint we could adopt, and we have adopted it all through. With regard to the difficulties that have arisen, I do not think that our requirements can be considered either very difficult to carry out or very arbitrary.<lb/>
If I am not detaining your Lordships too long I would like to state the actual steps that were required to be taken in the provision of headquarters. First of all, we insist on a careful investigation as to what the unit that is requiring property consists of, and what unit, if any, used that property before, if it is a. case of adapting or taking over old property. Secondly, we try to find out whether it is possible to house the unit in any other existing property. Thirdly, if the case is made out, we obtain the aid of local surveyors to make a valuation of the property. Fourthly, if the property can be obtained at that valuation, we sanction it. Then, with regard to the erection of buildings, we expect Associations to submit plans, which, if in accordance with the schedule and not excessive in price, we sanction, or, if it is a case of bettering existing buildings, we expect Associations to submit plans to us, which we endeavour to get in as close accord with the schedule as possible. After that, when the site plans have been approved and the scheme has been carried out, we ask for a surveyor's certificate showing the value of the property and the life of the buildings, and then we approach the Public Works Loan Board for a loan. The Board communicate with the solicitors and satisfy themselves as to the title deeds, and when the works are completed our engineer officer inspects them, and the Board pay over the
<col>50</col>
final instalment. I do not think, on the whole, that we are asking too much with regard to that.<lb/>
But I must say that at every single stage of those various steps that I have enumerated we have been met with difficulties. I will take them in the order in which I gave them. We have had a good many cases of Associations asking for headquarters for a battalion when we find that it is only headquarters required for the use of a few companies. I am not charging Associations with bad faith or anything of that sort, but it is quite a common thing to say that such and such a battalion has its headquarters at a particular place, when as a matter of fact it may have three or four or five or six outlying companies. Then with regard to trying to fit in units into existing property. There, I admit, we and the County Associations have often been at variance. I will give a typical case, a kind of case that has often arisen. We have been asked to take over the existing headquarters of a unit that were once occupied by a Volunteer unit. Those headquarters, in a very large number of cases, especially in the cases of most of the bigger ones, are built on the best and largest scale, and it is no exaggeration to say that in the great majority of cases they are heavily mortgaged. We take over the headquarters and the mortgage also. There may be, and of ten is, a case where there is a considerable amount of ground round the place, far more than we allow in the schedule, and our view, when taking over the mortgage of these headquarters, is that it is not unreasonable to suggest that other headquarters should be erected on the site. We have suggested it, and that has been, I am sorry to say, the cause of a great deal of the difficulty and the delay that have occurred. It is very hard for us to justify renewing a mortgage on a property of this kind and charging public funds with a considerable annual sum in order to maintain property for a particular unit which we consider to be in excess of its actual requirements, and when we are providing elsewhere for new units at; a very much lower cost.<lb/>
Then with regard to valuations, we do not by any means find it easy to get these valuations. There is often great delay before the Associations send us a valuation. In some cases we have been given valuations by the vendor, and in one case we got a valuation and report of a wrong piece of land altogether. With regard to the difficulty of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0030"/>
<col>51</col>
obtaining property at the surveyor's valuation, there is a good deal of that, and it is sometimes due to the way in which the Association has carried on the negotiations. For instance, cases have arisen where Associations have handed our letters to the vendor. Of course that is not usually done, but where it is done it is very doubtful whether you are going to get the vendor to come down to your terms after you have laid all your cards on the table. The noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, quoted cases where by reason of delay valuable bargains have been lost. Perhaps such instances have come to his knowledge, but we are aware of exceedingly few; whereas we do know of an enormous number of cases where by holding out, in spite of the advice of an Association, we have got the vendor to come to our terms; and, taking it altogether, by insisting that we will not give more than what the valuer says is the true value of the property we have saved a great deal of money.<lb/>
As to the question of the acceptance of the schedule when plans are sent in, there is no doubt that that has been the greatest difficulty of all and the greatest cause of delay. We have had a very large number of cases sent to us. Plans have been prepared by surveyors at considerable cost and sent in to us which it has been quite impossible for us to accept, and a great deal of argument has gone on about them. The issue of the schedule was clue to the very point Lord Dartmouth pointed out. There was, quite naturally, a certain amount of lack of knowledge or experience on the part of Associations as to what they had to provide, and we tried to supply that by issuing the schedule. Since the schedule has been issued&#x2014;and it has been out for a very long time now and our position is perfectly plain with regard to it&#x2014;we have not departed from it at all. Our position is that we can only sanction schedule buildings. If any one will take the trouble to inquire into the cause of delay, it will be found to be because the Associations simply have refused to accept the schedule accommodation. I could quote to your Lordships a very large number of cases of that kind, but I do not think I need do so. One Association reproached us because we would not provide the accommodation "necessary for the defence of the country" as they expressed it. The particular bit of accommodation that we were arguing about I may tell your Lordships was a billiard room. Then there was the case of an Association that wanted a drill-hall double the size of the
<col>52</col>
I drill-hall we proposed, and they said, quite openly, that they wanted it for concerts, soirees, and lawn tennis. I could multiply instances of that kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00151"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord give us the swimming bath instance?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00152"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes, and I thank the noble Lord for reminding me about that. I must say I do not consider this particular swimming bath case a very flagrant one, because I believe there is in the quarters which were being taken over something in the shape of an old and rudimentary swimming bath, and one of the units that was going into it sent in a request that they should be allowed to take it over. I think the swimming bath was mentioned more in the sense of <i>panis et circenses</i> than anything else.<lb/>
Here is another case, and a very typical one of the kind with which we have to deal. A certain battalion changed their headquarters. We sanctioned the change, and in order to facilitate matters, because they asked us to give them a lump sum if I remember right, we told them that we would give them &#x00A3;6,000 to get the land and erect their headquarters, and we sanctioned half an acre as the amount of land they should negotiate for. Seven months later we received a proposal from them to buy five-sixths of an acre, and as it was in the town of course there was a considerable amount of money involved, but we sanctioned that on the understanding that the whole scheme should still not cost more than the original figure of &#x00A3;6,000. We heard nothing more of it for two months, and at the end of that time we received a scheme from this Association which, together with the land, which I think they had by that time purchased, was going to come to &#x00A3;8,500. There is an instance of a thing which has gone on for something like a year. We have been perfectly consistent about it throughout, and that is the kind of case which I see quoted as showing that the War Office take up an impossible attitude and cause an enormous amount of delay in providing headquarters. I am sorry to have taken up so much of your. Lordships' time with regard to this question of property, but it is, as I say, the most difficult and must troublesome question that we have had to deal with. I am sure it has been the one over which there
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0031"/>
<col>53</col>
has been the most friction with County Associations. I would only add this, that we have laid down the schedule, and we can only accept one standard for this accommodation, and that is a standard in accordance with military requirements. I wish we could provide clubs for the men, but there is no justification that can be put forward for doing that out of public funds. If clubs are desirable, I can only make one suggestion, and one that I make with great hesitation because I do not like appealing to private individuals. But I do think that as the Volunteer force was the recipient of a great deal of private money in the way of subscriptions and that sort of thing, there is no doubt that out of a great deal of that private money was found the existing social accommodation on the large scale in the case of Volunteer headquarters. This accommodation is a perfectly sound and fair thing for the expending of private money upon. We provide the military side of the accommodation, but I do not think it is an impossible thing to expect that the absolutely social side of it should be met out of private funds.<lb/>
Now I come to the general question, which has been raised in a great many forms during the debate as to the adequacy of the grants. We are only just in a position to judge of the adequacy of the grants, and even at the present moment I cannot give the conclusive results, because we have only received a certain number of the accounts of the Associations for the year 1909&#x2013;10, and have not been able to analyse them all yet. But I can give a general estimate of what the position is with regard to sixty County Associations. At the end of the year 1908&#x2013;09 the whole of the Associations carried forward surplus cash in the way of cash assets to the amount of &#x00A3;352,000, and they carried forward, as liabilities, &#x00A3;161,000. That is the whole of the Associations together. They had a sinking fund of &#x00A3;17,000. The sixty Associations whose accounts we have had in have decreased their assets by &#x00A3;57,000, and have decreased their liabilities by &#x00A3;30,000. They have owing to them for buildings at the present moment &#x00A3;2,500, and they have put to sinking fund &#x00A3;48,000; that is to say, their receipts for this last year have exceeded their expenditure by over &#x00A3;23,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00153"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Might I ask
<col>54</col>
the noble Lord whether he could tell us what, actuarially, we ought to have in reserve. I understand that the sum we ought to have actuarially in reserve is something like five times that amount.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00154"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that even actuarially it would be possible to inform the noble Lord. I will tell him why. I take the clothing grant as the simplest for the purpose of illustration. The clothing grant with regard to service dress is based on the life of the clothing being four years. If you clothe the whole of your men the first year you must set by a sinking fund against the time when, four years hence, that clothing is worn out. If you clothe only a quarter of your men each year, then you need not put by any sinking fund at all, because the annual grants will meet your expenditure. Therefore it is an extremely difficult thing to calculate what the total amount of sinking fund should be. Do I make that clear?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00155"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the noble Lord has not succeeded in making it clear to me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00156"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: What I mean is this. Take, for the sake of simplicity, the service dress. The grants are based on its lasting for four years&#x2014;that is to say, you get one quarter of the value of the whole of your service dress every year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00157"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: There are three annual grants for the four years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00158"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Those are upkeep grants. You do not get the upkeep grant in the first year. You draw the initial grant, but suppose in the case of any one Association that recruiting is normal in the sense that they are taking in about one quarter of their establishment every year, and there has been nothing like a recruiting boom and no great demand on them for clothing, then in that case they will be able to meet the whole of their clothing out of the annual grant, and there will be no need for them to put by a sum to replace the clothing at the end of four years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00159"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: These new men will require clothing at the end of four years whether they are many or few.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0032"/>
<col>55</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00160"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes, but for every one of those new men you will be drawing four grants&#x2014;that is to say, you will be drawing the equivalent of a new suit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00161"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to interrupt the noble Lord, but I should very much like by correspondence just to bring out this point, because I think he could probably make it more clear to me in a written answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00162"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes. I am sorry I have not made it more clear. The result is that whereas some Associations would have to put by a considerable amount to sinking fund, there are other Associations who, at any rate in respect of a good deal of their clothing and equipment, will need to put very little to sinking fund. Therefore you cannot arrive at any final figure with regard to the sinking fund. I think that answers the questions which the noble Lord asked me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00163"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: Does not the auditor point out in each Association what the sinking fund ought to be? If so, you could find out how much the sixty Associations ought to have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00164"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I have seen a good many of these accounts. They do not always give that information, and we do not require it. It is not one of our instructions to the Auditor. Then with regard to the County Associations' accounts, we took fifteen of them haphazard in order to make them typical illustrations. We took them from every part of the country, and worked out their accounts for the year on a profit and loss basis. I will not give the names. Here is a scattered Scottish county, with an establishment of just over 2,000 men, and 80 per cent. of its establishment; it finishes up the year with a loss for the year of just over &#x00A3;1,100. Here is a Scottish city, with an establishment of 2,800 men, and 79 per cent. of its establishment; it ends up with &#x00A3;600 to the bad. Here is another county in Scotland, a small one, and a fairly scattered one, with an establishment of 631, and its strength extremely low, only 63 per cent.; that county ends up the year with a gain of &#x00A3;1,200. Here is another, a large Scottish city, with an establishment of over 9,000, and 92 per cent. of its establishment; it finishes up the year with a gain of &#x00A3;5,500. Here is a typical Southern
<col>56</col>
English county, with an establishment of 4,600, and 96 per cent. of its establishment; it ends up with a gain of &#x00A3;220. Here is a very scattered English county, with an establishment of 2,600, and 84 per cent. of its establishment; it ends up with &#x00A3;489 to the good, besides which it has a considerable number of horses. Here is a county in the North of England, with an establishment of 5,500, and 84 per cent. of its establishment; it ends up with &#x00A3;5,000 to the good. Here is a very typical county as regards people and geography, and that kind of thing&#x2014;a Southern English county, with an establishment of 3,000, and 82 per cent. of its establishment; it ends up with &#x00A3;2,300 to the bad. The total result of those fifteen counties is that they are &#x00A3;17,000 to the good. My point about that is this, that it is impossible to draw any line. A good deal is said about scattered counties being more expensive to work than concentrated ones, but there are instances of both scattered and concentrated counties, some working out with a large profit, and some at a considerable loss.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00165"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: To what does the noble Lord attribute the difference?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00166"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: It is attributable very largely, I think, to the difference in the methods of working among County Associations. Some of them centralise a great deal, others decentralise. But it is the fact that all through the country there are counties alongside one another, some with considerable gains and sonic with considerable losses. I have one county here which is a perfect jewel. It is an industrial county in the North of England with big towns, and also with scattered units in its country districts, and it has an establishment of just under 8,000, and its strength was 91 per cent. last October. It has a total grant of &#x00A3;30,000. A certain number of horses, I believe, have been bought, and the men are thoroughly well-clothed and equipped. It has saved during the past year the sum of &#x00A3;3,000, and has a total credit of from &#x00A3;20,000 to &#x00A3;24,000. That is an Association with which I should also like to say we have had very little difficulty in the matter of property. That only goes to show that the grants are adequate. A good deal has been said about the inadequacy of the grants that have been given, but on these Association
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0033"/>
<col>57</col>
accounts as they stand all I can say is that the case is not proved. It is undoubtedly proved that certain individual Associations have outrun their grants, but on the average the case is not proved. We have discussed with one or two associations their finances, and we are perfectly prepared to do so with any Association that chooses to come to us; but I must say, speaking from what has been before us at the present moment, we must have a stronger case made out as to inadequacy of the grants we give than is made out by the accounts for this last year, so far as we have seen them. That, I think, completes the question of administration.<lb/>
I now come to the Artillery. Lord Wynford has the following Questions on the Paper&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. What percentage of the Establishment of (<i>a</i>) Major; and (<i>b</i>) Captains of Territorial Horse and Field Batteries have qualified for promotion to their present rank under Territorial Force Regulations, 1908, Appendix 6, Sub-Appendix II.</li>
<li>2. What percentage have been excused attendance from the courses laid down in Sub-Appendix II.</li>
<li>3. Whether these officers are required to obtain any certificate of proficiency on the conclusion of these courses.</li></ol>
The percentage varies a good deal in the various Commands, but I may say in answer to the first Question that the average is 30 per cent. in the case of majors, and 35 per cent. in the case of captains. The answer to the second Question is that, as far as we know, no officers have been excused from attendance at the courses laid down in Sub-Appendix II, but in some cases there has been an extension of time. The answer to the third Question is: Yes; Army Form E. 535 is used for this purpose.<lb/>
One or two questions were raised by Lord Wynford and Lord Lovat with regard to the Artillery, and I would like, if I may, to deal with them now. I quite agree that the question as to the provision of horses is extremely important, and I know that the County Associations have been taking it up. It is by no means an easy thing to settle, but very satisfactory results have been obtained by the purchase of horses for use by Associations. The results in sonic cases have been satisfactory where Associations have purchased horses and hoarded them out with private individuals, farmers and tradesmen, and so on,
<col>58</col>
and then have a right to call on them for drills and for camp. But, on the whole, the first plan has certainly succeeded very well indeed. The second plan has succeeded, though it has not been such an unqualified success. We are considering how best to assist Associations if they want to purchase horses for this purpose, and we attach great importance to the principle being extended of Associations purchasing horses and keeping them for their units, especially for the Artillery. The whole question of the pay of the Permanent Staff of the Artillery is under consideration at the present moment. I have referred to it already, and I hope we shall be able to make a satisfactory announcement with regard to it at an early date.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00167"><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble Lord say when he will be able to make that announcement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00168"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: No. I am afraid it concerns other Departments than my own, and therefore I do not like to make any forecast. It is quite true what the noble Lord, Lord Wynford, said about the firing practice that was carried out last year, and as to the units training on Salisbury Plain. There is a great inadequacy of inland Artillery ranges and the Territorial Artillery suffer by it, and when we have more ranges it will be of great advantage to them, and an improvement in their shooting is bound to result. As I think noble Lords are aware, we are at the present moment in process of acquiring a large additional area of Salisbury Plain which will practically double the range capacity, and the arrangements for the acquisition of another range are well advanced, so that we hope within a comparatively short time to have added at least two more inland Artillery ranges.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord raised the question as to the command of batteries by retired Regular officers. With due deference to his view on that point, and hearing in mind the undoubted skill that is required from a battery commander, I do think that the view I expressed in reply to the noble Lord, Lord Zouche, also applies to the Artillery, especially at the present time, when the Territorial Artillery is in its infancy. I do not mean to say that at the present moment you would not be likely to find batteries commanded by
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0034"/>
<col>59</col>
efficient retired officers in a higher state of efficiency than other batteries in the Territorial Force that are not so commanded. I do not say that if you were simply working for the highest standard in the Artillery this year or next year the best thing would not be to have Regular officers to command your batteries. But you have to take into consideration the question of how you are going to get the very best work and the very best efforts out of your Territorial Force, and I have no doubt that you would find, five or ten years hence, exactly the same state of things here as the Swiss found in their Militia, if you attempted to put Regular officers in command of your Territorial Artillery. I will not go into the question, which is one of the gravest character, as to how you would get the Artillery officers who are to command this large number of batteries. That is one of the first questions you would have to face. But in spite of everything the noble Lord says, the fact does remain that at the present moment there are in the Territorial Artillery officers who are not professional Artillerymen, men who have taken the work up comparatively recently, who are making good battery commanders, who are teaching their men to drive decently, who are able to get a creditably high standard of gun laying, who arc able to teach their men fire drill, and all the other intricacies of the work. The Artillery has attracted in a great many cases an extremely able, keen, and competent class of men, and those men realise the responsibilities which are being thrown upon them. I do not mean to say that the Territorial Artillery at the present moment does not vary. Of course, it varies. You will find some batteries much better than others. The Territorial Artillery has had to face all the difficulties to an exaggerated degree that the other arms of the Territorial Force have had to meet in the starting of a new system. But, taking them as a whole, I say with the utmost confidence that in the case of the Territorial Artillery, taking into consideration the fact that in many cases we have had to start building it up with an insufficient supply of instructors, and all the rest of it, the results already appearing in our opinion justify us in the experiment that we made with regard to it; and we have every reason to believe that as the Territorial Force goes on, as the men who are now subalterns rise through the various ranks and finally attain the command of their batteries&#x2014;
<col>60</col>
and it is not until you get that that you arrive at the normal efficiency of your Territorial Artillery&#x2014;then the results of which we have already seen some indications will be attained, and we maintain that the Territorial Artillery will be efficient for its purpose&#x2014;namely, as being the Artillery of a Second Line Army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00169"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like, in the first place, to thank the noble Lord for the kindly reference he made to me and to the Council of County Associations, but I own I am somewhat disappointed to find that a great many of the points T raised have not been answered at all, while a great many points I did not raise have been dealt with. I only rise for the purpose of saying that if the Territorial Force is to continue on a satisfactory basis there must be a better working arrangement between the County Associations and the War Office. That is a point which has been overlooked, and I had hoped to make it a principal point in my speech. I am afraid that we cannot look upon this as being a conclusive debate, and I feel certain it will be necessary to raise the question again. Putting the point in a nut-shell, the Under-Secretary of State for War said the other day, when dealing with the horse census, that all we had to do was to give the problem to the County Associations to solve. That is one of the things that we complain of. They are always giving us problems to solve, and when we have solved them they reject our solutions. If these problems are to be given to us, I think we may fairly ask that when we find a solution the solution should be adopted. As I have already said, the feeling is very strong throughout the country on the part of County Associations that much of their work is thrown away, and that it does not receive the consideration from the military authorities to which it is fully entitled.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00170"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I am extremely sorry if, through any ineptness of mine, I have left the noble Lord with a feeling that I did not meet the ease he put forward. I must say that I tried to meet him as fully as I could, and I hope he will not go away with that feeling. If either by further discussion in this House or outside it I can meet his point, I can only say, on behalf of the War Office, that we shall be very glad to try and do it.</membercontribution></p>

<ol>
<li>1. Is it the case that the standard test or part of standard test for musketry in the Territorial Army never has been and never can be fired on a thirty-yards range.</li>
<li>2. If the 1,520 officers and 21,980 noncommissioned officers and men of the Territorial Army who were absent from the annual training last year are again absent from the annual training of this year, is it proposed to retain them on the strength of their units. If it is considered desirable to dispense with their services, how is this to be effected in the case of&#x2014;firstly, officers; secondly, non-commissioned officers and men.</li></ol></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00174"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: In reply to the noble Duke I have to say that it is not possible for either recruits or trained men to fire their standard test on a 30-yards range. The test is fired on an open range. Our acceptance of the words "open range" is a full length range. The test is a distance of 100 to 500 yards, according to Tables A and B of the Territorial Force Musketry Regulations. Trained recruits who do not pass the standard may make themselves efficient by making two additional attendances
<col>62</col>
at a miniature or 30-yards range, provided they fire not less than fifty rounds of ammunition during the year. I would like to emphasise the fact, however, that they do not pass the standard test by doing that, although they do qualify for grants. That is a question which we discussed the other day. It is not taken as passing the standard test. In the case of recruits who are not considered competent to fire on an open range, or where congestion exists owing to lack of range accommodation, commanding officers may use their discretion. We permit that as a temporary expedient until the new ranges that we are providing arc established.<lb/>
It is impossible to give the noble Duke a definite answer upon the second Question. We do not propose, at any rate at present, to lay down any definite rule on the point. There were last year this number of 21,000 non-commissioned officers and men absent from the annual training, and it is quite possible that a certain number of those men may be absent again this year. Their cases, however, will have to be considered individually before we take the extreme step of discharging them from the Force. There is this disadvantage which applies to the Territorial Force arid which applied also to the Volunteers, but which did not apply&#x2014;I do not want to say anything in the least uncomplimentary&#x2014;in anything like the same degree to the old Militia, or to the present Special Reserve; that is, that you recruit from a class of men for the Territorials who, in many cases, occupy responsible positions in private life, and you have got to pay a certain price for those men's brains. The price that you pay for getting that class of intelligent person is that they are by no means so certain of being able to come out for training as men of not 'quite the same social <i>status</i>; and a thing we have at the present time to consider, and, of course, we are always watching it, is to see that these men do not allow their private engagements to interfere too much with their military work. In such a case there is only one thing to be done, and that is for the man to be got rid of, and where there is no chance of a man bringing himself up to our standard of efficiency there is power under the Act to discharge either officer or man if it is thought necessary to do so.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00232">He had a further Amendment on the Paper to insert a provision that "no person shall be subject to any such penalty for refusing to state his religious profession."</p>
<col>68</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00233">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this Amendment I do not wish to recapitulate the arguments which I made use of 'a lien this Bill was read a second time, but I move the Amendment for a double reason. In the first place, I understand that there are a certain number of members of this House who are desirous of expressing their opinion upon the question to which it refers, and in the next place I wish to give the Government an opportunity of making some intelligible and coherent statement in explanation of their attitude upon this particular point. If the Government were to adopt a straightforward and candid attitude and were to come to this House and say, "We are very sorry we cannot accommodate you with regard to this matter, but the fact is that amongst our supporters are a large number of political Nonconformists of a persecuting type who desire to disestablish the Church in Wales, and who desire also to multiply their numbers in the estimation of the public very much in the same way that Mr. Haldane multiplies the numbers of the military forces of the Crown, and therefore, strongly object to any impartial enumeration of the different denominations in this country," we who understand the position could not admire the Government attitude, but at all events we should feel a certain amount of sympathy for them in their difficult position and it would have this result, that we should be able to believe what they said. But, under the present circumstances, with the best will in the world I find it impossible to accept seriously the statements which the noble Earl the Lord' President has made use of in this House. Instead of putting forward any really serious arguments, the noble Earl advanced reasons so futile and so incoherent and so unsatisfactory that really they do not take anybody in, not even myself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00234">What do the arguments of the Government amount to? Briefly they are covered by the inquisitorial argument and the argument that this country is different from the rest of the civilised world, including Ireland. It really does require the most extraordinary hardihood&#x2014;I might almost say it requires a front of brass&#x2014;to put forward arguments of this nature. The noble Earl, in his statement on the Second Reading of the Bill, said he ventured to impress upon the House that a very large number of people in this country really believe it to be improper for the State to ask such questions. I want to know who these,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0039"/>
<col>69</col>
people are. Is anybody in this House acquainted with any person, male or female, who has any objection to stating what his or her religious belief is? Does the noble Earl know of anybody? I am convinced that there is not a single member of this House, or of the House of Commons as far as that gees, who would not infinitely sooner answer a question as to his religious belief than state what the amount of his income is, or answer other questions that are forced upon him by the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00235">But what I am asking the Government to do does not constitute anything of an inquisitorial nature, because it is purely optional. If there are the vast number of persons whose existence the noble Earl claims, all they have to do is to refuse to give the information. How can anything which is optional be inquisitorial? On the other hand, as I pointed out the other day, there are asked a certain number of not only inconvenient but possibly disagreeable questions which really enter into the arcana of the relations between the two sexes, and which a man or woman is obliged to answer under a penalty. The argument that this is a question of an inquisitorial nature is entirely destroyed by the fact that my Amendment is an optional one, and is in the same form as prevails in Ireland. Now with regard to the noble Earl's contention as to Ireland. Ireland, says the noble Earl, is different from England. As far as that goes, Scotland is different from England too, but no allowance is made for the difference of feeling which exists in Scotland. Why should Englishmen, Scotsmen, and Welshmen not be able to bear with a certain amount of equanimity the optional inquiry to which Irishmen take no objection at all?</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00236">I have always observed that for political purposes the Irish figure in speeches made by members of the Liberal Party as a romantic, emotional, impulsive, and quick-witted race, as contrasted with the heavier and more solid prosaic Englishman. Yet this sensitive and highly-strung being is called upon to face an ordeal for which the thicker-skinned Englishman or Scotsman is apparently considered to be unfitted, and the peculiar thing is that the Irishman makes no difficulty about it. He is not bound to furnish any particulars with regard to his religion&#x2014;and I may say that the idea that there are only two denominations in Ireland is a complete fallacy, for in proportion to the population there are just
<col>70</col>
as many denominations there as elsewhere&#x2014;but he makes no objection whatever; and out of the whole of Ireland there are not 700 people who object to state what their religious profession is. The curious thing is that the most sensitive organisation in the world appears to be that of the British political Nonconformist.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00237">I should not worry the Government or anybody else over this particular question were it not for a very obvious reason. Everybody knows perfectly well that the disestablishment of the Church in Wales is in the air. It is a long overdue item in, I believe, the Newcastle programme, and the Government are pledged to deal with this question as soon as they feel themselves equal to the task. The case for disestablishment in Wales rests largely upon statistics, more or less imaginary because they are drawn up by amateurs. I observed the other day that the Prime Minister, when making a statement with regard to a Bill now before the other House, said there were 12,000,000 Roman Catholics who owned allegiance to the British Crown. I do not know what authority he had for making that statement; but my attention was also called to a letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> from a gentleman whom I believe to be a pillar of Nonconformity, Sir Robert Perks. Sir Robert Perks, writing in a some what pontifical strain, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The established Church of England has long ceased to embrace within her fold a majority of the people."</quote>
I should like to know what authority there is for either of these statements. These are precisely the kind of statements upon which facts are required, and upon which facts will not be forthcoming unless you take an official and impartial census. I have no hesitation in saying that the refusal of the Government takes nobody in. Everybody knows perfectly well what it means. It is nothing but an attempt to conceal awkward facts, and, personally, I look upon it, in view of the political question involved, as taking an unfair political advantage of the situation. It is for that reason that I move the Amendment which stands in my name, and I need hardly say that if I obtain any support I am prepared to go to a Division.</p>

<col>71</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00239"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture very briefly to support the Amendment. The noble Lord has already dealt so fully and effectually with the inquisitorial argument that I do not think I need refer to that in any detail. That argument certainly seems to me to lose its force entirely when you look at the inquiries about age and about mental and bodily infirmities which the census form contains, and which seem to me much more in the nature of trying inquiries than any question about religious profession. I noticed that in the debate in another place the question of a voluntary religious census was treated as if it was very unpopular. Speaking from my experience, I do not think the taking of a census is at all an unpopular thing in Wales. A great number of amateurs have tried from time to time to take censuses and have seemed to derive great pleasure from it, and their results have afforded satisfaction to the particular bodies on whose behalf they were taken<lb/>
There is one very striking fact with regard to the supposed unpopularity of taking a religious census. I find that in regard to the last census, that of 1901, there were only 695 people in Ireland who either omitted or declined to fill in the column about religious profession. That seems to me to be a very striking fact indeed with regard to the popularity or otherwise of a religious census. Then there is, of course, the fact that in nearly all other civilised States a religious census is taken. I think I am correct in stating that it is taken in most, if not in all, our Colonies, and in the Census Report for India for 1901 perhaps the most interesting chapter of all is that upon the results of the religious census taken in that country. As to Ireland, it is often said that the religious census in Ireland was taken for the first time in 1861, but some attempt was made to take a census in 1831 in Ireland, but the enumerators were under the impression that they were to be paid in accordance with the number of people they enumerated, and the result of that census was not altogether satisfactory. But in 1861 the first official religious census was taken in Ireland, and it is impossible to study the Irish census without seeing that the taking of this type of census can be defended on utilitarian grounds. The results must be of extreme value to the religious bodies themselves&#x2014;of value in
<col>72</col>
the comparison of their work, in estimating the weak points in their work, and in distributing their forces for work.<lb/>
Again, I cannot help thinking that the results of such a census are invaluable to our legislators. For instance, the bearing of the census upon education is given in great detail in the Irish Report, and I think it would be of very great assistance to our legislators in dealing With the education problem if we had these figures before us. Wales is very often quoted in connection with the taking of a religious census. I am not at all prepared myself to base the defence of any church merely upon the counting of heads, hut, if you are going to use that argument, surely it is desirable that you should make it as accurate as it is possible to make it. I do not think it will be possible for those who are opposed to the taking of an official religious census any longer to appeal to these amateur figures, the taking of which has been very lax and in many cases very inefficient.<lb/>
I noticed that in the debate in another place one of the representatives from Wales, in referring to the statistical argument as far as Wales is concerned, said&#x2014;
<quote>"No ecclesiastic ever dared to say that Churchmen in Wales were in a majority over Nonconformity."</quote>
I do not assert, but I am prepared to prove before any competent authority that the Church in Wales is in a great majority over any single Nonconformist body in that country. Of course, if you use Nonconformity in a lax way and include everybody who is not a churchman, I am not quite sure what might be the result with regard to a census of the whole Church of England. If Nonconformity merely refers to the leading Nonconformist bodies in Wales, there is this important fact, that even they themselves do not claim half of the whole population. What the other half may be I do not know, but I think a religious census would throw valuable light upon that. To return to the general question, it seems to me that the object of a census is to give us all possible information about subjects which concern in the broadest sense the well-being of the people, and I cannot myself think of any information which is of greater interest or of more vital importance than that for which the noble Lord now asks. I have great pleasure in supporting the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

I venture to think that an Amendment of this kind, which would undoubtedly offend the feelings of a great many people, ought at any rate to be supported by proof of some really useful purpose which it is likely to serve. Let me take, in the first place, the comparison with Ireland, to which the noble Lord referred and upon which he threw so much scorn. I have very little hope of being able to satisfy him, because he told me to-day that the arguments which I put forward on a previous occasion front the parallel with Ireland were neither coherent nor intelligent. They were, he said, quite futile and thoroughly unsatisfactory, and if we were quite straightforward and believed what we said, His Majesty's Government would, said the noble Lord, put forward different arguments altogether. The noble Lord will forgive me, not having his admirable resources in the matter of adjectives, if I do not follow him in that. But may I point this out to him. I think it is a fact that points to some difference between the two countries. In England the occupier fills up the census return, but in Ireland enumerators are employed, and it is their business to fill up the returns. I have not much hope that the noble Lord will accept that as making any difference.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00244"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Nevertheless, I think it marks a difference in taking the census. It is possible for the enumerator, who is generally a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary, to get answers which will fulfil the requirements of the Government better than the occupier is likely to be able to do. Let me turn to another point in connection with Ireland which I
<col>74</col>
think has escaped the notice of the noble Lord. It is quite true, as he said, that this inquiry as to religion is made in Ireland, but it is a curious fact, although the figures are not very large, that in the case of the last census more than double the number of people refused to give the information compared with 1890. There is a growing feeling on the part of the people of Ireland against disclosing their religion. There is another point. The whole matter of this census was before the Statistical Society. They appointed a Committee to go into the whole question, but they deliberately refrained from recommending that the religion of the various individuals in this country should be asked for. A few words with regard to Wales. Wales was chiefly in the mind of the right rev. Prelate behind me when he spoke. On a previous occasion an authority to whom the right rev. Prelate, I think, will pay some regard, Lord Hugh Cecil, said in another place that&#x2014;
<quote>"A religious census was not asked for for the purpose of estimating the religious force of the various denominations in the country;"</quote>
and I venture to think that in such a matter as the disestablishment of the Church in Wales, we are, perhaps, on firmer ground if we take the opinion of the people's representatives in Parliament as being a more sure indication of opinion than the mere fact that the people state what their religious opinions may be in the census return. I would point out to the right rev. Prelate that there are a great many sincere and loyal members of the Church of England who wish to see the Church disestablished in Wales, and therefore in so far as he expects to find that everybody who returns himself as being a member of the Church of England is therefore anxious to maintain the establishment, the figures would certainly meet with a good deal of just criticism in this country. We do not see that any useful purpose would be served by including the religious profession in this census, and therefore we feel obliged to adhere to the Bill as it stands, and, if necessary, we shall ask your Lordships to divide upon the subject. Finally, I venture to think, in view of the fact that the matter was clearly before the Conservative Governments which were in office in 1890 and in 1900, when the question of the disestablishment of the Church in Wales was also in the minds of the people of this country, and the then Governments refused to include religion

among the subjects upon which information was to be asked, your Lordships would be well advised in maintaining that prohibition on the present occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00245"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. DAVID'S</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to trespass on your Lordships' indulgence, but I cannot let what the noble Earl the Lord President has just said pass without some observations. He has attempted to justify the position of His Majesty's Government in taking a religious census in Ireland and refusing to take it in Great Britain on the ground of some difference in regard to enumerators. The noble Earl will correct me if I am wrong. Surely that is an inadequate argument for declining to apply in Great Britain the principle applied in Ireland. The other day, in the discussion on the Second Reading of the Bill, the noble Earl the Lord President said&#x2014;
<quote>"The circumstances in the two countries are so far different that we trust they will be accepted as a sufficient reason for making a difference in regard to this matter."</quote>
A very eminent Statesman, a former Lord Chancellor&#x2014;Lord Cairns&#x2014;in 1870 went very thoroughly into the alleged difference between Ireland and Great Britain in this respect, and if the noble Earl will look at that noble and learned Lord's speech he will find that some argument must be sought for refusing a religious census in Great Britain other than merely to say, in a general sort of way. that there is some difference between the two countries.<lb/>
May I be permitted to point out to the noble Earl that he was not altogether correct in quoting the authority of the late Lord Salisbury in favour of the position taken up by His Majesty's Government? I think that the noble Earl said that the late Lord Salisbury had suggested certain difficulties in this matter in a speech which he delivered in your Lordships' House in 1890. I have that speech here, but I do not find any difficulties suggested. On the contrary, the late Lord Salisbury in 1870 spoke very strongly indeed in favour of a religious census, and, among other things, he said on that occasion that; he would be desirous to show clearly who was of the Church of England and who was not, and he did not shift his ground in 1890. One argument used in 1890 was that, though people in other countries do not mind being asked to what religion they belong, in England people feel a great peril in doing so, and always call themselves
<col>76</col>
members of the Church of England. The eminent Statesman quoted dwelt with scornful satire on the hollowness of that argument. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Englishmen always seem very free to express their opinions on any subject, religious or otherwise."</quote>
It is quite clear that if he reads Lord Salisbury's speech in this House in 1890 the noble Earl will find that he was led into an error by taking a particular sentence out of its context.<lb/>
I hope the noble Earl will pardon me if I say that he also put rather too high his comments upon the Report of the Departmental Committee in 1890. The noble Earl said, on the Second Reading of this Bill, that the Departmental Committee refused to recommend a religious census. I have the Report of that Committee before me. What they say is this&#x2014;
<quote>"In other countries and in our Colonies such information is obtained, and from a statistical point of view it is of value."</quote>
Therefore in the opinion of the Departmental Committee these statistics are of value in every country in the world in which they are taken. But the Committee continued&#x2014;
<quote>"Arguments, mainly of a political character, have been urged against the requirement of returns under this head, and we are not in a position to make any recommendation with regard to the matter."</quote>
This Departmental Committee was a committee of statistical experts, and, very properly, they did not think that it would be right for them to report upon questions of politics, and so they said that while admitting the value of the returns they were not in a position to make any recommendation with regard to the matter. I think in these circumstances the noble Earl is hardly justified in making any deduction from the Committee's recommendation, except that they were desirous not to trespass upon what were really matters for the Government of the day.<lb/>
I have looked up the debates on this subject on previous occasions. In 1860 Sir George Cornewall Lewis as Home Secretary proposed a religious census, and expressed the opinion that when a man was afforded full power of giving or refusing an answer to this question, it could not be contended that the inquiry came within the category of "authoritative demands." The noble Lord, in his Amendment to-day, provides that no penalty of any kind shall attach to a refusal on the part of any person to make
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0043"/>
<col>77</col>
this return. I therefore fail entirely to understand how any noble Lord who is concerned to use language with accuracy can apply the epithet "inquisitorial" to a schedule which simply gives a person an opportunity, if he so desires, of stating to which religious denomination he belongs. It was said in 1860, and has been said every decade since, that there are conscientious scruples on the part of many people to stating what their religion is. Sir George Cornewall Lewis pointed out that it was a very frequent thing for religious bodies to send petitions to Parliament and to say in those petitions that the petitioners belonged to certain denominations, that they represented a certain number of people; the fact that they represented that number of people of a particular religious persuasion was considered to carry great weight with Parliament, and Sir George Cornewall Lewis asked why they should object to insert in a census paper the description which they thus give of themselves. His question has never yet been answered.<lb/>
I thought at first that the noble Earl the Lord President was going to give way on the Second. Reading, when he said that if it could be proved that this return would serve some useful purpose the case would be different. Surely, seeing that His Majesty's Government last year introduced a Bill for Welsh disestablishment, most people would have thought that it would be useful to know how many people there were in Wales who described themselves as attached to or belonging to the Church of England. According to the noble Earl, it matters not what the people themselves think about the religious persuasion to which they belong, but what their Members of Parliament think. I am the last person in the world to speak disrespectfully of the Members of Parliament for Wales. They have many virtues, but I do not think the noble Earl will claim that they are particularly qualified to be enumerators of the people's religious persuasions. I ask why should you object to having the facts of the case stated. Why should you object to know how many people in Wales are prepared to declare themselves adherents to the Church of England?<lb/>
In introducing the Welsh Disestablishment Bill in the House of Commons the Prime Minister deliberately chose to base his case, one-third of it at least, upon religious statistics in Wales, and he was advised to select the number of Nonconformist sittings
<col>78</col>
as a cogent form of using statistics. That is, just the same as if the First Lord of the Admiralty, in reply to a challenge as to the efficiency of the manning of the Navy, were to say that he had an over-abundance of hammocks in the Admiralty stores. A Royal Commission was appointed in 1906, and in the terms of reference was the requirement that they should inquire&#x2014;
<quote>"as to the extent to which the people of Wales and Monmouthshire avail themselves of the provision made for their spiritual welfare by the churches of the various denominations."</quote>
As far as I can see, His Majesty's Government in that year were distinctly of opinion that the extent to which the people of Wales availed themselves of the spiritual provision made for them was a very important matter indeed. For the last four years that Commission has been at work, and I am bound to do the Government the justice of saying that they showed their desire to have the Commission carried out irrespective of political partisanship by appointing to the chair a most distinguished Judge. I hope the noble Earl the Leader of the House and the noble Earl the Lord President will be able to do something in this matter. It is a very unfortunate thing that four years have passed and we have not had a Report from this Commission. We have been told in the public Press that the draft Report of the Chairman has been ready for months, and that the majority of the Commission, indeed all the members of the Commission it is reported, are quite ready to sign it. It is an unfortunate fact, which may before very long become a public scandal, that in these circumstances we have to wait so long for the Report, especially as His Majesty's Government may in a lull in politics reintroduce the Bill for Welsh disestablishment. When they asked the question to what extent the people of Wales avail themselves of the religious provision made for them, what His Majesty's Government wanted to know was the number of adherents. There are no doubt figures of considerable interest and some value which we shall have in our hands, I hope, before long. But there is one figure you are not likely to get. You are not likely to get a satisfactory figure of the number of adherents in Wales. I say that from what appeared in the public Press. Committees were appointed in every county to collect information on this subject, over one of which, the committee in Anglesey, the noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, was the president&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

At any rate a variety Of meanings was attached to this term "adherents," and therefore His Majesty's Government are not likely to get from the Welsh Commission any complete and reliable Report of the extent to which the people of Wales avail themselves of the Church provision. What do His Majesty's Government now say? It does not now matter a pin to the Government to what extent the people of Wales avail themselves of the accommodation provided by the Church. Why, they actually appointed a Commission to ascertain that very fact. Unless His Majesty's Government have changed their minds I think I have answered the noble Earl's challenge to give a proof of some useful purpose that these figures would serve.<lb/>
The noble Earl used an argument last week which touched me very much. He said that the inclusion of the request for this information concerning the religious profession of the people would certainly not tend to peace between the various churches and denominations in the country. It is our duty to do all that in us lies to promote peace between the various religious bodies in the country, and it is a comfort to me to think that, except when political hurricanes sweep over the platform and the Press, the relations between Churchmen and Nonconformists in Wales are, to a much larger extent than is generally thought, those of peace. I should be very sorry to stand up to-day and support this Amendment if I thought the noble Earl the Lord President was right in saying that to take a religious census would not tend to peace. I think what does not tend to peace in this matter is the attitude of His Majesty's Government. Let them either adopt the only fair and impartial test, or refrain from using such statistics as they have as an argument, an irrelevant and feeble argument, for cutting up the historical unity of the Church of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00248"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that your Lordships can have been surprised when we found this evening that my noble friend behind me returned to the charge and insisted, in that direct and emphatic language of which he is
<col>80</col>
a master, upon a more adequate reply to the very strong case which he laid before your Lordships' House the other evening, and, if I may be pardoned for saying so, it seems to me that up to the present he has had the best of the argument. I approach the subject with an entirely open mind. I came down to the House the other night without any strong feeling one way or the other, and I suppose that if I am prejudiced at all I ought, after hearing what fell from the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite, to be prejudiced in his favour, because he apparently rested his case to a great extent on the fact that ten years ago and again twenty years ago his predecessors in office were inclined to the view which he holds this evening. I am not sure that that is an argument, although it is no doubt a telling one in debate, that always carries great conviction with it. Circumstances alter cases a good deal, and there are, at any rate, some facts to which my noble friend can point as being unchallenged and un-challengable.<lb/>
In the first place, we have the example of other countries. With, I think, the exception of France, I believe all European countries have, when taking a census, insisted upon obtaining information of this kind. In our own Colonies the same thing is done. Our Colonies used to frame their institutions upon the British model. I am not sure that in these days we do not find ourselves rather frequently turning our eyes to the great Dominions beyond the seas in the hope of obtaining a useful hint from the systems and the procedure which they have adopted. Then there is the case of India. In India, of all countries in the world, the Government would hesitate to insist upon information as to the religious belief of its subjects unless there were strong reasons for obtaining such information, and unless it could be obtained without doing violence to those from whom the information was obtained. Finally, there is within the British Isles the case of Ireland. The noble Earl was at great pains to convince us that the circumstances of Ireland were so different from the circumstances of this country that we had no right to press the Irish analogy. We are all well aware, of course, that the circumstances of Ireland differ in many respects from those of this country, but when the noble Earl got to closer quarters what was the main difference upon which he relied? He said, "In Ireland the information is asked for by an enumerator
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0045"/>
<col>81</col>
who is a police constable, whereas in this country it will be collected by the occupier who his to fill up these forms." I should have thought that an average Britisher would be rather less inclined to divulge confidential matter to a policeman who came and required him to afford the information than to a member of his own family or the head of the house which he happened to inhabit at the moment.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl delivered himself of what scented to me an amazing sentiment. He said "This information, when you have got it, serve no useful purpose." For what purpose then is it collected in European countries, in Ireland, and in India? And does the noble Earl exclude from his consideration the fact that in this country we are engaged with a number of great problems in which the political aspect of the case is inseparable from the religious aspect of it, so that you cannot deal with the one without adequate knowledge of the other? There is all our legislation that deals with the great question of education. There is all our legislation that deals with the great questions of the relations of Church and State. I believe I am right in saying that the Prime Minister not long ago, when he was discussing this subject of disestablishment in so far as it affected the principality of Wales, rested his case entirely, or to a great extent, on statistics having reference to the religion of the people of that country. Do not let us forget that in cases of this kind, if trustworthy and carefully compiled statistics are not forthcoming, people will be obliged to rely upon statistics which are untrustworthy and carelessly compiled.<lb/>
The noble Earl's other great argument was that the collection of information as to the religion of our people would offend the feelings of a great many of them, that it was an inquisitorial inquiry. I am bound to say that I think the noble Lord who introduced this Amendment was well within the mark when he suggested to the House that the time had passed for complaining of legislation upon the ground that it is inquisitorial. I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that five-sixths of our legislation in these days is inquisitorial. Every Act of Parliament, or almost every Act of Parliament, dealing with social matters, produces a fresh horde of inspectors whose business it is to be inquisitorial and to pry into the people's homes and find out everything concerning the most intimate affairs of
<col>82</col>
their daily life. We make no complaint of it. We have to submit to it. But what we have, I think, a right to complain of is that these inquisitorial proceedings should be, as they are, encouraged by His Majesty's Government, but that on this particular occasion they should block us with the argument that it would be an inquisitorial and iniquitous proceeding to demand of the people of the United Kingdom that they should state what their religion is.<lb/>
There is another, and it seems to me a complete, answer to the plea that this would be an inquisitorial proceeding. My noble friend provides by a second Amendment that no one need supply this information if he objects to supply it. Is it suggested, then, that the result of giving that option would be that a great many people would avail themselves of it and that your returns would be incomplete? I do not believe it. The Irish case which was cited to-night is, it seems to me, most instructive upon that point. I think we were told that on the occasion of the last census there were less than 700 abstentions in the whole of Ireland. The noble Earl says the number has increased. It may have doubled, but whether it is 300 or 700 the figure seems to me to be an entirely insignificant one, and to show that there is no genuine or deep-seated objection to supplying information of this kind. There was another argument which I noticed the other evening fell front the noble Lord who sits on the Back Bench opposite (Lord Sheffield). He was, unless I mistook his meaning, arguing that these returns were generally untrustworthy. He said that what would happen would be something of this kind. You would have a sturdy Nonconformist in the habit of attending chapel on Sundays, but who would get married in Church, and for whom the hospitality of the village churchyard would be claimed after his death. I gather that the noble Lord said that such a man would be very apt to return himself as a member of the Church of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00249"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I did not use the expression "sturdy" Nonconformist.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00250"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Well, the ordinary Nonconformist. I live in a part of England where there is a great deal of Nonconformity, and for all I know it may be the case that some of the Non-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0046"/>
<col>83</col>
conformist villagers get married in the village church, and possibly some of them are buried in the village churchyard. But of this I am perfectly certain, that not one of them would declare himself, when he had to fill up a paper, to be a member of the Church of England if he was a Wesleyan or a Methodist. I believe it would be absolutely foreign to his idea of what was right and honest. Let me say, finally, that it seems to me that if a man has so little belief in the religion which he professes, so little courage of his religious opinion, as to return himself as belonging to some denomination other than that of which he is really a member, you may very fairly treat him and his religions opinions as a negligible quantity for all public purposes. For these reasons I think my noble friend behind me has had the best of the argument. I do not know whether he intends to press his Amendment to a Division. I am afraid that we are powerless on this side of the House to impose an Amendment of this kind upon His Majesty's Government, because it is perfectly clear that we must have a census, and if His Majesty's Government regard this proposal as fatal to their Bill we should be very sorry to see them drop it on account of our interference. Therefore my noble friend may possibly regard discretion as the better part of valour, and be content with having had, as I believe he has, very much the best of this discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00251"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to have to intrude upon your Lordships again after last Thursday, but I will try to avoid the example which others have set and not repeat anything I said in the discussion upon the Second Reading, except so far as is absolutely necessary to explain to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition the position I took up. In the course of my life I have been brought a good deal in contact with what I may call the Nonconformist point of view, and though I am in no respect a member of any of their chinches I am familiar with their common attitude; and I would appeal to people who know the country whether there are not a large number who flow from Church to chapel and <i>vice vers&#x00E2;</i> according to the attractiveness of the services, and, may I say, the Protestantism of the established clergyman. I know that you have chapels emptied in some cases by a liberal and
<col>84</col>
broad-minded clergyman of the Church of England, and if another man is appointed the people will flow back to chapel. I am not, of course, speaking of sturdy Nonconformists.<lb/>
I pointed out last Thursday that there were also people whose religion consisted largely, like the Royal Declaration, in disclaiming the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, and I said that you would entirely falsify any statistics of genuine adherence to any form of religious profession if you included all that floating body who will call themselves members of the Church of England if they have to call themselves something, because they really do not know what they are. I am reminded of a story of the great Lord Thurlow. There came to him when he was Lord Chancellor a deputation of Dissenters to urge upon him some grievance, and Lord Thurlow replied&#x2014;
<quote>"Gentlemen, I belong to the Church of England. I belong to the Church of England because it is established. If your&#x2014;religion was established I would belong to your&#x2014;religion."</quote>
That summarises a point of view that was rather prevalent in the eighteenth century. Theological activity has made that point of view not so prominent now as then, but it still exists in the minds of a great many people. What they subscribe to is to being members of the Established Church.<lb/>
The noble Marquess has suggested that with reference to much legislation it would be important to know the religious point of view of proportions of the population. I agree with him. When important questions come up in Parliament&#x2014;such questions as under the leadership of Mr. Disraeli led to the Public Worship Bill&#x2014;this information is of value. It would be a very important thing, when dealing with ritual in the Established Church, to know whether the legislation is sympathised with by the bulk of the people who are nominally members of the Church of England. The Established Church is like that net in Scripture which enclosed a great variety of fishes, and also like that net which contained animals clean and otherwise. If, in taking the census, we could ask people to say whether they were Broad Church, High Church, or Low Church, we should get some idea of what their religious preferences were. The Church contains within
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0047"/>
<col>85</col>
itself people far more widely removed from one another in religious belief than is the average Nonconformist from the average member of the Church of England, and if we are to secure figures that are to be of any value in order to determine how we are to legislate we should have to go further and find out what they really believe. For these reasons and those I gave before, which I will not repeat, I think the figures as to religious profession would be deceitful; they would give an apparent weight to the Church of England to which it is not entitled. I understood the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of St. David's to say that I had taken the chair at a meeting for the purposes of collecting statistics connected with the Commission upon the Welsh Church. I never took the chair at any such meeting.</membercontribution></p>

I will not say they are entirely irrelevant or that they are always feeble, but when we are arguing these matters we should argue them on a better basis than that of statistics. The two right rev. Prelates, while clamouring for these figures, said that if the figures went against them they would not be bound by them. I put it to the right rev. Prelates: Will they say to the Government, "If these figures of the adherents to the Established Church and other bodies in Wales are forthcoming and they go against the Established Church and show that the Established Church is in a minority, we will join with you in disestablishing the Church"? Of course, they will not. Then what is the good of playing the game of "heads I win tails you lose." I think that is rather an injudicious attitude to take up. There are very few in this House whom I should be more unhappy to be misunderstood by than the noble Marquess opposite, and I have therefore made these few observations in order to make clear my position.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00254"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl the Lord President, in speaking on the Amendment, asked what possible use there could be in any kind of religious census, at all events at the present day. That question has been so ably answered that I am not going to detain your Lordships one minute more than is necessary. But there is one thing which has been omitted with reference to this matter. There is an important piece of legislation now in the other House of Parliament and which will soon be presented to this House for the alteration of the Accession Oath. I think it would be extremely useful to ascertain how many Roman Catholics there are in Great Britain. It is a curious thing that the number has never been really ascertained. It has only been very approximately guessed at; and, speaking as a Catholic myself, I have always heard it stated there we number 2,000.000 in Great Britain alone. Personally, I think that number is slightly overdrawn. Others go further, and say there more than 2.000,000. However that may be, it is quite certain that the exact number has not been ascertained.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord who has just sat down that it would be practically impossible to ascertain with exactitude the number of members or adherents of the Church of England in this country, for the simple reason that there are hundreds and thousands of men and women who go to the Anglican church in the morning and also for baptisms, weddings, and funerals, but who frequent a dissenting chapel in the village or large town in the evening. When such people were asked to which denomination they belonged, in nine cases out of ten they would write themselves down as members of the Church of England, but their practical religion is really Nonconformist. Therefore it would be exceedingly difficult to obtain the true figures for the Church of England. But when you come to the Catholic question it is totally different. Every Catholic all over the world knows whether he is a Catholic or not; there would be no difficulty in getting a. plain "Yes" or "No" in the case of adherents of the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore I venture to think the proposed statistics would be of considerable value in this country, especially in view of the proposed alteration in the Royal Declaration.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00255"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as it was impossible for me to be in the House on Thursday last when this subject was preliminarily discussed, I should like to say a few words upon the point raised by this Amendment. I am sorry that His Majesty's Government have refused what I am bound to say seems to me a perfectly reasonable request&#x2014;a request which goes no further than this, that any man who desires to do so when the census returns are made should have an opportunity of stating to what religious denomination he belongs. Such a Return, Lord Sheffield says, would tell in debate hereafter to the disadvantage of a. cause which he has long advocated, and we are there, I suppose, to learn the reason why a request which otherwise would seem so reasonable is to be refused.<lb/>
Some of the arguments dwelt upon by the noble Earl the Lord President of the Council in his speech surprised me. I cannot see what it has to do with the matter that years ago the people of Ireland were so illiterate that it had been necessary to make the enumerators fill up the return. What that has to do with the fact that we want to get this return to-day I am totally unable to conjecture. Would the Government be prepared to accept the Amendment if it stated that the return must be filled up by the enumerator? Then we are told that people dislike giving this information. That is to say, they dislike being offered an opportunity that they need not accept unless they choose of filling up a particular form in a way which would indicate certain facts respecting them.<lb/>
The question of Welsh Disestablishment has loomed rather needlessly large in this question. The difficulty and obscurity of that controversy is not the ground on which I mainly desire to see this Amendment carried through. I am by no means prepared to say that such statistics, after proper discount has been made on both sides, would be without value when that controversy comes up. But it is on other grounds that I personally would desire to see the additional column which is suggested by this Amendment. I do not know whether I beard the noble Earl correctly, but I gathered that he said we must not rely, in a matter of Parliamentary controversy, upon the religious opinions of the electors
<col>88</col>
but rather examine what are the religious opinions of those whom they choose as representatives. Have we really conic to this, that a Liberal Government say that the main factor in selecting a Member of Parliament is his religious opinions? That is not the doctrine of Liberalism in which I was reared, and I fear that it would be a very misleading form of criterion.<lb/>
We are told that these statistics would be of no value. I do not grant it, but, If I did, I should still value these statistics. It is true that a purely Parliamentary controversy, though Disestablishment is more than that, could not wholly be decided either in England or Wales on the mere statistical question, but I should still maintain that obtaining and tabulating these facts would be of very real value if they were used with common sense and with large discounts on each side. It is perfectly true that there would be a great many people who would return themselves as Churchmen who are not Churchmen worthy of the name. It is also true, I am quite certain, that there would be a great many of these Nonconformists whom we are warned not to call "sturdy," who as heads of the households would fill up the return by a statement that the family were all Nonconformists, while it might be perfectly true that a good many members of the family were, to ssy the least, very lukewarm in their Nonconformity. Therefore I should wish to discount these statistics; but I still maintain that, after discounts had been made, such a return would serve a very useful purpose.<lb/>
There are a large number of people in the country who are indifferent, careless, non-religious if you will, as regards any outward exhibition of religious devotion by attending at a place of worship, or in any other similar way, but every one of us who has had to do with parish work in England knows that these people are daily asking for ministration or counsel or help on the part of the clergy quite apart from the mere question of religious teaching. But from those who claim that kind of ministration on the part of the Church there must be deducted those who definitely claim religious ministration in other quarters, and we should know in a particular town or district or county or great area what number
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0049"/>
<col>89</col>
of people there were who might be distinctly regarded as those who do not want and do not use the ministrations of the Church as such. But when that deduction has been made, there will remain a huge number of persons who, as a matter of fact, while not returning themselves necessarily as members of the Church of England, will not return themselves as members of other denominations, and who, when they do not return themselves as belonging to other denominations, are practically left to such help, such counsel, and such guidance as in great crowded places is given daily by the clergy of the Church of England.<lb/>
It was my privilege to work for some years in the Bishopric of Rochester, which included the whole of South London, and. there the proportion was something like ten or twelve resident clergy for one resident Nonconformist minister. These resident clergy are men who are working day in and day out, and what we want to know is what number of people there are in a neighbourhood who because they are firmly attached to other denominations do not want the kind of help, secular as well as sacred, which is given by the clergy. Those sort of statistics would be of the greatest possible value, not perhaps to the nation, but to the religious bodies themselves, whether Church or Nonconformist. Therefore I urge the expediency of accepting the Amendment, not because of its value to the nation or its Blue-book statistics, but for its value to the religious work of the country both Church and Nonconformist. I think great help would be derived from the possession of such figures, and it does seem to me strange that so reasonable a request should be declined.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00256"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition began by dealing with an argument used by my noble friend the Lord President as to the action of previous Governments in reference to this question, and he said that the argument was not a strong one because the mere fact that a thing was not done ten years ago was no reason for not doing it now. But, on the other hand, when you are asked to change a practice which has uniformly obtained, you may reasonably ask that strong reasons
<col>90</col>
should be brought forward for doing so; and I think we must assume that on the last two occasions, in 1890 and 1900, a strong opinion was held on both sides of the House that this particular change was not desirable. The right rev. Prelate the Bishop of St. David's quoted the late Lord Salisbury, but it was evident that if Lord Salisbury had entertained the view that a change was one which ought to be made, having, as he had in the year 1900, a complete command over both Houses, he would have carried it into effect. I note that in another place on that occasion Mr. Chaplin, who is, I am sure, a good Churchman, used the following expression. This proposition was made by Lord Hugh Cecil, and, a rather warm debate following, Mr. Chaplin said&#x2014;
<quote>"The fact that this proposal has called forth such heat is the best practical argument against inserting religious questions in the census."</quote>
Therefore, I think we are entitled to say that noble Lords opposite who desire this change ought to adduce some reasons for supposing that the circumstances have materially changed during the last ten years.<lb/>
Now have the circumstances changed? The most rev. Primate who has just sat down used arguments of which certainly do not deny the force, but which would have carried exactly the same weight ten or twenty years ago that they carry now, and the fact that the considerations which he adduced with regard to the value of a census of this kind, if it could be obtained, to general church work must have been brought before the Government of the day but did not persuade them to insert this provision, is one which I think ought to be noted. The Government, in considering a matter of this kind, have to ask two questions. They have to ask, do people generally wish a change of this kind to be made? and secondly, if it is made, will it serve any useful purpose? Up to the time when the most rev. Primate rose the argument in favour of the change was practically entirely based upon the question of the Welsh Church. What the noble Lord who moved the Amendment and what the two right rev. Prelates ask for is a referendum in Wales on the question of Disestablishment. They hope to obtain it by this insertion of a question in the census, and I think it is only fair to assume that
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0050"/>
<col>91</col>
they hope thus to obtain it in a form which will be generally favourable to the views which they support. I confess that I do not believe myself that if a definite referendum were taken upon the Disestablishment question in Wales it would lead to a result which would be conclusive or convincing. But if the matter is to be subjected to a direct inquiry to the people, by all means let it be done in regular form, and not be done in a manner which, as my noble friends behind me have pointed out, can only lead to an inaccurate and misleading result.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate complained of my noble friend the Lord President for a statement which he made that in such a matter you could only go by the views of the representatives returned to Parliament, and he asked whether Liberalism had come to this, that a man's religious opinions were to be the test of his being returned to Parliament. It seems to me that that is hardly, if the most rev. Primate will excuse me, a fair way of putting it. The question of the maintenance of the Church in Wales or of its disestablishment is not, in itself, a religious question. It is a political question, and I think it may be assumed that at any election in Wales, so long as the matter is before the country, the election to a very large extent will turn upon the question whether the candidate is or is not in favour of the disestablishment of the Church. I see no reason for taking this particular question out of the category of general political questions, the passing of which is generally assumed to be contingent on the securing of a majority of the representatives of the people in their favour who will proceed to legislate on the subject.<lb/>
The case of Ireland, and the historical reason for the application of this particular system to Ireland has been mentioned. I am bound to say, so far as my own experience goes, although I do not wish to lay down the law on the subject, I cannot recall any case within my own knowledge in which the possession of the facts obtained by a religious census was of any assistance to the Government of Ireland in arriving at any conclusion. It so happened that when I was partly responsible for the Government of Ireland we had to deal with difficult and intricate questions in relation to schools carried on by religious communities, but I cannot recall that on
<col>92</col>
that or on any other subject this particular ascertainment of results was of a special help to us. At the same time, if Ireland likes a religious census, and if it is, as it undoubtedly is, a country in which religions and those who profess them can be divided into water-tight compartments for the purposes of enumeration of this kind, by any means let Ireland have it; but I confess I am not convinced by anything that has been said that if we were to agree to the noble Lord's Amendment we should be doing anything which is at all popular in this country. I believe that the notion of a religious census of this kind would be thoroughly unpopular in England, and I have heard nothing from noble Lords opposite to lead me to alter that view.<lb/>
I think it is quite possible to press the inquisitorial argument too far. That argument is no doubt met to some extent by leaving it a matter of choice whether the return be made or not. On the other hand, I confess I am not convinced that the value, if value there be, of the return would not be very greatly diminished by the insertion of such a provision. I think you would get an enormous number of blank papers. You would get some, perhaps, flippantly filled up, and you would get many others misleadingly made up in the circumstances explained by my noble friend behind me, Lord Sheffield. Because, after all, the Church of England cannot be quite described as the noble Marquess opposite described it, possibly by accident but he did so describe it, as a denomination. I do not think that the most rev. Primate would agree that the Church of England should be spoken of as a denomination; and the mere fact that it is the established Church and is presumably the Church to which everybody belongs who is not an active member of some other religious body must surely vitiate an inquiry of this kind for the purposes for which alone it could be used. On this point the most rev. Primate was as fair as we always expect to find him. He said that a most liberal discount would have to be taken off any statistics arrived at in this way. I am sure that is so, but I am afraid everybody would not be so fair as the most rev. Primate, and that the figures, whatever they might prove to be, would be used unfairly and for misleading purposes by one side or the other, not necessarily only by those who desire to adduce particular
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0051"/>
<col>93</col>
arguments on behalf of the Church of England.<lb/>
I ask once more what are the useful purposes to which this census could be put. The noble Marquess opposite spoke of various great problems, educational and other, and seemed to think that some assistance might be gained by such a census. I confess I do not see in what respect a religious census of this kind would help us with regard to a solution of the education question. Where there is a question of the encouragement of schools carrying out one particular form of religious teaching, the point has always been assumed to be, not the number of individuals of a particular religious faith who live in the locality, but the number of parents who desire t heir children to obtain that particular kind of teaching. If, for instance, at some fashionable watering place there were a large number of elderly maiden ladies who belonged to the Church of England, the argument for a Church school in that particular town would be neither stronger nor weaker than it would be if those ladies lived somewhere else. Consequently from this point of view on this matter of education I do not see that we should be helped. The conclusion, therefore, which I have reached is the same which my noble friend behind me has reached, and is the conclusion of His Majesty's Government. I cannot regard this as in any sense a Party question, and I have no reason that it should be so regarded; but as we happen for the time being to be responsible for the form in which this census is taken, we cannot make ourselves responsible for an addition to the form which in our view would be fictitious and misleading; and, speaking generally, it seems to me undesirable to include in a census paper voluntary questions</membercontribution></p>

I should equally deprecate an inquiry, although it might be an interesting one from some points of view, as to whether a man described himself as a Unionist or as a Liberal. I take it that a large number of the inhabitants of this country would refuse to describe themselves as either. It seems to me undesirable, when the State is making an inquiry of this kind, although, of course, I am aware of the precedents to the contrary in other countries and in our Colonies, to depart from those questions to which the State says it has an absolute right to demand an answer, and therefore I fear we cannot recede from our determination not to accept the noble Lord's Amendment.</p>

<title>INDECENT ADVERTISEMENTS (AMENDMENT) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00277" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00278">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00279"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill which I submit in the hope that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading, and I think I shall not be disappointed in this hope. The object of the Bill is to strengthen the law against the publication of improper advertisements. The first and last Bill on this subject became law in 1889. It was introduced in this House in 1888, and was piloted through in the following year by an eminent philanthropist whose name we all revere, Lord Meath; and it met with no opposition, so far as my recollection goes, in either House of Parliament. The provisions of that Bill were designed to prevent the custom which had obtained for many years of posting objectionable placards and advertisements up and down the country.<lb/>
Prior to the passing of the Indecent Advertisements Act of 1889 anybody who wished to do so was absolutely at liberty to post these objectionable papers, not only in places where they might be expected to be placed and where they would have been out of sight of the general
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0053"/>
<col>97</col>
public, but also along the highways and byways of this country. I say advisedly the byways, because not only on the turnpike roads were these advertisements displayed, but actually in country lanes. They became, therefore, doubly and trebly conspicuous because of the fact that they were the only printed matter in these county places, which one would have hoped would have been protected from intrusion. That was the state of affairs prior to 1889; but when the Act of that year became law these objectionable advertisements disappeared like magic from one end of the country to the other. That Act, therefore, did an immense amount of good. It went very far, but it did not go quite far enough, in the opinion of those who support the measure now before your Lords-ships, because it did not prevent the introduction of objectionable matter of the kind which is detailed in this Bill, and which I need not refer to further, into newspapers and leaflets. There has been an appalling increase of that kind of literature in this country. I am sure that that nebulous personage the historian of the future, to whose unwritten records appeal is so often made, will find it incredible to believe that such a state of things could have existed in a European country. I think that this Bill, the general scope of which I have sketched, will go a great way, together with the Act of 1889, to put a stop to this evil. The newspapers referred to are not, of course, the general public newspapers, but there are every kind and every degree of publication from the highest to the lowest possible class; and in addition to newspapers there are leaflets and circulars, or what might possibly be dignified by the name of magazines&#x2014;half-penny magazines&#x2014;in circulation. At committees and meetings to which these matters have been referred prior to the bringing forward in Parliament of this Bill some of these publications have been handed round, and have certainly made a very unfavourable impression.<lb/>
The Act of 1889 has had considerable effect in preventing the distribution of certain classes of unsavoury advertisements; but the definition of indecent advertisements in that Act has been found not to be wide enough to cover a number of advertisements of a character similar to those struck at by the Act. And while powers exist under the Post Office Protection Act of 1884 for preventing the circulation
<col>98</col>
of such matter by post, there are no adequate or summary means of suppressing the publication in newspapers of advertisements which it is illegal to distribute in the streets. I do not think there will be any objection in this House to the principle of the Bill. On the contrary, I feel certain that your Lordships will welcome it and wish it godspeed, not only here but in another place, and will desire it to become law as soon as possible.<lb/>
There is only one difficulty, perhaps, and it is contained in Clause 3, subsection (5), in which, in the case of a medical man writing a <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> medical or scientific treatise or book of any kind on these topics, the <i>onus probandi</i> as to the literary character of the work or the <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> medical or scientific character of the treatise is placed on the writer. Your Lordships must bear in mind that no prosecution can be instituted without the previous consent in writing of the chief officer of police of the district in which the offence is alleged to have been committed, or of two Justices of the Peace, or of a stipendiary magistrate having jurisdiction in such district. That is in addition to the consent of the Public Prosecutor, and I do not think any difficulty is likely to arise under that enactment.

Neither the Memorandum to the Bill nor the speech of the noble Lord has really dealt with everything that the Bill contains. In addition to striking at these advertisements the Bill contains a rather important provision in Clause 2 which was not alluded to by the noble Lord. That these advertisements and any public exhibition of things of this kind should be put down I think we agree, and we have all been able to recognise the good done by the previous Act; but while the object of this Bill will command sympathy,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0054"/>
<col>99</col>
the drafting of its provisions is open to some little criticism. I should be sorry to see it in its present form placed upon the Statute Book, and I should be glad to hear that the noble Lord did not propose to do more than obtain a pious assent to the general principle to-night, without carrying the Bill in its present shape much further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00282"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Earl will pardon me for pointing out that the provision depends on the words "shall exhibit to public view." It is exhibition which is aimed at in this clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00283"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: If your Lordships will look at the marginal note to Clause 2 you will see that it provides a "penalty for exhibiting certain appliances of an improper character." The opening words are, "Whosoever shall exhibit to public view in any house or shop &#x2026;" Unless the word "exhibit" is to be taken to have a technical meaning and to mean an exhibition to which the public are invited, it would render liable to a penalty any person who accidentally exposed any of these things in any portion of a dwelling-house or in a bedroom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00284"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: I think it is to be taken to mean exhibit for sale.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00285"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to discuss the details across the floor of the House if I can help it, but I think your Lordships will see that this as it stands really does not hit the very mischief intended to be aimed at. What is probably intended to be aimed at is the exposure of these things for sale in the street or in a shop window, so that they meet the eye of the passer-by when he does not wish to see them and are forced upon his attention. It is to be noted&#x2014;I think it is an entirely new departure&#x2014;that certain things are included connected with Malthusian practices which I think require some little consideration before they are dealt with exactly on the same level as the other mischief aimed at in the Bill.<lb/>
It is to be noted, too, that by Clause 3, subsection (4), there is to be no prosecution without the previous consent in writing of the chief officer of police of the district in which the offence is alleged to have been committed, or of two Justices of the Peace. I do not know whether it is usual to
<col>100</col>
put in a sanction of that character to a prosecution. With sanction by the Attorney-General, or perhaps the Public Prosecutor, one is fairly well acquainted, but there is no precedent for a provision of this kind, and it is doubtful whether it is desirable in that form.<lb/>
As to the provision in subsection (5) to which the noble Lord called attention, I do not altogether object to the onus of proof being thrown upon the person who is defending a publication to show that it is a <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> medical or scientific treatise; it must depend ultimately on the common-sense of the Court that tries the question. I recollect, and I read with some care, the Report of the Committee presided over by the noble Earl on the Front Bench which dealt with this matter. This Bill does not quite agree with the Report of that Committee, and I think the noble Lord must feel that if it is to go further the enacting words of the Bill will require careful scrutiny.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00286"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF LONDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say a few words in support of the Second Reading of this Bill, not so much in my individual capacity, but as Chairman of the Public Morality Council for London, which includes every Christian denomination and the Jewish community. It is really our Bill which the noble Lord has been good enough to introduce. I should like to make plain the great good that has been done by the Act which was piloted through by Lord Meath. It is twenty-one years since the Indecent Advertisements Act became law. It has worked well and has been extremely beneficial in London; but it became plain, as so often happens, that there were certain loopholes in the Act. I hold in my hand most disgusting advertisements, with the reading of which I will not defile your Lordships' ears, which it has been found impossible to deal with under the existing Act. A public agitation was carried on for some four or five years eventuating in the appointment of a Joint Committee. After very careful investigation that Committee reported, and in their Report they pointed out that the Act did not make it an offence to circulate such advertisements as these in the shape of handbills inserted in books and magazines sold to the public, and also that the Act did not refer to advertisements printed in newspaper periodicals.
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0055"/>
<col>101</col>
The Joint Committee pointed out the loophole in the Act which the Bill before your Lordships seeks to fill.<lb/>
There was also another defect. Clause 3 of this Bill simply makes good an omission in the previous Act. At the present time while it is an offence to distribute or send through the post handbills advertising certain drugs or offering for sale certain mechanical appliances, the same handbill can be printed and circulated in a newspaper and the present Act cannot be brought to bear. To have such advertisements in newspapers which circulate among the masses of the people is an evil infinitely greater than the handbills, and the clause simply extends the prohibition to newspapers. I can only say, on behalf of the Council I represent, that we very seldom come here for help in our efforts in the cause of morality. We only come to your Lordships' House to seek for help by means of legislation when some serious obstacle stands in our way and retards our work. I sincerely hope that your Lordships will give a Second Reading to this Bill, because I believe these advertisements which are scattered broadcast, and these shops exhibiting to public view these appliances, are most demoralising to unmarried people in making vice easy, and still more demoralising to young married people into whose hands they fall, and are degrading to public morality generally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00287"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the author of the Bill which twenty-one years ago became the Act which it is now proposed to amend, it is a pleasure to me to hear that that Act has been of some service, and to read in the Memorandum attached to the Bill under discussion that the Act of 1889 has had considerable effect in preventing the distribution of certain classes of unsavoury advertisements. But an amendment of that Act is undoubtedly needed. I may say that 1 introduced certain words in the original Bill which would have prevented the possibility of these advertisements being issued in newspapers, but in its passage through Parliament those words were deleted. The noble Lord, Lord Braye, proposes to go still further than I did, and in doing that he has my most sympathetic support. It is not so very many years ago since a right rev. Prelate who is noted for his eloquence made a splendid speech in this House&#x2014;the right rev. Prelate is present&#x2014;on this very subject which has been alluded to
<col>102</col>
of Malthusianism, and he pointed out the terrible effects which were taking place in the population owing to these doctrines advocating the restriction of the birth-rate. The evils which the right rev. Prelate pointed out in 1903 are very much greater now than they were at that time. The right rev. Prelate quoted an enormous mass of statistics on that occasion&#x2014;I believe without any notes at all, to my extreme admiration&#x2014;but one of the few figures I remember was that the birth-rate in the year 1876 was 36&#x00B7;3 and that in the year 1898 it was 29&#x00B7;4 per thousand. In 1907 we had gone further in a retrograde direction; and now the birth-rate is 26&#x00B7;3. The right rev. Prelate told us at that time&#x2014;I think he took it front some figures given by Mr. Edward Cannon&#x2014;that in 1880 the size of families was 4&#x00B7;34; at the end of 1890, 4&#x00B7;08; and at the end of 1900, 3&#x00B7;63. There are no figures that I know of that will absolutely show what the size of families now is, but if you take those proportions you find that about three is the size of the average family nowadays. In other words, there are about 2,000,000 less children in the land than there would have been if we had maintained the standard of these former years. The Registrar-General, in his last Report, says there can be little doubt that much of this is due to wilful restriction in child-bearing. I think it is most important, if we are to preserve not only the purity of our families but the very Empire itself, that we should take this matter into consideration. We own one fifth of the earth's surface, a great mass of which is quite capable of being filled up by people of the Anglo-Saxon race, and unless we are prepared to accept that duty and to fill those lands the British Empire cannot last. It is late, and I do not intend to detain your Lordships further than to say that we have recently heard, and I am sure all of us with great pleasure, words coming from the very highest quarter. Those words made a great impression upon me when I read them. They were&#x2014;

<image src="S5LV0006P0I0056"/>
<col>103</col>
Government. to express general approval of the principle of the Bill which the noble Lord has introduced. I had the honour some years ago of being Chairman of the Committee to which reference has already been made by the noble and learned Earl behind me. The members of the Committee realised the need of further legislation on the subject, and we did indeed definitely recommend the passing of a Bill which would consolidate and amend the existing law as well as extend it in some directions. It was brought rather forcibly to our minds that the whole subject should be dealt with in a single Bill if possible, and that the laws already existing should be consolidated. We did not feel that the matter would otherwise be adequately dealt with. The Home Office are entirely sympathetic with the objects and principle of this Bill, and I believe Lord Gladstone, before he left office, had intended to introduce a Bill on the lines recommended by our Committee, but the state of public business at the time did not allow him to proceed with the matter. I am, however, able to say that the present Home Secretary takes the same view as his predecessor did as to the desirability of legislation on this subject, and he hopes to be able to take the whole matter into consideration. I think, therefore, with this intimation we may give the Bill of the noble Lord a Second Reading, but I hope he will not press it beyond that stage.<lb/>
There is a <i>caveat</i> which I desire to enter in connection with the matter. The objection which is felt by the Home Office to the Bill is that it only deals with a portion and not with the whole of the question. The subject is much larger than might be inferred from merely looking at the Memorandum and the Bill as introduced by the noble Lord. In our opinion what is really wanted is a consolidating and amending Bill dealing with the whole subject, and it is with a Bill of that kind that. His Majesty's Government hope to proceed on a subsequent occasion. In those circumstances, and in view of the condition of business in another place and also here, I venture to submit to the noble Lord whether there is any prospect of proceeding successfully with the Bill during the present session. There is a good deal to be said, which I will not trouble your Lordships with at the present time, upon the wording of the Bill, which is, in the opinion of the Home Office, very faulty and needs considerable amendment.
<col>104</col>
If the noble Lord was to proceed to Committee stage His Majesty's Government, if it was likely that the Bill would pass into law, would be obliged to make a very large number of alterations in it. I venture to hope, therefore, that having passed the Second Reading of the Bill this afternoon in order to show our general sympathy with the noble Lord, he will be satisfied with that step for the present; and if he will be so good as to place himself in communication with the Home Office&#x2014;and I address the same invitation to the right rev. Prelate&#x2014;I am sure that Department will be very glad indeed to consider anything placed before them, and to take both the noble Lord and the right rev. Prelate into consultation before bringing in that larger Bill to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00289"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF RIPON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I may be allowed for a few moments to trouble your Lordships with one or two observations on this matter. The noble Earl who has just sat down expressed a hope that this Bill will be given a Second Reading. I do earnestly trust that that will be the case. Butt some sentences that fell from him seemed to foreshadow modifications, and one would be very glad to know what direction those modifications are likely to take. I sincerely trust that there will be no modification of those parts of the Bill which in any way touch on what we generally call the practice of restriction of population in this country. As the noble Earl who sits on the Cross Benches has reminded us, this subject is one of supreme and Imperial importance.<lb/>
According to the Registrar-General's returns of the last census it is reckoned that the loss to this country in the birthrate represented two per cent. in thirty years. But, my Lords, that was followed by what seems to me a far more important fact which marked a far more dangerous condition of affairs, namely, that the loss of birth force&#x2014;that is a technical phrase but it expresses a well-known meaning&#x2014;was 19&#x00B7;5 per cent. Now if it is the fact that there is this great diminution of birth force going on in this country I think we ought to take care that in a Bill of this sort we do put on record our determined hostility to those practices which are calculated to bring about a further diminution of the birthrate. May I point out what is the real
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0057"/>
<col>105</col>
danger, which is combated, I think, by this Bill? I have made inquiries in various towns where the population is large. I will take time Midland towns for the purposes of illustration, and select Nottingham, Birmingham, Leicester, and Derby as representing the Midlands. From inquiries I made in those towns from those who were in an official position and able to speak authoritatively on the subject, I find that the use of diachylon or oleate of lead, generally given out in the form of pills, is very frequent in every one of those localities. When I go to the great seaports of Bristol and Hull I find the same sort of report. When I go to Salford the same thing is expressed as being true, and when I pass to Sunderland I am told that in the view of the chemists this practice is one which is alarming in its extent. As a result of advertisements in the newspapers many persons carry out the practice which leads to the restriction of population by means of what really is a. systematic course of lead poisoning.<lb/>
Your Lordships may not be aware of all the significance of that word "diachylon." For my own part I wish it could be brought within the scope of legislation to put diachylon amongst those scheduled drugs which ought not to be sold by chemists without special permit. The use of diachylon means that a process of lead poisoning is resorted to by those mothers who desire to avoid the birth of the child. It means, therefore, not only what is commonly called race suicide, but much more than that, for it must be remembered that every time the birth of a child is stopped in this way the mother-strength of the country is being seriously impaired. The use of this drug, in whatever form it is given, in the long run tends to undermine the health and the strength of the woman who takes it, arid, according to the outspoken record of the medical officer of health for Nottingham, who knows how widespread the practice is, this is a form of poisoning which leads to blindness, paralysis, insanity, and even death. Case after case has occurred in many quarters, not only in the Midlands but in the East of London; and your Lordships will find in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> and elsewhere reports of such cases and of prosecutions which have sometimes followed.<lb/>
The decline of the birth-rate and the undermining of women's health are a
<col>106</col>
serious national evil, and as surely as the practice I have spoken of prevails so surely will the evil exist. The practice is one which is brought to the notice of the inexperienced girl, or the ignorant young married woman, by means of specious advertisements&#x2014; advertisements which suggest to the ignorant that some kind-spirited, soft hearted, generous minded person is prepared to give motherly help to poor unfortunate women who are driven to seek help by the hard circumstances of necessity. In this way these poisonous pills are sold and consumed to the detriment of health and to the destruction of the population that might be. My Lords, these things are far too serious for us to treat by, shall I call them, hypothetical clauses in a Bill. I rise for the purpose of urging that, whatever other change is going to be made, those words which touch this question of the restriction of population should be emphasised in the Bill, because in this day of national history we cannot afford to stand by and see methods adopted which tend to the diminution of our population and to the impairment of the moral energy of the Empire.</membercontribution></p>

Perhaps I had better explain the posit ion very shortly. The part the Charity Commissioners have taken during the last fifty years in framing schemes for the trusts of charities does not extend beyond the power
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0058"/>
<col>107</col>
exercised by Courts of Equity. The Act of 1853 empowered the Commissioners in certain cases to go to Parliament to approve schemes which presumably went beyond the ordinary power, but the eases in which the Commissioners have gone to Parliament to approve schemes have been very rare indeed. In many years there have been none at all, and in other years very few. On the other hand, under their ordinary jurisdiction the Commissioners have been in the habit of approving schemes by scores and hundreds, and I feel that the very fact that the Legislature requires that in certain cases a scheme should not become law except with the assent of Parliament indicates that it was beyond the ordinary powers of the Commissioners and of the Courts, and that therefore something exceptional was proposed. I do not for one moment suggest that in the case of this particular Bill every provision of the Bill is not entirely justified, but what I do want to draw the attention of this House to is the fact that if it once began to allow these Bills to go through as a matter of course, the whole of the principles upon which the revision of the trusts of charities is carried out might in course of time imperceptibly be very seriously changed, and the result, in my humble judgment at any rate, would be to deter pious founders and benefactors, as they are called, from founding charities. I have no doubt whatever that the noble Lord can give a perfectly valid explanation of the reason why a Bill is necessary in this case, but I do hope that in all future cases of Charity Bills your Lordships will insist on being told why it is necessary to proceed by Bill instead of by means of the ordinary jurisdiction possessed by the Commissioners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00295"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I may be able to satisfy the noble Lord on the point he has raised, which is really one of a rather technical character. The Charity Commissioners are obliged to come to Parliament because of an alteration of the area affected by the charities in this Bill. As I said on Second Reading, the object is to consolidate certain charities in the City of Norwich. There are thirty-six parishes having charities, some specially for one parish only, and some for groups of two or three parishes, and it was really impossible to effect the consolidation of these charities for Norwich as a whole under the ordinary jurisdiction of the Commissioners. This is the chief reason.
<col>108</col>
There are other minor reasons into which I hope at this late hour the noble Lord may not think it necessary for me to enter. I am well aware that he speaks with great authority on this subject generally, but I hope he will consider the reason I have given sufficient and that he will not deem it necessary to oppose the passage of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00300"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to call the attention of your Lordships' House to paragraph 55 on page 26 of the schedule. Your Lordships will, I am sure, agree that when any Act of Parliament is being administered, whether by a bureau or a body of trustees, there should certainly be a right of appeal to a Court of law for an interpretation of the Act if it is considered that anything is being done contrary to the intention of the Act. The paragraph to which I refer, and the deletion of which I propose to move, contains an extraordinary contradiction. Clause 1 of the Bill says that the said scheme as amended is hereby confirmed, provided always that nothing in this Act or in the said scheme shall be held to interfere with the ordinary jurisdiction over endowed charities now exercisable, or hereafter to become exercisable, by the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commissioners. But the particular paragraph&#x2014;paragraph 55 in the schedule&#x2014;which deals with questions under the scheme runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Any question as to the construction of this Scheme, or as to the regularity or the validity of any acts done or about to be done under this Scheme, shall be determined conclusively by the Charity Commissioners, upon such application made to them for the purpose as they think sufficient."</quote>
The point is whether this paragraph does or does not take away the intention of the Act, or whether there is still a right of appeal to the Courts of Justice for an interpretation of the Act. It seems to me that the first clause and this paragraph contradict each other, and I feel strongly that there is a great endeavour nowadays being made for bureaux themselves to be allowed to interpret an Act of Parliament instead of a Court of Justice. I therefore move to leave out this paragraph, and I
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0059"/>

shall press the Amendment unless the noble Lord opposite can assure me that the paragraph does not do away with the right of appeal to a Court of Justice.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00302"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BARNARD</member><membercontribution>: I would venture to appeal to my noble friend not to proceed with this Amendment. My desire is not to oppose the Bill, but, on I he contrary, to support it. The paragraph in question&#x2014;paragraph 55&#x2014;was framed a great number of years ago. There are hundreds of schemes in existence, and this clause has been put into every one of them, and in the course of my ten years experience actually in the office of the Charity Commissioners, in addition to having since had a pretty close acquaintance with charities and charity administration, I have never heard the faintest suspicion of this provision having worked badly or improperly. I think that of itself shows that in actual practice it is a very reasonable clause. I may, perhaps, be permitted to point out to my noble friend that you cannot take away the right of individuals to have an authoritative decision upon a disputed question with regard to the construction of a trust. In ordinary circumstances the Court of Equity is the proper. Court to decide such a point as that, but in former days a terrible scandal was created by the way in which charity funds were frittered away in applications to the Court to decide questions of this kind. It was therefore determined, and it has worked well for about half a century, that a body paid by the public should decide these questions; and they are bound, by Clause 1 of the Bill, to decide them in accordance with the principles of the law. If the Charity Commissioners exceed their authority the Courts have power to put them right, and we all know from recent experience in the case of a Battersea or Streatham Hospital, where the Commissioners exceeded their powers, that the Courts insisted upon the charity being put back into the original position. So that I think my noble friend need have no fear whatever that the Commissioners will go beyond the powers they possess, and I hope he will take my assurance from my practical experience on the subject, and not ask the House to divide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00303"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope t lie noble Viscount; will accept the powerful
<col>110</col>
appeal which has just been made by the noble Lord on the Bench opposite. It is really not a case, as the noble Viscount suggests, of a bureaucracy endeavouring to get more power for itself. The Charity Commissioners are not quite in the same position as a Government Department. They are appointed by Royal Warrant in the same way as His Majesty's Judges, their functions are of a <i>quasi</i>-Judicial character, and the Commissioners themselves have had a legal training and experience which fit them to deal with cases of the kind that will come up to them as contemplated in the Bill. Furthermore, they have been allowed by Parliament to have this power, as the noble Lind opposite said. There have been similar clauses since the year 1856 inserted in Charity Commission Bills, and what is an even stronger point is that in the year 1883 the Court of Chancery adopted a method whereby their schemes were construed by the Charity Commissioners themselves. Surely if the Court of Chancery asked the Charity Commissioners to undertake to construe their own schemes it must be conceded that the Charity Commissioners are capable of so doing. The points that come before them are often points of a very minor character that really it would be almost absurd to take to a Court of law&#x2014;which might mean the absorption altogether of the funds provided by the Charity. I will give your Lordships one instance of the kind of question that comes before them: There was a scheme that gave power to contribute for the maintenance of a nurse for a parish, and the trustees differed as to whether they could contribute to the maintenance of a nurse who served another parish as well. These arc the kind of very minor points which, as I say, it would be almost ridiculous to refer to a Court of law. I trust, therefore, that the noble Viscount will not divide the House. It is really not a matter which affects the interest of the Government at all, but if the Amendment of the noble Viscount were carried and the paragraph omitted, it might seriously affect the interests of people in very humble circumstances who might be prevented from availing themselves of these charitable trusts. I therefore hope that the noble Viscount will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

although I confess that the two speeches we have just listened to have made out a very strong case for the retention of these words.

In the first place, it is clear from what the noble Lord, Lord Barnard, with his great knowledge of the subject has told us, that these words do not, in point of fact, oust the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts of Justice. He has instanced a recent case in which, notwithstanding words like these, an appeal to the Court was successfully sustained.</membercontribution></p>

He gave your Lordships to understand that, in his opinion, there was always an appeal to a Court of Justice against excessive jurisdiction on the part of the Charity Commissioners notwithstanding these words. That is one consideration which I think of great importance. Another is that the noble Lord, speaking with his responsibility as representing the Government, emphasised the fact that in this respect the Charity Commissioners are to be trusted because they are an impartial semi-Judicial body. I agree that the Charity Commissioners are so at present. That was the case also at one time with regard to other charities, not merely charities such as this Bill deals with; but in an evil moment the Education Department were allowed to supersede the Charity Commissioners in respect of those charities, and we know what the Education Department's views of a semi-Judicial function really are.

He made an attack in somewhat violent terms upon one of my right hon. friends, and it did not seem to me entirely irrelevant to ask him the question as to when the change was made. What I understand he objects to is that a public Department should have the Charity Commissioners' powers, and I think I am entitled to assume, if the noble Marquess is right in thinking that it is impossible for a politician to exercise those powers impartially, that that must apply to politicians upon both sides and not only upon one.</membercontribution></p>

But it is not material whether it is a question of a Liberal Government or a Conservative Government.

<title>THE ROAD BOARD.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00314"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. What funds are at present available for the use of the Road Board, and whit funds will be available for 1910&#x2013;1911.</li>
<li>2. Whether any representation is to be given to local authorities or to bodies representative of their interests.</li>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0061"/>
<col>113</col>
<li>3. Whether any official announcement will be made as to the policy of the Road Board during the coming autumn and winter.</li>
<li>4. What is the estimated charge for salaries and departmental expenses for 1910&#x2013;1911.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00315">The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is now so late that I propose to be very brief in putting these Questions to His Majesty's Government. It is particularly unfortunate, as there are several points connected with this subject with regard to which I am sure they would like to give information to the country. Before proceeding further may I say that I am sure noble Lords will sympathise deeply with the noble Lord (Lord Llangattock) whose son (the Hon. C. S. Rolls) has met with such a sad accident to-day. Science is constantly claiming its victims, and the pursuit of it will always be attended with the risk of human life. I trust the life that has been given to-day will not have been given in vain. In connection with the Questions that I have put on the Paper, I would first like to congratulate His Majesty's Government on the appointment at last of the members of the Road Board. Some of us criticise the composition of the Board on the ground that it contains gentlemen who have not so far been particularly notable on the question of roads, and if I were asked what was the predominant feature of the Road Board my reply would be that those concerned in it are mainly notable by reason of their connection with railways. Still, sometimes a converted poacher makes a good gamekeeper, and although the Chairman of the Board and the noble Lord opposite to me in past times have displayed great interest in railways, I trust they will use the knowledge they so gained for the benefit of the roads. This Road Board has huge responsibilities and will have a very considerable revenue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00316">At the present moment there are nearly 150,000 miles of roads in this country, 28,000 main roads, and 120,000 secondary reads. I trust the Board will shape their policy with a view to improving not only the main roads but the secondary roads as well. They will have to decide what claims the diminution of dust has over the question of dangerous corners and the straightening of roads, and if they have anything like the amount of money foreshadowed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer they will
<col>114</col>
have something like &#x00A3;600,000 a year. I trust that their policy will be one of conciliating local authorities to start with, because they must work with the local authorities, who are by law absolutely independent of them, and the success of the Board's policy will depend to a certain extent on bow they treat them. The county surveyor is also a most important person to be considered, and they should try and get him to work in with their schemes. I trust that they will make their grants in ratio to the efficiency of the work done by various counties, and not give undue grants to counties which have always been backward in making roads and resisting the trend of events by keeping their roads bad in order to avoid traffic coming over them. They are limited in the Act to one-third of their revenue being spent on new roads. I think that is wise, but I trust they will not leave out of consideration altogether the importance of exits from cities. London, in particular, the largest city in the world, has probably the meanest exits of any. That is a subject requiring the greatest attention. I have seen noble Lords struggling in the narrow neck of Brentford, apparently swearing to themselves, and not only noble Lords but a great many other people also. It would be a great improvement if they could make by-roads for avoiding roads in certain places.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00317">Then the question of dust, the greatest plague that has attended this new kind of traction, will require careful consideration and if they can give grants even in the smallest degree to the local authorities who have already dealt with this question themselves they will be doing a very good work. Nearly the whole of the main roads of Kent are now tarred; that example ought to be followed by other counties, and is being followed to a large degree. Great credit must be given to the county surveyors who have dealt with this question already, and I trust the Road Board will keep the dust nuisance in the forefront of their programme. I am sure noble Lords on this side of the House wish the Road Board well, and speaking for the motoring community we wish it every success. We think that representation might be given in two ways&#x2014;first, that the local authorities, either through the County Councils Association or some other authority, might be given representation; and, secondly, that the interest of heavy traction ought to have
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0062"/>
<col>115</col>
some representation. I do not mean heavy traction of sixteen tons, but heavy van traction, which is becoming very extensive on the roads and ought to have sonic representation. I think that would add to the usefulness of the Board. I trust that the Board will form the nucleus of a far <i>bigger</i> Department some day which will take up the question of national roads and work them in a national sense. I wish we had more time to discuss this matter, but as it is so late I simply ask the Questions which I have put upon the Paper, and I hope the noble Lord who will reply will be able to enlighten us with regard to the points I have put forward.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00318"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am ashamed at this late hour to interpose even for one moment, but if the noble Lord opposite will excuse me I want to say one word on Question 2, as to whether any representation will be given to local authorities. The Road Board, in my view also, has a great future before it. It is limited a little unfortunately, as I said at the time, by the Act which constitutes it, hut no doubt in time those limitations will disappear. For my part I differ from my noble friend opposite in one thing. I am anxious that the Road Board should represent nothing but the interests of the roads. I think it is unfortunate that the members should be regarded as representing this or that particular interest in the constitution of the Board. The Board has been formed to some extent on that basis, but with members so excellent I do not think we need have anything to fear. I should not like to see a Road Board formed with the idea that particular interests should be represented all pulling this way and that when the various schemes are discussed. The Road Board should consist of strong men having regard merely to the question of the roads themselves, of course working harmoniously with the various interests concerned. I do not know whether the Board is to he drawn as to any official announcement, and I hesitate to tender advice to members of the Board so astute as the noble Lord behind me; but if I were to tender any advice it would be that they should hesitate before announcing anything in the nature of a policy at all, and that they should spend a good deal of time in informing themselves as to the very considerable difficulties winch exist in dealing with this question before they commit themselves to any public statement.</membercontribution></p>
<col>116</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00319"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: With regard to Question 2, I wish to say one word on behalf of the County Councils Association, who have always strongly urged that the local authorities who are to be partners in the work of the Road Board should be represented on that Board, and although I can say nothing. about the nature of the communications which led us to suppose that some attention was going to be given to this matter, I think the noble Lord who answers the Questions, if he inquires, will find that something in the way of an expectancy that this might be done was held out to us. I hope, therefore, that whenever an opportunity arrives in the future he may be able to assure us that something will be done to give the local authorities some means, by way of representation, of making their views known in the councils of the Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00320"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: MY Lords, I desire to associate myself with what has fallen from the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, with regard to the late Mr. Rolls, whose terribly sudden death was announced this afternoon. Re was one of the pioneers of motoring and aviation, and certainly one of the most skilful and pluckiest of them, a man whom this country can ill afford to lose, and I am sure your Lordships will deeply sympathise with Lord and lady Llangattock in the cruel bereavement which has fallen upon them.<lb/>
The answers to the Questions which the noble Lord has put on the Paper are as follow. With regard to the funds, there is already available a sum of approximately &#x00A3;300,000 in respect of the proceeds of the Motor Spirit Duty, less the cost of collection, for 1909&#x2013;10; and there will be available in respect of the current financial year the net proceeds of that duty for 1910&#x2013;11 and the proceeds of motor-car licences for 1909&#x2013;10 and 1910&#x2013;11. The estimated receipts from the Spirit Duty for 1910&#x2013;11 will be &#x00A3;400,000, and from motor-car licences for the two years &#x00A3;520,000, making a total of &#x00A3;920,000. From that total must be deducted the cost of collection, which cannot be precisely ascertained at present.<lb/>
As to the constitution of the Road Board, I am glad to find that there is no criticism of the <i>personnel</i> of this body. There is no special representative of local authorities, as the House is aware, on the Board at present. It was overlooked when the appointments were being made, but since
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0063"/>
<col>117</col>
then the Chancellor of the Exchequer has promised to consider whether or not it will be possible to grant some such representation. I cannot give the noble Lord any more definite information on that point at present.<lb/>
As to Question 3, the Road Board intend to issue shortly a circular to county councils and highway authorities which will contain such indications of policy as the Board are in a position to give. As to Question 4. The salaries of the staff already sanctioned by the Treasury amount to &#x00A3;5,028 per annum in all. It is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the departmental expenses for the year, but probably the cost of any additional staff that may be required and the departmental expenses, including office rent and furnishing, will not exceed &#x00A3;2,000. With regard to the other points raised by the noble Lord, I fortunately induced a member of the Road Board to be present to-night, and I am quite sure he will give every attention to those points.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00321"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Lord for his answer, which throws a good deal of light on the question. The fact that the Road Board have nearly a million to spend is very cheering, and I hope they will make a very good show for it. I am glad that His Majesty's Government have appointed a secretary with whom we are very satisfied and in whom we have great confidence, and an engineer who has had so many years experience and study of the subject.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ST. ANDREWS UNIVERSITY<lb/> REGULATIONS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00322"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> rose to move that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying him to withhold his assent from the words "or diminishing" in.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00323">The Lord said: My Lords, the Motion that stands in my name on the Paper is rather in the nature of using a steam hammer to crack a nut, but it is necessary to make a formal address to the Crown in order to get a small amendment made in a matter of this kind. The particular section gives the right to the University Court of St. Andrews to make certain regulations with regard to the
<col>118</col>
conditions under which medical degrees may be taken. It is obviously not right, I think, that any one University Court should have the right of diminishing the amount of education or the length of time to be given before a medical degree can be taken. How the words got into the ordinance I am unable to say, but, acting as Chancellor of the University concerned, I suggest that in the interest of the University it would be right to present this Address, and so get the amendment made. I am sure it will be right, and I am sorry there is no other way of doing it.</p>

<title>IMPERIAL AND LOCAL FINANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00349"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member> rose to call attention to the financial relations between the Imperial Exchequer and local authorities, and to the inadequacy of the present grants in aid of local taxation having regard to the annually increasing duties thrown upon local authorities by Parliament; and to move for a Return giving particulars of the financial relations in the principal foreign countries and in British possessions between the central and the local governments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00350">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in rising to propose the Motion which stands in my name I feel that some apology is due to your Lordships for introducing the well-worn topic of local taxation which has already been the subject of many debates in this House. About two years ago the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees introduced a somewhat similar discussion when he moved for a Return bringing up to date the Blue-book known as the Fowler Return, which was issued in 1893 by Sir Henry Fowler, who has since become an honoured member of your Lordships' House. A very interesting discussion took place on that occasion, although the Government excused themselves, on the score of the labour involved in a busy session, from granting the Return asked for by Lord Onslow; but the Leader of the House undertook to confer with the President of the Local Government Board with a
<col>122</col>
view to affording of the information desired. In these circumstances Lord Onslow did not press his Motion, and, so far as I am aware, the Fowler Return, which relates to the expenditure of the various local authorities throughout the country, has not been brought up to any date more recent than 1893.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00351">There is, of course, a good deal of statistical information issued by the Local Government Board in its annual Report to Parliament, and some particulars also contained in the annual local taxation returns. There is, in fact, no lack of statistical material in connection with local finance, but the subject is so vast&#x2014;I might say so complicated&#x2014;that few people desire to struggle through the details. But if any excuse is required for introducing this subject again, I think it may be found in the fact that so many members of this House are especially well qualified to deal with this subject owing to their great experience in local administration. We also have the advantage in this House of many members who have not only had to look at this question from the point of view of local administration, but also from the somewhat different attitude of Ministers of the Crown responsible for the relations of the central government to the various local authorities. These facts, together with the growing importance of the financial aspect of local government, encourage me to believe that your Lordships may not regard a discussion of the Motion which I have the honour to bring forward as altogether a waste of your Lordships' time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00352">I desire this afternoon to deal more particularly with the position which is arising in regard to the grants from the Imperial Exchequer towards the expense of certain services of local authorities. I suppose there must always be a certain amount of rivalry between local and Imperial claims, as there will always be some divergence of opinion as regards services which are of a purely local and those which partake of a more national character. This division of the services administered by local authorities formed much of the consideration which was given to this subject of local taxation by the Royal Commission on Local Taxation which was presided over by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh with so much ability. That Commission reported as far back as 1901, and I am sorry that so
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0066"/>
<col>123</col>
little progress has been made since that date by any Government in dealing, with this question. But I am glad to acknowledge that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his recent Budget statement, informed us that in his opinion this question of the readjustment of local and Imperial finance could not be postponed beyond the year, and that whoever occupied the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer next year would have to deal with it. I confess that I should like a fuller assurance from His Majesty's Government that they do intend to deal with this question at an early date, for the financial aspect of it is really most important. I might almost add, without being inaccurate, that it is most depressing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00353">Certainly from the point of view of an economist there is little that is reassuring in a survey or our public expenditure, while the position of the unfortunate ratepayer is a grave reflection on our system of local self-government. And what is the reason? I think the real reason, the root of the matter, is to be found in our system of municipal representation. There are far too many electors in this country who care nothing about the rates. Many of them imagine that they pay no rates, owing to our unfortunate system of compounding. I think there is a. good deal to be said with regard to the defects of that system, although I shall not trespass on your Lordships' time to-day by going further into that matter. Then we see great powers given to our local bodies. Those bodies by their very constitution are open to be used, and are used by Parliament, for the administration of all those Acts which the demands for social reform create almost every day. But in putting these new duties on to local bodies the Government exercise no official supervision. I have been told that the President of the Local Government Board has kept a somewhat restraining hand recently on the borrowing powers of some of these local authorities. That may or may not be true, but I am quite sure of one thing&#x2014;that he has not protected those same local authorities from the extravagant demands which have been put upon them by Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00354">The Imperial taxpayer is in a very different position. He can resent to some extent the imposition of new taxes. He can make his voice heard to some extent in the Houses of Parliament, and, if he is
<col>124</col>
of an optimistic nature, he may even look to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to protect his interests. But the difference in the attitude of Parliament towards local as compared with imperial expenditure is shown, I think, in a small but very significant manner, in the form in which Bills are presented. Bills which create new charges on Imperial funds can only be brought forward in the House of Commons by a Minister of the Crown. A private Member is not allowed to suggest the imposition of new taxation. Formerly when a Bill was printed the taxation proposals were left blank, and now they are printed in italics until the necessary Motion has been brought forward by a responsible Minister and carried. There is no such safeguard as regards the ratepayer. His pocket is open to he picked by anybody who chooses to suggest fresh legislation the result of which will be to increase the rates. In fact, local finance has been regarded with indifference by Parliament, and the result is to be seen, not only in the present injustice of the incidence of rates, but also in the alarming increase in our local expenditure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00355">Speaking on this subject in the House of Commons in 1881, Mr. Gladstone said&#x2014;
<quote>"What we have to do is to strive honestly and impartially to keep down the aggregate total expenditure of the country, whether it be local expenditure or Imperial expenditure. That is the interest and that is the duty of Parliament."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00356">That remark was made in the course of a debate on a proposal that just as an annual Budget is prepared for the Imperial Exchequer of the country, so the House of Commons should devote some portion of its time to the consideration of a Budget relating to the local finances of the country. I do not wish to unduly weary you with masses of figures. I know that the mere recital of figures is apt to be far from impressive, especially when, as is so often the case nowadays in speaking of public expenditure, those figures amount to many millions. But I would like to remind your Lordships that the present local expenditure in the United Kingdom exceeds &#x00A3;160,000,000 a year, and, as your Lordships know, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is budgeting for an Imperial expenditure of about &#x00A3;170,000,000 this year. It is true that some part of that Imperial expenditure in the Budget will go to relieve the amount which has to be found. by the rate
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0067"/>
<col>125</col>
payers. but taking local and Imperial expenditure together we are now paying for the public administration of this country considerably over &#x00A3;300,000,000 a year; or, if I may put it in another way, it is costing us not far short of &#x00A3;1,000,000 every day to run the public business of this country; and if the life of the present Government be unduly prolonged, I have no doubt that it will take &#x00A3;2,000,000 a day to run our public business, and that every other man in the United Kingdom will be employed by the State in carrying out its administration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00357">In the face of these facts it may be said that it does not matter whether the money comes out of the pockets of the ratepayers or out of the pockets of the taxpayers. If the basis of taxation were the same or even similar for local as for Imperial expenditure, that might be the case; but the incidence of local and Imperial charges is by no means the same, and the importance of the financial relations of the central Government to the local authorities is of the first magnitude. In discussing this subject I should like as far as possible to avoid going over old ground, but perhaps your Lordships will allow me to go back a little way and recall to the House that prior to 1888 the Parliamentary grants which were annually voted in aid of the rates were appropriated to specific services and bore some relation to the expenditure on those services. But in 1888 a great change took place. This was in the substitution of the system of assigned revenues for that of grants in aid, and at the same time most of the direct grants were abolished or else were paid out of the proceeds of the assigned revenues. In assigning these revenues they allocated to the local authorities the produce of certain licences and one-half of the Probate Duty. This was done with a view to broadening the basis of local taxation for national purposes, and with a view of making the owners of personalty pay towards local charges. But it is not clear on what principle these revenues were assigned, for if there had been any distinction drawn between national and local services those revenues would have shown it in the sources from which they were drawn. But in any case, whatever principle these revenues were assigned on, and whatever distinction, if any, was drawn between these services, it has been entirely lost sight of in all the changes
<col>126</col>
that have since taken place. Acts have been passed and changes have been made which show that the present system of assigned revenues is regarded by the Treasury merely as a measure of relief from the Imperial Exchequer to local funds.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00358">It is true that these assigned revenues have been enlarged since 1888. They have been enlarged from two sources. First, under the Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1890; and, secondly, under the Licensing Act of 1904. But putting aside the Parliamentary grants which were given in aid of elementary education, we find that the Education Acts of 1902 and 1903 have swept away all the relief which was afforded under the first of these sources by earmarking that revenue to go towards meeting the increased cost of higher education which was thrown on the local authorities by those two Education Acts. We also find that the recent Finance Act has swept away the relief which was afforded under the second of those sources by allocating the revenue obtainable from the monopoly value of new licences to the Imperial Exchequer. But apart from the effect of these two Acts, as a measure of relief the system of assigned revenues has failed. It was no doubt contemplated under the original scheme that the resources of local authorities would be automatically increased in order to correspond with the growth of the charges thereon which have to be met. No doubt it was thought that the yield of the assigned revenues would augment as years went on. It is true that the increase in revenue was fairly steady from the year 1888 to the time of the Report of the Royal Commission in 1901; but since that date this has been by no means the case. The total amount drawn from the Local Taxation Account in the United Kingdom has dropped from &#x00A3;11,150,000 in 1908 to &#x00A3;9,820,000 in 1909, and there is a further decrease to &#x00A3;9,445,000 in the year ended March 31, 1910. That is a drop of nearly &#x00A3;2,000,000 within the last two years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00359">The unfavourable position in which local authorities now find themselves is largely due to the alterations in the law which have taken place since the passing of the Local Government Act, 1888, alterations which have not only greatly complicated the system but which have also had the effect of reducing the amounts
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0068"/>
<col>127</col>
available for distribution amongst the various local authorities. Year by year Parliament passes Statutes imposing new duties and new charges upon local authorities. The object, no doubt, of these Acts is excellent, and the arguments by which they are supported are very strong; but the action of Parliament in this matter really amounts to nothing less than adopting an attitude of generous benevolence at the expense, not of Parliament, but of the ratepayers. I think harsh words would be used of the public philanthropist who practised his philanthropy by putting his hands, not into his own pockets, but into the pockets of his neighbours; yet that is the course which has been adopted by both Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00360">I do not propose to deal in detail with all the Parliamentary delinquencies of this nature. I think the catalogue would be so long as to be absolutely wearisome. But I would venture to point out to your Lordships one or two instances of the kind of generosity to which I have referred. Under the Police Act of 1890 police authorities were compelled by Parliament to grant pensions to members of the police force. Part of this pension fund was found by the police force and a portion of it came out of the Imperial Exchequer; but the balance came out of the pockets of the ratepayers. I am sure that nobody will grudge the granting of pensions to such an excellent body of public servants as the police admittedly are; but the police service is a national one, not a local one; yet the greater part of the cost of the upkeep of this service falls upon local and not upon Imperial funds. Then within the last few days Parliament has had before it the Police (Weekly Rest-day) Bill, again an excellent Bill with most excellent objects, but its objects cannot be carried out without increasing the cost; and while Parliament has been giving this well-deserved privilege to the police force, the Government have refused to defray any part of the cost, which will now fall upon the local authorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00361">Then recent Finance Acts have not proved by any means mines of wealth to local authorities whatever they may be to the Imperial Exchequer. The Budget of 1908 transferred from the Government to the local authorities the collection of the establishment and dog licence duties; but with an appearance of great generosity the Chancellor of the Exchequer allocated a sum
<col>128</col>
of &#x00A3;40,000 to be divided up amongst local authorities in order to reimburse them for the extra cost of getting in these duties. In order to gauge the extent of this generosity one can remark that London's share of this grant only amounts to &#x00A3;4,000, while the cost last year to the London County Council of carrying out this new duty amounted to &#x00A3;12,000, or just three times the amount of the grant allocated; and no doubt in future years this cost will increase.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00362">I have already made some criticism as to the effect of the Finance Act of 1909&#x2013;10 on local funds, but I should like to say a few words in regard to the effect of the new Land Taxes which are imposed under that Act. When the Budget of last year was introduced with its proposals for the further taxation of land it contained no provision for helping local authorities out of that new taxation. Criticism was quickly offered on behalf of local authorities, many of whom, I think most of whom, had regarded this form of taxation as offering a possible future source of revenue for local purposes. Certainly in urban communities they regarded land values as a subject which they were in the future going to draw upon. I do not wish to discuss the vexed question of the justice or otherwise of the policy of taxation of land values. I would merely remark that prior to the passing of this Act most of the advocates of that policy had regarded it merely as a fund for local purposes. However, during the discussions which followed the introduction of this Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer incidentally announced his intention of allocating one-half of the proceeds of the new land duties to the local authorities. No doubt Mr. Lloyd George thought that in allocating one-half of a tax which is regarded as being derived from a purely local source, he could in justice say that half a loaf was better than no bread, and that the local authorities would accept it. I am not at all certain that the local authorities are satisfied that half a tax is better than or equal to getting the whole tax. However, their opinion has not been asked, and they have to content themselves with the crumbs which fall from the table of the Imperial Treasury. The distribution of those crumbs has been long in suspense, but apparently from the recent Budget statement this new revenue&#x2014;the local authorities' share of the Land Taxes&#x2014;is merely going to replace the disappearing spirit duties. In
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0069"/>
<col>129</col>
other words, the decreased consumption of spirits has affected local revenue to the extent of &#x00A3;328,000, and this is now going to be made up by a grant out of Imperial funds, which is to include the local authorities' share of the yield of the Land Taxes. But when this revenue was allocated in the first place to local authorities, the gift was regarded as a spontaneous one, but apparently under these new proposals it is merely going to make up for a deficiency in Imperial revenue, for which local authorities are in no way to blame.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00363">To enter even superficially into the relations between the Imperial Exchequer and the local authorities all over the country would be a work of considerable magnitude. I therefore propose to deal more specifically with the claims of London, and to leave the grievances of other local authorities to those of your Lordships who are better qualified to speak upon them. London has certain claims which are not shared by other local authorities. In the first place, her share of the assigned revenues, which were allocated to London on the basis of the discontinued grants in 1888, was unfair. These revenues were distributed among the various local authorities in proportion to the grants which they were receiving in the year 1887&#x2013;8. But this basis of apportionment was not only unsatisfactory in its working, but distinctly unfair to London. In the first place, these grants did not at the time meet the requirements of London as compared to other localities. In the second place, this basis was on the grants of a. single year instead of being taken on an average of several years. Thirdly, no provision was made to meet the increased cost of the growth and the development of London and its suburbs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00364">Then as to the revenue which is paid to the local authorities from the duties on licensed premises, which are, of course, the most remunerative of all licences, London is again at a distinct disadvantage. The average size of the public-houses and licensed premises in London is much greater than in the rest of the country, but the graduation of the duty on licensed premises ceased at &#x00A3;700, and public-houses of an annual value of &#x00A3;1,000, &#x00A3;2,000, and upwards paid exactly the same as if they were only worth &#x00A3;700. Therefore it is evident that the yield from this duty is far less in proportion to the annual value of its public-houses in London than in the provinces. The average annual value of the public
<col>130</col>
houses in London is over three times as great as the average in the country generally, and the proportion that the Licence Duty bears to the annual value of these houses in London is less than half what it is in the rest of the country. Under the recent Finance Act of 1909&#x2013;10 the limitation of the graduation of the duty on licensed premises has been removed, but the extra revenue which will be derived owing to the removal of the limitation of this graduation has been assigned to the Imperial Exchequer. Therefore, the position of the London ratepayer is exactly the same. In fact, according to a recent legal decision the effect of the Finance Act will merely be to reduce: the assessable value of licensed premises,</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00365">London has, in fact, special claims on the sympathy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Her share of the Imperial contribution bears a much smaller proportion to the burden of local taxation than elsewhere. If we compare London in this respect with any of the county boroughs we find that in London, out of the heavy rates per &#x00A3; necessarily levied, only 1s. 3&#x00BC;d. is contributed by the Imperial Exchequer; Birmingham gets 2s. ld.; Leeds gets 2s. 4&#x00BD;d.; Sheffield gets 2s. 10d. In fact, if you take the ten county boroughs having the largest assessable value you will find they all compare most. favourably with London in this respect, their share of Imperial contributions bearing a much larger proportion of their burden of local taxation. But perhaps the most serious aspect of this problem is the fact that new services of a national character, as I have already pointed out, and new developments in the administration of existing services, are constantly being thrown by Parliament on local authorities. One of these services, which I have not yet alluded to, and a very important one, is education. New orders are constantly being evolved by Parliament necessitating very heavy expenditure by local education authorities. According to a return presented to the London County Council last March the extra net expenditure thrown on the council under Acts coming into force since 1904 amounted in the one year&#x2014;that is, in the previous year&#x2014;to over &#x00A3;450,000. Expenditure upon education is no doubt in a sense remunerative outlay. It equips us in an international struggle for trade and it should lead to better conditions of living; and if the increase in our expenditure upon education bore any proportion to the increase
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0070"/>
<col>131</col>
in the growth of our population, nobody would question the wisdom of this outlay. The objects of such recent Acts as the Act of 1907 for the medical inspection of children in our public elementary schools, and the Act of 1906 for giving meals to necessitous children, command the sympathy of all classes, although in regard to the last-mentioned Act it must result in a diminution of the number of self-supporting families in this country, and must throw an ever-increasing burden on those families who do support themselves and who support the State as well. In may interest your Lordships in regard to this Act to know that about two years ago the Berlin Municipal Council decided to discontinue giving meals through the education department of the council, and transferred the whole matter to the Poor Law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00366">But, my Lords, what I really object to, and what I think every ratepayer ought to object to, are the methods by which such Acts as these are passed by Parliament without any reference or any consideration being given to their financial results, while their cost and their administration is thrown in a light-hearted manner upon the local authorities without any increase, or any relative increase, of the Government grant. This piecemeal, haphazard sort of legislation has already produced chaos in local government. In some of the poorer districts in the country it has produced what in an ordinary business concern would be regarded as a condition of bankruptcy, as I am sure the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland will admit when he recalls the fact that in some districts in Scotland the rates already amount to 20s. in the &#x00A3; We must also remember that the full effect of many of these Acts has yet to be felt. At the present moment we have approximately about three-quarters of a million of children in our public elementary schools in London alone. I think one might anticipate the very heavy charge which will have to be met at some future date&#x2014;say, in twenty years&#x2014;in carrying out the provisions of an Act such as the Act I have just mentioned &#x2014;for the medical inspection of these children. The Act, it is true, only compelled the inspection of children, but it gave powers to defray the cost of their medical treatment, and it has very necessarily led to provision being made for their medical treatment. None of your Lordships would like to go to your doctor and
<col>132</col>
have your ailments diagnosed if no suggestion was made as to the provision of the necessary remedies, which in the position of these children you would be unable to pay for. Therefore, I think the London County Council were bound to pursue the course of making provision for the medical treatment of these poor children.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00367">I have dealt at some length with education because it is one of the most important and the most expensive of the national services. It has been recognised to be distinctly a national service, towards the cost of which a part of the national revenue has been assigned. Now owing to the action of Parliament&#x2014;I refer to the recent Finance Act&#x2014;a great shortage in this revenue has taken place. In this case the Government, for the purpose of making up a deficiency in national revenue, are appropriating to the Imperial Exchequer part of the income which had been allocated to the local authorities. They are, in fact, robbing Peter to pay Paul. I think this is an argument against assigning revenues to local authorities from subjects which are also taxed for Imperial purposes, and which, therefore, must to some extent be indirectly affected by every Finance Bill passed by Parliament. The great evil of the present system really is that there is no proportion between the variation in the produce of the assigned revenues and the variation in the expenditure on national services. The expenditure on these services is always varying in an upward direction; the produce of the assigned revenues is also always varying, but frequently in a downward direction. There is no line of demarcation to show the relative responsibility which should be borne by the Imperial and local taxpayer for these services.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00368">It is now nine years since the Royal Commission on Local Taxation issued their Report. Whatever difference of opinion may be shown by the Majority and the Minority Reports, they were unanimous in recognising the evils which exist, and they both recommended a complete revision of the system of Imperial subventions and increased aid towards local taxation. In saying this I do not wish to make any attack on the Party at present in power. The Prime Minister has expressed sympathy with the grievances of the ratepayers, and we have Mr. Lloyd George's opinion that whatever Party is in power will have to deal with this ques
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0071"/>
<col>133</col>
tion next year. I therefore think that we might hope, now that the Poor Law Commission has reported making recommendations of a very important character in regard to at least one branch of this subject, that some settlement might not be long delayed. As a member of the London County Council, the position of that body in relation to London ratepayers naturally presents itself to me most urgently. Rates within the London area undoubtedly bear very heavily on London industries, and London, as I have ventured to point out, is distinctly unfairly treated by the imperial Exchequer. I need not remind your Lordships that to thousands, I might almost say to millions, of the inhabitants of London every penny added to the rates which they are called upon to pay is of very serious importance. The London County Council have made out an unanswerable case for fairer treatment by the Imperial Exchequer, and while I sincerely hope that nothing will prevent the whole question being dealt with not later than next year, as indicated by Mr. Lloyd George, I would put in a plea, if it should unhappily be found impossible to deal with the whole question of local taxation next year, that in no circumstances should the favourable consideration of the exceptional position of London be further deferred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00369">I am afraid 1 have trespassed unduly on your Lordships' time, but I do not intend to offer any suggestions as to the solution of this most difficult question. I might, perhaps, say that it seems to me that increased. Imperial subventions can only temporarily alleviate the position of the ratepayer. Increased grants are apt to lead to increased expenditure on the part of spending bodies, and although I think it is absolutely necessary that the Government should do very much more towards the cost of these national services which they are insisting upon the local authorities carrying out, I think it will not be a complete remedy unless the system of levying rates is so altered as to bring home to every ratepayer the responsibility of his vote. In view, however, of the discussions which must arise when this question of the readjustment of local and Imperial finance comes under the consideration of Parliament, I venture to think that the Return for which I ask, giving particulars of the position in foreign countries and in British Dominions, will not be without some value. I therefore hope that His Majesty's Govern

ment may see their way to grant this Return.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00371"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for intervening so early in the debate, but I am, unfortunately, called away from the House, and I desire merely to make one or two general observations, leaving the specific points raised by the noble Earl to be more fully dealt with by others. But I am glad to take the opportunity of expressing a view which I am sure is shared by all members of your Lordships' House who are present&#x2014;of congratulating the noble Earl upon the clearness and lucidity with which he has dealt with this most complex subject. The noble Earl touched upon certain controversial matters, and I do not profess to find myself in complete agreement with everything he said; yet at the same time he expressed his views throughout with marked moderation.<lb/>
It appears to me that in lamenting, as we all do lament from time to time, the growth of national and of local expenditure, we must be careful to draw a line between expenditure which can be in any degree described as extravagant and that which is necessary and in some cases even remunerative. It is a distinction which is not always quite fairly drawn. For instance, in dealing with the expenditure of local authorities it surely is necessary, although different views may be held as to the desirability of local authorities undertaking certain local services, to differentiate between expenditure which can be at all fairly described as extravagant and expenditure upon water supply, upon lighting, and upon different forms of traction, which cannot be classified, of course, as expenditure out of pocket. On the general question the noble Earl seemed to lament our extravagance and to expect a higher measure of economy from noble Lords opposite if they were to sit on these Benches. It is not for me to foretell what might happen when noble Lords opposite return to office; but in the meantime I might remind the noble Earl that his friends are perpetually pressing upon us, urging upon us, increased expenditure in a great many branches, not merely
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0072"/>
<col>135</col>
as regards the defence of the country, but also as regards those measures of social reform upon which we are accused of having spent so much.<lb/>
This subject, as I have said, is one of the most extreme complexity and difficulty. The noble Lord drew a distinction which we have all been accustomed to draw at any rate ever since the publication of the Report of the Committee on which the noble Lord, Lord Balfour, sat&#x2014;the distinction between local and national services; and he instanced the ease of education. Education might, I suppose, in one sense be spoken of as a purely national service, but, on the other hand, it is, of course, a commonplace to observe that if that particular service is to be paid for by national funds it must be conducted under national management. If you deliberately choose to hand over to the local authorities a very large share in the administration of our elementary education system and our secondary education system as well, it follows, as a necessary corollary, that at any rate a considerable part of the expenditure must be found from local funds. I confess I was a little surprised to hear the police service spoken of so confidently by the noble Earl as being purely a national service. That is a view I should myself hesitate to take. I should have thought that the provision of local police might be compared not unfairly with local services such as lighting and others of a kindred character.<lb/>
The noble Earl complained of us in one respect with regard to the allocation made under the new system of finance, of the Land Taxes to local authorities. He stated that so far as the Land Values Duties were concerned, those had always been looked forward to by urban authorities as a possible source of revenue. When there was a question of passing legislation through this House in which the local authorities would have directly obtained some of those Land Values Duties the proposition was not favourably received by your Lordships. But on the general question I should like to say this, that the more one looks into the question the more one sees that the increment arising from what are known as urban land values cannot properly be set down in its entirety to the exertions of the particular locality. It really is not the case, in the case of such towns, say, as Glasgow, Bristol, or Manchester, that the whole of the increment
<col>136</col>
described under the name of land values is due, although, of course, a great part of it is, to the exertions of those who live in the immediate locality. Those who trade with the locality undoubtedly contribute their share towards that increment. On this particular point I should like to add that, even though the local authorities may have been disappointed in this particular instance, yet they have got their share of such duties as the Reversion Duties and of the Mineral Rights Duty, which I imagine never entered into their most hopeful dreams. Therefore if they have lost anything over the Land Values Duty they have gained on these other taxes. I think I might remind the noble Earl and the House that, in addition to those contributions, the Development Grant and the institution of the Road Board are all steps towards relieving the local authorities to some considerable extent from duties which otherwise might, in part, at any rate, have fallen upon them.<lb/>
But my real reason for rising at this moment was to give the noble Earl the categorical assurance for which he asks. I can say quite definitely that if we find ourselves next year in the position of advising the Crown we shall make an attempt to deal with the whole of this subject. The noble Earl can take it from me that that is so. Of course, whether it might be possible to conclude the whole subject during the compass of a single session, I cannot say, but we shall certainly make the attempt; and we are now proceeding to gain information and to consider the methods by which the whole subject&#x2014;one of enormous difficulty, I once more repeat&#x2014;may be brought before the country in what I hope may prove to be a satisfactory form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00372"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no intention of occupying the time of the House at any length. I have so repeatedly had to bring forward questions with regard to the incidence of local and Imperial taxation and the hardship of national services being put upon the rates, that it would be almost an insult to your Lordships if I were to repeat on this occasion what I have so often reiterated. I rise in the first place to thank my noble friend for his very clear and admirable statement with regard to the whole of the local affairs with which he dealt. I have some experience of local affairs myself, and nobody knows better than I do the great compli
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0073"/>
<col>137</col>
cation and difficulty of describing accurately to gentlemen who are not so well informed as my noble friend is the actual state of the case. I listened with the greatest interest to the noble Earl's remarks, and I certainly think he gave the House a clear exposition of the actual state of affairs.<lb/>
Let me say at once that when the noble Earl claimed that national services should be paid for out of national funds, he made no unfair claim. It is perfectly true, as the noble Earl the Leader of the House mentioned, that in a question like education a considerable part of the cost naturally must be paid by those who have to administer the work locally. The whole principle of local taxation is that some part, at all events, must be paid locally, and it would not be either fair or desirable that the whole of the funds should be found out of Imperial taxation. But in connection with education an enormous increase has been put on local sources since the earlier days to which the noble Earl referred&#x2014;1889, 1894, and 1895. A return which I have in my hand shows that the increase in the amount raised locally, as compared with the earlier year 1889, was, in the year 1906&#x2013;7,248 per cent. Large funds have, of course, been raised out of the Imperial Exchequer for this purpose, but the amount charged against local taxation has increased beyond all bounds.<lb/>
As to the general points referred to by my noble friend, there was one which I am sure we shall cordially support. He protested, as I and many of my noble friends in this House have done, against Acts being passed through Parliament without any consideration of the cost thrown on the rates. I am glad the noble Earl again laid particular stress on that point, because it is one on which I do not think too much stress can be laid. You admit that the incidence of local taxation is inequitable and unfair, but the moment you have to find money for a particular purpose you accentuate the inequity and unfairness by putting the whole of the cost on local taxation.<lb/>
There was one other point in my noble friend's speech to which I wish to refer&#x2014;namely, as to the proportion, when we are going to get anything out of the Imperial Exchequer, which might be due to the different branches of local taxation. The
<col>138</col>
noble Lord naturally thought that London had a larger claim than other parts of the country. I read in a newspaper the other day a statement with regard to county boroughs, in which the claim was made that they ought to have a much larger share than others; and, no doubt, if one went into the country one would find the country ratepayer making the same contention I have no wish to say anything about the contest as to what proportions we should get when we get anything at all. But at all events we must all join in trying to make some impression on those who have the administration of the affairs of the country, and I was happy to hear that the noble Earl, in the latter part of his speech, gave an assurance that if possible this question would be tackled within twelve months.<lb/>
A deputation from the County Councils Association a few days ago went to see the Chancellor of the Exchequer, fortified with figures which we thought conclusive and which we had already sent to the right hon. gentleman. On behalf of the deputation I made some remarks with regard to the incidence of local taxation and the great grievances under which we suffered. I had not spoken for more than a very few moments when I was stopped by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said he cordially agreed in everything we put forward. He said that he was perfectly aware that the inequity of the present system was very great indeed, that he was conversant with all matters of local government, especially with regard to the county councils, and that all he wanted to be convinced of now was, not that some money should be given towards the relief of the rates, but how that could best be done. The right hon. gentleman admitted that it was a large question, and said that if it was to be taken up in a complete way it would require a very large sum of money; and he regretted that he was obliged to say that a farthing given here or a halfpenny given there would be of very little use. I am glad to know that he thinks the question is so important that it ought to be brought forward within the next year. But at the same time a starving man is not altogether reluctant to have a crust of bread given to him, even though he sees a very good bill of fare in front of him which he may be able to enjoy at some future date. We had a good deal of discussion at the deputation,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0074"/>
<col>139</col>
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer concluded his remarks by appealing to the gentlemen from the County Councils Association that they should go into this matter and make some suggestion to him at a future date with regard to the way that this large sum of money should be found. That, to my mind, marks a distinct step on the part of the Government.<lb/>
If the Motion of my noble friend is carried, I should venture to suggest the addition of certain words. The Motion reads&#x2014;
<quote>"To move for a Return giving particulars of the financial relations in the principal foreign countries and in British possessions between the central and the local governments."</quote>
I would like added to that the words&#x2014;
<quote>"and of the methods by which funds are raised in such countries for the purpose of local government."</quote>
The County Councils Association are at present sitting for the purpose of considering what steps they should take with regard to the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that we should go into this question. Obviously it might be a very large inquiry, and one of the first things that it would be desirable to know is how these matters are dealt with in other countries, and how these essentially large funds are raised. Even if the noble Earl the Leader of the House is not able to give a favourable answer to the request with regard to foreign countries, I do hope that in some form or another such a Return may be furnished. It will be of great value in view of the fact that these questions are going to be discussed, not only by the Government but by other people who are interested; and I am sure the County Councils Association would be very grateful for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00373"><sup>*</sup><member>TILE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not detain your Lordships more than a couple of minutes. I should like to say that I do not think there will be any very serious improvement in these matters until the Government of the day, whoever it may be, and also the Opposition, get thoroughly into their heads that. some reforms may be extremely useful, but they simply have to be adjourned or put off altogether for the simple reason that the country cannot afford them. It is impossible not to be struck by the truth of what the noble Earl the Leader of the House said, only he confined his observation to this
<col>140</col>
House. He said that in one breath, almost, people were complaining of the high taxation and at the same time asking for further expenditure. That is no doubt what is going on all over the country. The public in general and Parliament first think that reform is very desirable, and then they set to work to find the money. In some cases that is a proper way of proceeding, for instance when providing for national defence, on which our existence depends. But when we come to other reforms we have to consider the relative merits of the case, and, I think, balance what is the best thing to do: to impose heavy taxation or go without the reform for the time being. In fact, my Lords, we have to cut our coat according to our cloth. That is a lesson which I am afraid has been entirely forgotten. The rates particularly are beginning to weigh very heavily on the people, but I am not altogether without hope, although it is useless to preach economy just now, that we may in the near future come to some more sane ideas, and be able to cut our coat according to our cloth, not only with regard to local but also with regard to Imperial taxation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00374"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we ought to be very grateful to the noble Earl the Leader of the House for the statement he has made, that the Government really intend to take up this question of the revision of local rating at the earliest possible date, probably next year. Our gratitude must depend, of course, on what the actual method of giving this relief to local rates is, keeping in view the grievance which local ratepayers complain of, and which I think is universally acknowledged. We hope that relief will be given in a method which will be satisfactory, particularly to rural and agricultural ratepayers.<lb/>
The two chief grievances of which we complain have been constantly put forward whenever this matter has been discussed. They are, first, that we are required to pay locally a very undue proportion towards the cost of those services which are partially or entirely of a national character; and, in addition, that these rates are levied on what is vaguely termed real property, and consequently the real wealth of the country is to a very large degree exempt. That is, I think, the chief injustice of the position. The basis upon which rates are levied was pointed out very fully by the Royal
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0075"/>
<col>141</col>
Commission on Local Taxation, but those grievances have been intensified since that Commission reported by the enormous increase of expenditure which has taken place since that time. Every year new duties are being placed upon local authorities, and every duty carries with it increased expenditure and consequent increased burdens upon the already hard-driven ratepayer, During the last ten or fifteen Years the subventions from Imperial 'funds have increased, but they have by no means kept pace with the enormous increase of expenditure.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, in bringing forward this Motion, dealt with the enormous sums we have to pay both for local and Imperial taxation, and with the rating for all purposes. But I should like to put before your Lordships two figures to show the increase of the particular rates for what are termed national purposes, and also the amount which we get from Imperial funds to meet them. Poor-law, police, education, and main roads are, I think, universally regarded as of a national or semi-national character. The total cost for the year 1906&#x2013;7, the last year for which we have the full returns, was &#x00A3;14,500,000. Towards that we obtained from the Imperial funds a total of &#x00A3;18,500,000, leaving &#x00A3;26,000,000 to be paid out of the local rates, a proportion which we believe to be entirely unfair. While the total cost for these particular purposes leas increased since 1889 from &#x00A3;17,000,000 to &#x00A3;14,500,000, the Imperial contribution has increased only from &#x00A3;4,000,000 to &#x00A3;18,000,000, so that we are considerably worse off than before.<lb/>
But the real significance of these figures is brought out when we can show the enormous increase in rates. In 1889 the average rate for England was 3s. 8d. in the &#x00A3;, while in 1907 it was 6s. 1d. That means an increase of over 60 per cent., although during. that time there had been a considerable increase in rateable value; but that increase in rateable value has not nearly kept pace with the increase of the amount of money we spend. The increase in the rateable value is 37 per cent., whereas the amount we spend has increased by 60 per cent. I think that shows that in some degree at all events we are living beyond our means. The Royal Commission on Local Taxation&#x2014;and I speak with some diffidence on this
<col>142</col>
point, because the noble Lord, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, who presided over that Commission, is going to follow me&#x2014;suggested, with regard to the increase of expenditure on national purposes, that an additional fixed giant should be given in aid of local authorities. The suggested amount was a large sum, something short of &#x00A3;3,000,000; and while they had a very strong case for advising that grant in the year in which they reported&#x2014;nine years ago&#x2014;the case is much stronger now. We have, as I have shown, made enormous strides in the spending of money, and the grant then proposed would be quite inadequate to meet the case at the present moment, and would be vastly inadequate, I am certain, in the near future.<lb/>
I doubt very much whether a system of fixed grants can be in any way a solution of these difficulties. I do not think they can be regarded as a satisfactory method. I am aware that a grant varying with the expenditure is open to still stronger objections, as obviously it must lead to extravagance if the local authority can put their hands into the bottomless purse of the Imperial Exchequer. But a fixed grant has an inherent objection of its own, for while it may be adequate for the immediate purpose intended in the year in which it is given, expenditure increases so rapidly that it soon becomes quite insufficient for the purpose. We see that very clearly in the grants under the Agricultural Rates Act. They were nominally one-half of the agricultural rates then paid&#x2014;I think 1s. 1d. in the &#x00A3;. At the present day that sum is not nearly one-half of the rates, and as a matter of fact the increased expenditure of local authorities has swept away from the agricultural ratepayer practically the whole advantage which that Act gave him.<lb/>
It was proposed at one time that the taxation of the country should be raised according to ability to pay; but that was a legislative proposal which I do not think was ever carried out or could be carried out in practice. It dates, I think, from the days of Queen Elizabeth, and just as a chance it has left the rates mainly to he raised on real property. In those days real property was the chief, if not the only, source of income; but since that time the centre of wealth has shifted altogether from the owners of real property, and is
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0076"/>
<col>143</col>
much more centred in the hands of the owners of personal property. While the standard of ability to pay cannot be accepted as impracticable in the working out for ordinary purposes of rating, I should like, with your Lordships' leave, to refer for one moment to the system as we now adopt it. Of Imperial taxation, for every &#x00A3;100 raised 17&#x00BD;per cent. comes from rateable property and 82&#x00BD; per cent. from other sources. Now we may presume that that is a fair system. If it is not a fair system it can be objected to from year to year. I take it that it is a fair division, and one which fairly shows the different classes of rating. But in local rating the position is almost entirely reversed. From figures calculated in 1901, which probably are not seriously different now, out of every &#x00A3;100 raised for local rating, 71 per cent. was raised from rateable property and only 29 per cent. from other sources. If the ability to pay as taken from the standard of Imperial taxation is correct, the figures I have given for local rating show that real property for those rates is paying a sum three or four times greater than it is entitled to do. I think that shows that a real grievance exists in the matter, and that there is good ground for some change.<lb/>
I do not know what solution may be in the mind of the Government when they come to deal with this question, but I do think that the system of grants in aid from the Exchequer are unsatisfactory, whether they are in the form of fixed grants or of varying grants. The only solution which I think has been put forward&#x2014;I am not quite certain whether it was supported by the Royal Commission or not&#x2014;is that the Government should take over the expenditure, and with that expenditure the whole or a large part of the local control of a great many of these national duties. They have done so already, I think, in the case of prisons with a perfectly satisfactory result, and I do not see why the same process should not be applied to other national duties, such as the care of lunatics, the cost of the indoor poor, the police, reformatories and industrial schools, and other things. I do not believe it will be possible to take over the control entirely of education or of main roads, but I do believe that they might take over a very much greater control of these things than is done at present, and 1 do not think
<col>144</col>
any strong objection would be raised to their doing so if we got equivalent relief from rates. There can be no doubt, from what has been said on this subject in this House and in the country, that the question of relief of local rates is really a burning one, and we do look to the Government to go closely into the matter and endeavour as far as possible to arrive at a solution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00375"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this debate has opened a very large question and has ranged over very wide ground, and it would be quite impossible in an evening's debate to touch upon all the questions raised. The noble Earl who opened the debate, though the peg on which his speech hangs is a Motion for foreign returns, allowed the bulk of his speech to have reference to the one case of London. I do not think that the House is so much interested in London as in the general question of the relation between rates and taxes. But I will say this to the noble Earl, that I think he is perfectly right in saying that London has been very badly treated in the distribution of Parliamentary aid in the relief of local obligations.<lb/>
I would like to mention the operation of the Education Act of 1902. There was then an aid grant which was intended to work up to nearly, but not exceeding, 10s.per child. Owing, however, to the extremely intricate adjustment by which that grant was to be distributed, and which I will undertake not one person in this House could repeat correctly, and very few could remember approximately, London, though spending more per head on the education of its children than any other locality, was receiving nearer 6s. than 7s. per child. 'I he bulk of the country was receiving nearly 10s. a child; that is to say, the local authority, which showed the greatest willingness to conduct the education of its children on a liberal scale received a very much smaller grant <i>per capita</i> than those who were not so generous. I entirely sympathise with those interested in London government who protest against that unfair treatment. I am glad to see that the London County Council are congratulating themselves on the expectation of receiving very soon &#x00A3;200,000 a year from the operation of the Budget. They are the more pleased to welcome that accession of income inasmuch as in their pamphlets and documents which helped them to win the elec
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0077"/>
<col>145</col>
tion they put it as a probable result of this tax that something, like only &#x00A3;30,000 would be raised from the whole country. At any rate, they must be happy that their prophecies have proved wrong in that respect.<lb/>
The debate has travelled to-night to the general question of the incidence and the proper burden of rates. I think people are too much in the habit of getting hold of a phrase and thinking that it is an argument. They say that services which are national ought to be paid for from national funds. Then comes the minor premise, "This, that, and the other services we perform are national"; and the conclusion that follows is "Those services should be paid for from national funds." There is not any service rendered in this country which cannot be looked at from the national and also from the local point of view, and I do not think you get any further by using that phrase. The essence of the question of where the burden of rates should fall is, Who has the right of directing and determining the scale of the expenditure? Take education, for instance. Local authorities have wide discretion. They may settle the scale of salaries to the teachers and the class of teacher they employ; they may decide to employ a highly qualified teacher, or they may decide to employ a less qualified teacher; and it is clear if they settle the scale high or low they use their own discretion. If you had a Government system I am afraid the standard of education in the better districts would be very materially reduced, because the Government would not take upon itself the burden of conforming to the liberal idea of education that is at present carried cut in the better districts. I tremble for what would happen in Scotland, with their liberal ideas of elementary and general education, if they were subject to a rigorous Treasury which would cut them down to the standard which has satisfied a backward English county. I think you must let the people who settle the policy be responsible for the substantial payment. I do not mind the grants being Parliamentary ones if they do not injure the principle of local self-government, but I agree with the noble Lord who has just spoken that there is great mischief in subventions. Either the people think it is not money which they are paying and therefore it encourages extravagance, or it brings with it an excess of Governmental interference. I am not desirous of Governmental inter
<col>146</col>
ference from Whitehall in our local self-government. I believe in trusting largely to the local authorities, and I think every time you come to the Treasury you put a fetter upon yourselves. So much for the question of national services and national aid. I say that the test is local management and local financial responsibility, and I am not anxious to diminish the initiative and freedom of local government.<lb/>
In these debates we are apt to drift into a conflict between urban and rural authorities. The noble Lord who spoke last touched on the operation of the Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act. It is perfectly true that while the Government relieved in perpetuity all agricultural land from the obligation of being rated beyond one-half its value, that was a permanent concession given to agricultural land by the ratepayer; that is to say, the ratepayer occupying houses, and railway companies and other business enterprises, had to bear the whole burden of any increase of the rate. The Government subsidy was calculated upon the then rates falling upon different classes of property. Since then we know that of the various services which have been called into existence the heaviest of all the burdens in rural districts has been the Education Act of 1902. I think I am speaking within the mark when I say that that Act has imposed from a sixpenny to a nine-penny rate throughout the country. That has been practically an entirely new rate. The effect of the Agricultural Rates Act has been to charge the house occupier, and, as I said, industrial enterprises, such as railways, docks, canals and mines, which, though connected with the land and therefore rated, are industries, with the burden of all the increase of cost. That, I think, works very hardly. I agree with the speaker who said that we ought, if we can, to consider the ability of the person who pays the rate or the tax to bear the burden. In my opinion if any person has a claim to alleviation from the burden of the rates it is the small occupier of a house&#x2014;the working man. Every one in this House will agree that the real burden of the rate upon agricultural land does not fall upon the occupier; it falls upon the owner. We all agree, of course, that a farmer taking a farm asks as his first question whether the rates are high or low, and he puts the rate and the rent together as one sum that he will have to bear if he takes the farm. I may say, in passing, that the burden of the rates on the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0078"/>
<col>147</col>
farmer is very greatly exaggerated. I have worked it out very carefully, and I undertake to say that on the whole turnover of the agricultural interest in the United Kingdom the rate is not three per cent. of the whole cost of production of the agriculture of the country. It is really quite an infinitesimal quantity.<lb/>
The noble Lord made one great omission in his speech. Whether the fact was not present to his mind, or whether he had not elaborated his figures, I do not know. But any one who talks of rates in this country makes the greatest mistake if he does not sever the rates in the rural districts from urban rates. The great increase that has taken place in the rates has been in the urban areas. A large amount of those rates represents expenditure in populous districts for great social improvements, sanitation, better paving, lighting, clearing of slums, and so on. Of course, even in rural districts sanitation, proper water supply for villages, and all that kind of thing, have made demands; but we know that the great increase of rates has come about generally in urban districts. Another thing you must bear in mind is that the burden of the rate on agricultural land is in substance a charge upon property and not upon industry. When you talk about shifting conditions you must recollect that it is right that property the value of which has increased largely with the industry and prosperity of this country should bear a large share of taxation for local purposes.<lb/>
But the burden on industry is another thing, and if we are to legislate in the way of the relief of rates we ought to legislate in such a way as to relieve the pressure of the burden on the small people&#x2014;the resident occupiers, the cottagers, the small shopkeepers, and other people of the kind who do feel the burden of the rates. I agree that even here there is a great difference between the apparent and immediate incidence and the ultimate incidence of the rate. It is perfectly clear that a Bond-street shopkeeper who pays a very high rent and a very high rate does not pay that rent and rate himself. He would not take a shop in Bond-street unless he knew that he would there find a class of customer to deal with him at prices which cover the high cost of the rent and the rates of his house. therefore in talking of these things you never can put your finger exactly on the spot where the burden ceases or on the man who pays it.
<col>148</col>
We are all of us trying to pass our burdens on to our neighbours; some succeed, and some fail; but he would be a hold man who could say that he could point to the first bearer who had succeeded in passing it on. When we talk of the great increase of the rates we must bear in mind that that increase has been much more urban than rural. All these questions are of the greatest difficulty and the greatest complexity, and if the Government intend to deal with them next session, I think they will need to have a session equal in duration to that of last year and consider no other business at all, for the questions raised will touch the Poor-law and go to the root of the whole of our social life. It will not be enough to give time only; it will be necessary to give a great deal of knowledge and thought also to the matter.<lb/>
I have some sympathy with the noble Earl who spoke from the Cross Benches (Lord Cromer) who said we were apt to rush cheerfully into expenditure before we knew where we should find the money to meet it, and I was struck with what was said by the noble Earl who introduced this debate, by the noble Lord who represents the county councils, and by others. They spoke with censure of Parliament passing Bills involving great additional burdens on the rates without considering where the money was to come from. But, my Lords, I have recently seen these various Bills go through&#x2014;Bills for police superannuation on a higher scale, for a police weekly day of rest, and all that, one of them moved, I think, from the opposite Benches and passed without a word; and I venture to say that although your Lordships have no control over finance, still you have control over legislation, and I have not heard a word of objection from the other side when these Bills putting burdens on the rates have been brought in, or any Motion that the Bill be read this day six months.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00377"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is perfectly right, but I am afraid he met with no response. As I say, the greatest burden thrown on the rates in the last few years was the burden imposed by the Education Act of 1902. The noble Lord and his friends rushed joyfully into that expenditure, and when they went down to their
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0079"/>
<col>149</col>
counties they were equally delighted to give the benefit of a large public expenditure to their friends of the Voluntary schools. You must not, therefore, complain so much now when you have been parties to the policy. I dare say some of you in your hearts do not like this policy of liberal expenditure for public objects, but the misfortune is that at the present day you dare not say openly that you dislike it. These things are popular, and it is very difficult to get any politician, on whatever side of the House he may be, to take up a strong opposition to a thing which he believes is popular. You will offend the constitutents of your relatives or your friends whom you want to get into the other House, and so you all run away. You say, "Let us associate ourselves together and not raise our voices in opposition to this expenditure." One or two noble Lords do, but they cry in the wilderness.<lb/>
We are going to end this debate with a Motion for Papers which I suppose will be granted. May I say I do not think these Papers will be of any use to us? I can quite understand carefully-prepared tables of finance being of use, even from other countries, but the finance of other countries is so different that unless you go into it more deeply then any Parliamentary Paper will do you will get nothing of great profit. In Germany the local authorities get a share of the Income Tax. Whatever Income Tax is put on by the central Government, so many pennies in the pound are added, up to a certain point, for local expenditure. In America you will find that practically the whole cost of education is borne locally. In Germany, again, the bulk of the cost of elementary education is born locally. All these things are so different and require so much knowledge that really you ought to get a Royal Commission of the most dispassionate, statistically-minded, and well-informed people before you could get a Report which would be of much use. Probably the newspapers would do it better than any Government, because the newspapers pitch into one another. If one newspaper misrepresents the facts on one side, the other side will show it up; and I think from the public Press you might elaborate something useful out of the criticisms passed week by week. But I do not think this Return will do a bit of good. Still, you can turn the Government statisticians on and they will give you what you want.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00382"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I was going to say that there has been no speech in the debate which dealt with so wide a variety of subjects or more widened the area of discussion than the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down. I would like, before I go further, to associate myself with the compliment paid to the noble Earl who introduced this subject. I think any one who listened to his speech must have realised that, so far as regards the part he took up, he had thoroughly studied it and learnt his case. It seemed to me to be an extremely cogent case on the point with which he chiefly dealt.<lb/>
No one knows better than I do how very large and complicated a subject this is. Before I sit down I shall touch on one aspect of it and venture to hope that I shall make at least one practical suggestion. But, as I say, it is a very complicated subject, and, as the noble Lord who just sat down said, it is a subject which cannot be dealt with within the compass of one
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0080"/>
<col>151</col>
speech. But, my Lords, it is a really important. Subject, and one that is worth consideration. I believe there is nothing which would be more fraught with benefit to the people of this country than that it should he studied, and studied, so far as it is possible to study this question, in an impartial spirit. With one remark of the noble Lord I cordially agree&#x2014;namely, that the man who is to be mainly considered is the small man who lives in a house in a populous area. If you increase the burden upon inhabited houses by the value of the house you certainly will prejudice the poor man at the expense of the richer one.<lb/>
But if you are going to relieve the humbler man, do get rid of the system of compounding. Do let the poor man know what he is paying. At the present time, by the operation of the system of compounding, he thinks that everything which he pays to the landlord is rent, and is put into the landlord's pocket. He sees the rent going up, and he thinks the landlord is selfish and grasping, and is putting a burden upon him for the benefit of himself. If there is one reform in this country more needed than another it is that, even if the rates are paid through the landlord, the sum should be gathered from the tenant in such a way as to show the tenant what he is paying for rent and what he is paying by way of rates for the services by which he is benefited. That is the one thing which I think everybody who has studied this question, whether from the imperial, local, practical, or social point of view, is absolutely agreed upon. I do hope that point will not be lost sight of if we are going into the reform of local burdens of taxation.<lb/>
In the course of this discussion grievances of various kinds have been touched upon. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton, was not quite accurate, I think, in saving that rating is all upon real property. I think I am right when I say that personal property includes leaseholds. Now leaseholds are rated, and, therefore, the real distinction in this matter is not between real and personal property, but between property which is movable and property which is immovable &#x2014;that is practically, as we know it, property which is rateable and property which is not rateable.<lb/>
There are also complaints from ratepayers in general that they are too much
<col>152</col>
burdened, and that too much is put upon them in proportion to those who own this non-rateable property. There are complaints also among special classes of ratepayers in the same district. There are complaints and discussions between urban ratepayers and country ratepayers, and there is also the question, which was touched upon in the course of this debate, as to the grievance between urban ratepayers and the owners of urban lands. But I am not going to enter into these topics. They are a fertile source of discussion, but I venture to think that too little has been made by some of the speakers of the distinction between various kinds of rates. One noble Lord behind me spoke of an average rate of so much, but there is nothing more fallacious than averages in this matter. You have to look at what makes up the rate. If you say that the average of country rates and urban rates is so much in the pound, it is a most misleading and fallacious statement, because in the larger sum there are a great number of services rendered and paid for which are not done for the man in the rural area. Let me give two instances which are at the extremes as between what are called national and onerous on the one side, and local and beneficial on the other. No one can say that a rate for the supply of water, or of drainage, is anything but a payment for a service rendered. On the other hand, a poor rate, is, perhaps, in its essence absolutely onerous, and though the effect of it and the amount of it are largely influenced by local policy, one can hardly say that either this or the payment for education is other than really a national service and the carrying out of national policy. You cannot, however, lay down a definite rule for all cases and say, "This service is national, that is local, this is onerous, that is beneficial." The two run into one another in such a way that you cannot form a catalogue or list of them and put on one side those which are national and those which are local. But all that is almost commonplace.<lb/>
The point I want to pass to is, What is the remedy for the admittedly unfair circumstances under which we are living? May I venture to say with what pleasure I heard the announcement of the noble Earl the Leader of the House, that the Government really mean to take up this question. I am afraid I have not much influence, but to those who have I venture
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0081"/>
<col>153</col>
to say that if those who are in power and authority in the two Parties could establish and lay down some general principle we should not have this matter discussed as a contest between town and country, between the owner of personal property and the owner of real property, between people in different parts of the country. I would like to see some sound principle laid down which would be of practically universal application. An important point, to which I do not think sufficient attention has been paid in the past, is the way in which the national contribution is to be given to the local administration of services. Everybody admits that it must be increased. But the danger is that, if those who are responsible for local administration find that the more they expend the greater will be the national assistance they will receive, a direct premium will be placed upon extravagance. That must be avoided. Personally I do not like the system of assigned revenues. I do not think it fair to the poorer localities. As to the suggestion made by one noble Lord that the Government should take over more services I do not think that can go much further than it has gone. For my part I would rather see the services efficiently conducted locally. It is much better for the locality, and infinitely more likely to tend to making ways and means meet each other, and to local needs being supplied. On account of the system under which the local revenue is raised, it is unfair to one class of property, and. I venture to say you cannot have anything in the nature of local Income Tax or anything of that kind. You must get the assistance out of the Imperial Exchequer.<lb/>
My Lords, the problem is how to be fair to the locality without risk of undue extravagance at the expense of the National Exchequer. It seems to me that the only way in which you can do it is to find some way of estimating what is the necessary minimum cost of any one of these services, which are partly national and partly local, in a given locality. This is no new point. This was, I frankly say, a fad of my own, and if any one will pay me the compliment of looking at the separate recommendations which I put into the Local Taxation Commission volume he will see there in full how it is worked out. Briefly the theory is this, that the contribution which is to be given from the central authority must have considerable relation to the necessary
<col>154</col>
cost of the service in question. This applies whether it is poor rate, or education, or such a matter as police; and it ought also so to be given as to afford a lever to the local authorities for improving local administration, both in efficiency and in economy. The only way that I can see of effecting this is by giving block grants, not by means of assigned revenue or by a payment once for all; but by a payment set for a period of years, to be revised according to changed circumstances and to have distinct relation to the ability of the locality to bear the burden. It may be difficult to test what is the ability of an individual ratepayer, but the ability of a locality is very easily ascertained by taking together the amount of the valuation and the population. You will find, if you look into it, that this system has this curious result, that it, gives more to the poorer localities, whether they are poor because they are densely populated localities or whether they are poor on account of the sparseness of their population and the low valuation. What I suggest is that it should be in all cases found out, as can easily be done, what is the average minimum expenditure necessary in any district for the due discharge of these services. When you have found out what is the certain minimum expenditure necessary in any district and the ability of the district to hear the burden, then a. test of administration can be applied by seeing whether the service very much exceeds the average cost or not. When it exceeds the average cost there should be a less contribution from the central authority in so far as that excess over the average cost was due to maladministration.<lb/>
It is, as I have said, difficult to deal with this complicated matter within the limits of a short speech, and. I would, therefore, suggest to the Government, or to any one interested in the subject, that they should look at the arguments and the calculations and the tables in the Report of the Local Taxation Commission to which I have already referred. What we all want to do is to prevent a district such as West Ham being overburdened on account of the density of the population and the comparative poverty of the inhabitants, and to take care that districts like the western isles of Scotland are not overburdened owing to the very opposite circumstances. You should see that the valuation of all districts is made upon
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0082"/>
<col>155</col>
something like a comprehensive and fair scale. It is perfectly obvious that if you leave the valuation to the district itself they will lower the valuation for the purpose of showing how much higher in the pound the rate is. You can lower a. valuation to such an extent as would show that 20s. in the pound is not more in one district than 8s. or 10s. in the pound in another. So long as you have no national system of valuation you are liable to this difficulty, that you place a premium on the locality to cut down its valuation as low as it. can. No one is more aware than myself how imperfect and fragmentary the remarks are that I have made, but I am most anxious that this aspect of the question should be considered, and I have been encouraged to bring it before the notice of those interested mainly on account of the promise we have received from the Leader of the House in the course of this debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00383"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no member of your Lordships' House who speaks with higher authority on this question than Lord Balfour, and certainly the suggestions he has made in this debate or at any other time carry the greatest weight, and I will undertake to convey the points he has raised to-day to my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I much regret the absence from the Government Bench of my noble friend Lord Fitzmaurice, whose wide experience and intimate knowledge of local government naturally entitle him also to speak with great authority, and would have enabled him to make an adequate reply to the observations of the noble Lord. All that I can attempt to do myself is to give some idea of the attitude of the Treasury in this matter, and to endeavour to reply to one or two of the criticisms that have been made against the Government.<lb/>
So far as I have followed the debate, it seems to me that it has disclosed a considerable measure of agreement as between both sides of the House. We are agreed for instance, that the present system is entirely unsatisfactory; we are agreed that it stands in need of revision, and that the relations of local and Imperial taxation require re-adjustment. The present system is unsatisfactory because it is a system of doles, because it is a haphazard system, because it is inequitable, and because it does not conduce to economical adminis
<col>156</col>
tration. For example, I am told that a penny rate on the United Kingdom would result in about &#x00A3;1,000,000 being raised. But supposing that a grant of &#x00A3;1,000,000 was made from the Exchequer our experience goes to show that that would certainly not result in a corresponding reduction of the local rates. Then there is confusion in keeping the accounts and inequalities of rating. Rich authorities with high rateable value and high local expenditure get an undue share, which ought in justice to be given to poorer ones. Then there is municipal indebtedness, to which several noble Lords have referred. I have one or two figures to show the very high rate at which this indebtedness has increased. In 1902&#x2013;3 the total amount of outstanding loans of local authorities in England and Wales, other than the Metropolitan Water Board, was &#x00A3;370,607,493. In 1907&#x2013;8 it was &#x00A3;455,522,578. These, I think, are rather alarming figures, and do give cause for serious and anxious consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00384"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Might I ask the noble Lord whether the figures he has quoted appear in any Return, or whether he is doing us the service of giving us original figures which we cannot otherwise obtain?

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00385"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I am happy to tell the noble Marquess that this Return was presented a day or two ago in another place, and, if he desires, I think it can be presented to your Lordships' House.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00386"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00387"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, in his rather interesting speech, adopted a somewhat novel way of taking the Government to task for the indebtedness of the country, because he lumped together municipal accounts and the accounts of the Imperial Exchequer and then said, "Look at what a terrible result you have arrived." But I would put it to him that we are not directly responsible for the alarming rate at which municipal debt is increasing, and I would remind him of the record of the Government with regard to the National Debt. Since
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0083"/>
<col>157</col>
the Government came into office the National Debt has been reduced by some thing over &#x00A3;40,000,000, and there is a provision in this year's Budget for a further &#x00A3;9,000,000 reduction. I think that is really a. very creditable financial record for any Government to hold.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl went on to attack us&#x2014;it is rather a. familiar complaint&#x2014;on the ground that Parliament had continued to place fresh burdens upon local authorities. I agree that Parliament has done so, hut, as my noble friend Lord Sheffield reminded the House, the Government of noble Lords opposite certainly did this to just as great an extent as, if not to a greater extent than, we have done. There was, for instance, the Education Act of 1902, which placed an enormous burden upon the rates. There was the Unemployed Workmen's Act, 1905, which also placed a very heavy burden on the rates; and it would be very easy for any one more familiar with the subject than myself to quote a number of instances Where Acts of Parliament of Conservative Governments have placed enormous burdens upon local authorities. If we have been sinners in this respect, I am bound to say that the noble Earl and his friends have been criminals of the deepest dye. Against that we may fairly also say that local authorities have frequently come to Parliament and asked for fresh powers which have considerably increased expenditure on their part.<lb/>
I would like to remind the House that at present the grants given by the Treasury to local authorities are very high. In the last year for which 1 have figures available, 1908, they amount to no less than &#x00A3;20,630,000. I could give details of how that grant is distributed, but I do not think it is necessary at this stage of the debate. The position is not quite the same as when this subject was debated in your Lordships' House some two years ago, because since then we have passed the Old Age Pensions Act. Old people will no longer be maintained by the rates, and therefore will not be a burden upon them. In England and Wales the number of paupers fell from 229,474 on the 31st March, 1906, to 196,064 on the 1st of January of this year, which shows a decrease of over 33,000, and allowing for the increase of population, including Scotland and Ireland, the actual decrease. I should say will be well over
<col>158</col>
40,000, which will give a relief of over &#x00A3;300,000 a year to local authorities in the country.<lb/>
Then there are the Land Taxes, half of which have been allocated, as noble Lords are aware, to local authorities. It is true that this year an arrangement has been come to whereby the Exchequer takes the yield of half of the Land Taxes that would have gone to local authorities and has given local authorities a sum of money slightly larger instead. It is also true that this year, and possibly for the next year or two, the yield of the Land Taxes may not be very high, but in years to come, when the increment value duty has fairly got into operation, this will yield a very considerable source of income, and I think the local authorities will enormously profit thereby.<lb/>
One or two remarks have been made about the particular case of London. I could go into that in some detail, but I will spare your Lordships at this hour. I will only say that London has one-seventh of the population of England and Wales' and has one-fifth of the rateable value, so that the rateable value per head is nearly fifty per cent. higher in London than elsewhere, and there is little doubt that there is a corresponding different taxable capacity. That shows an advantage to London in this matter, if the circumstances of the particular cases of England and Wales and London were comparable, there might be some case for giving London the extra grant for which the noble Earl asked this afternoon. But I maintain that the circumstances are not at all comparable, and I do not think the Treasury would be justified in giving this concession. The fact has been ignored that the Government contribute considerable sums, as much as &#x00A3;10,000 to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, &#x00A3;100,000 to the Metropolitan Police, and other contributions in lieu of rates in respect of Government property in London, and London has the further advantage of being the seat of Government in this country and practically the centre of the Empire, by which, I think, London indirectly benefits.<lb/>
The noble Earl has a Motion on the Paper in which he moves for a Return. I am informed that it would he very difficult indeed to give the particulars he wants with regard to foreign countries. That is the information I have from the Foreign Office. Lord Belper also asks for information, but
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0084"/>
<col>159</col>
as he did not put his request on the Paper, I am unable to give a definite reply. I will, how ever, refer the matter to the Foreign Office, and I will certainly undertake to obtain the information if the Foreign Office are able to give their assistance in the matter. Then the noble Earl moves for another Return giving the financial relations in British possessions. As to that I have to say that there are great difficulties in the way of giving the returns for which the noble Earl asks with regard to the Crown Colonies, but my noble friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies will communicate with the Dominion Governments and will ask them whether they are able to furnish the information desired, in which case, of course, it will be laid on the Table.<lb/>
Speaking generally, I think already there has been a good deal of discussion of this question, but it has not yet reached an acute stage like some of the controversies in which we have been engaged in the past two or three years. The noble Lord, Lord Balfour, suggests that both sides should endeavour to come to some agreement in this matter. I seriously hope that they may be able to do so, but I am bound to say I do see difficulties ahead. I think it is fairly obvious that pretty well every local authority in this country&#x2014;all the spending authorities: county councils, town councils, district councils, and boards of guardians&#x2014;will approach the Government. with a demand or request, as the case may be, for relief. It seems to me, if I may say so, that the taxpayer is a person who is entitled to a great deal of consideration in this matter. So far as I can gather from the remarks that most noble Lords have made, they all contend that burdens should be taken off the rates and placed on the Exchequer. The noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, appeared to think that ratepayers will have no opportunity of making their voices heard in this matter. My own opinion is exactly the contrary. It seems to me that ratepayers would bring pressure to bear upon Members of the House of Commons who would naturally urge the Government to do something for particular localities all over the country. I think very often it is the case that the ratepayers feel the burdens more acutely because a great many of them pay their rates in cash, while a very considerable number of taxpayers in this country pay their taxes in indirect taxation, in commodities like tea, sugar, coffee, and similar articles. It does seem to me,
<col>160</col>
therefore, that when a settlement of this question is in sight the claims of the ratepayers will be urged with even greater force than those of the taxpayers.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Clinton, in the course of his very interesting remarks, suggested that certain charges should be transferred from local authorities to the Exchequer. I am bound to say that I think it will be necessary to approach any proposal of that kind for any sweeping transference of a charge hitherto borne by the rates to the Exchequer with the utmost caution; and I think, whilst a comprehensive survey of what are local and what are national charges must necessarily be undertaken, that above all it will be necessary for this Government or any Government that may deal with this matter to endeavour to hold even the scales as between the ratepayers and the taxpayers of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00388"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although I do not think we shall agree with quite all that was said by the noble Lord who has just sat down, we cannot but congratulate my noble friend who opened this debate with so admirable a speech on the announcement that has been made by the Government. There is a substantial grievance, and the Government tell us that they propose to deal with the whole subject next year, and that in the interval they are willing to furnish us with all the information they can. We attach great importance to that, because I am sure it will be felt on all hands that the advantage of to-night's debate has been to show a great deal of common ground between the two sides and no sharp division of opinion as to the rival merits of the ratepayers and the taxpayers; and so far as we can get the information for which my noble friend has asked, we shall certainly be advancing towards more common ground in the consideration of the question.<lb/>
I have ventured to press upon your Lordships one point which I would mention again. I do think that all parties in this country are bound to use their influence, as far as they can, to arouse those who are responsible for electing public representatives to a realisation of the enormous expenditure which they are forcing on those representatives. Whether it can be done, as Lord Balfour proposes, by bringing home to individuals that they are paying rates, or whether in so doing we shall revert to a system which
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0085"/>
<col>161</col>
means an increased cost of collection, I cannot say; but I believe the noble Earl, who served longer than I did on the London County Council, will be of my opinion, that the enormous increase which goes on and which is not confined to one Government or to another is to be deprecated and that it is absolutely necessary that in agricultural districts some powers should be given, which I think are not now possessed in a good many county councils, to enable those responsible for the finance to check the otherwise perfectly legitimate demands, which conjointly mount up to so enormous a sum, by the various committees.<lb/>
I have not risen to make a speech, but I do feel that the whole of this subject, just as with regard to the subject of national expenditure, is absolutely slipping out of our hands, and that economy has gone to Saturn and Jupiter, as Mr. Gladstone was accustomed to say, and I feel that local expenditure is following suit For example, may I say that three hours ago when I was sitting on the Finance Committee of the London County Council we were approached with three schemes from different committees between them amounting to a million of money. Not one of the three committees had any idea that another committee was going to raise so large a question, and not one of the three, until it was pointed out to them, seemed to think it necessary that some authority should weigh what would be the charge on the ratepayers for the next fifteen or twenty years if the adoption of all those schemes was sanctioned. They considered they were all admirable, and that each of them ought to be carried out in some form or another. I mention that because the subject is getting far beyond ordinary ken.<lb/>
I want to make one reservation with regard to the speech of the noble Lord opposite. He pointed out that all Governments are guilty of throwing these charges on the ratepayers. I think there is a great deal of difference, if I may say so, between a large scheme deliberately thrown on the ratepayers with the full assent of Parliament, such, for instance, as the Education Act of 1902, and this constant frittering away of money with small Acts to which no attention is drawn. I cannot help hoping that your Lordships will set the example to the House of Commons by insisting on all Bills which do throw a charge on the ratepayers having some dis
<col>162</col>
tinguishing mark on that particular portion of the Bill which creates the charge. That is no unreasonable demand, and it would have very considerable effect in rousing such guardians of the local purse as my noble friend, Lord Helper, and others, and it would call your Lordships' attention to what we are engaged upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00389"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I might be allowed to express my gratitude at receiving the assurance which the noble Earl the Leader of the House was kind enough to give us in regard to the intention of the Government to deal with this question not later than next year. I trust that when His Majesty's Government do take up this matter they will very seriously consider the proposals put forward by Lord Balfour to-night, and which are contained in the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation. I remember some two years ago studying his system of block grants for the relief of local expenditure, which had the merit of taking into consideration the ability of the district, to pay for the services required, and which is the only system I have ever studied which seemed to me to encourage economy in the local body and at the same time relieve districts in proportion to their ability to bear the burden. I do not wish at this period of the evening to enter into any of the rather controversial questions which Lord Denman raised, such as the reduction of the National Debt, which is largely an automatic reduction owing to the process of the Sinking Fund. In initiating the discussion this evening I pointed out that I did not wish to make a Party question of this, or to make any attack on the Government for their delay in dealing with this matter. After what the noble Lord has said I will not press my Motion. I am quite content to leave it in the hands of His Majesty's Government to give us all the information, as I am sure they will do, that is in their power.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00393"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War why Yeomanry regiments are not equipped with proper buckets for the new rifles, and whether the allowance of blank ammunition cannot be increased.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00394">The noble Lord said: I rise to ask the Question that stands in my name. The matters referred to therein have, I think, been the subject of representation to the War Office, and I should like to hear what answer can be given by His Majesty's Government on the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00395"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that the question of the ammunition, as far as I can trace it, is not one that has been referred to us. This is the first we have heard that the allowance which is given at the present time is supposed to be inadequate. Twenty-five rounds per man are issued, and an extra ten rounds when the Territorial is man&#x0153;uvring with Regulars. We do not feel inclined to increase that if we can possibly help it, because it is an expense, and although it is a necessary expense it is one of those things that we like to keep down as low as we possibly can. With regard to the question of the rifle bucket, we are issuing instructions for the adaptation of the present rifle bucket to the short rifle. The bucket, of course, was designed for the long rifle, and I know there is some difficulty in carrying the short rifle with it; but if certain alterations are made, if the straps are shortened, we do not think that there will be any particular difficulty in carrying the rifle in the same way as the long rifle was carried. We are not disposed at the present time to consider providing the other bucket which has been asked for&#x2014;namely, the
<col>164</col>
bucket which the Cavalry have&#x2014;because, among other things, we do attach great importance to the Yeoman and his rifle being attached to each other, so that if he gets separated from his horse he will always have his rifle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00396"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am not officially informed, but I understand that there was a representation from Scotland as regards the insufficiency of the blank ammunition. It is a serious deficiency. You cannot with twenty-five rounds carry out all the field days, five or six in the course of training, and consequently these field days will lose half their value. It is impossible to understand how operations are to be conducted without having at least thirty or forty rounds per man, and I certainly understood that a. representation was made from Scotland last year for a grant of 200 rounds a year per man. That, I know, is considered by various commanding officers as the absolute minimum, and I know of one commanding office: who had to buy ammunition for one squadron of his regiment, this training or last training, to supply this want. With regard to the rifle buckets, if the Cavalry find it necessary to have these buckets it seems only reasonable to suppose that the Yeomanry also require them. I am glad to hear that some attempt is being made to improve matters, but certainly the present bucket is bad both for the horseman and rifle. If the present bucket can be adapted, well and good, but, if not, undoubtedly in the interests of all there should be a new bucket supplied. I also hope that the noble Lord will consider having a larger amount of blank ammunition. I am sure other representations will be made on the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00415" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00416">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00417"><member>VISCOUNT HILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill which stands in my name, and to which I am asking your Lordships to give a Second Reading this afternoon, is one which I think will commend itself to your Lordships. It is a non-contentious Bill, and I am thankful to say it is a non-Party Bill. As is set out in the Memorandum attached to the Bill, its object is to secure continuous physical training for the youth of both sexes up to the age of sixteen years, in order, as far as possible, to ensure for each young person the possession of sound and healthy vital organs, a. deep mobile chest, and the development of an evenly-balanced muscular and nervous system, and thus to arrest the deplorable physical degeneration disclosed by the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration.<lb/>
Before I attempt to touch upon any of the clauses, I should like to make a few
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0088"/>
<col>167</col>
remarks upon the general question. Physical training is no new idea, nor is it promoted by faddists, as some people imagine. It is backed by the whole of the medical profession throughout the civilised world. Sweden has had physical training for over a century, and we in England have to a certain extent introduced it in our Army and Navy and in our colleges in recent years, and two years. ago I congratulated His Majesty's Government upon introducing it into the education curriculum of our elementary and secondary schools. The only objection to the Government's scheme, to my mind, was that it did not go far enough. It only takes the education of our children up to the age of fourteen, at which age they leave school. The Bill that I am asking your Lordships to read a second time this afternoon takes children up to the age of sixteen, and I think we are all agreed that the ages between fourteen and sixteen, and even up to eighteen, constitute the most critical time in a child's life as far as his health and physical culture are concerned.<lb/>
I have for many years taken a great interest in the health of the children of the masses of this country, and I have personally studied the various systems of physical training throughout the world; and having carefully studied the subject, when this Bill was shown to me last year by the promoters&#x2014;the National Hygienic League &#x2014;I had no hesitation in informing them that it would give me great pleasure to introduce it in your Lordships' House. The information which I have acquired from personal experience of physical training shows that the children as a whole are not gaining or improving under the present system. The chief reason that I could find for that is that the teachers themselves do not possess that practical knowledge which they should have in order to impart this instruction to their pupils. For that reason the physical culture as it is at present given in our schools is practically useless as far as the health and future physique of the children are concerned. The object of this Bill is not to produce athletes or acrobats. That is not our object. Our object is to ensure for each young person good physical health in the future; and in order to do that it is absolutely necessary that the teachers themselves should have practical experience and knowledge of this physical training before they impart it to the children.<lb/>
<col>168</col>
I have quite recently been inspecting several of our schools throughout the country where this so-called physical culture is given under the Board of Education. What do I find? It is given in a very mechanical way. The teachers have a book laying down what they are to do, which way a child's arms are to be held, and how a child is to stand, and that is about all they know. They say it by heart, and that satisfies the inspectors. But that is practically no good for the child's health or his future physical culture. Ninety-five per cent. of the children would not be able to say why they were doing this drill, or what good it was going to do them in the future. That is exactly how physical culture is being taught in our schools at the present time. What I want to bring about by this Bill is an improvement in the physique and the health of the children of this country, and in order to do that we must have the teachers instructed upon a sound basis. The system which we propose in this Bill is based on the fact that time teachers should have an accurate theoretical and practical knowledge of the physiological effect of each exercise, which effect is pre-determined and specially localised. If we do this, the children will receive benefit from it.<lb/>
The physical welfare of the boys and girls of this country should be the first consideration, not only of the State, but of time whole Empire, and it must be very noticeable to any one who is constantly going through our large towns and cities that, almost every minute of the day you see children of all sizes and all grades with humped backs and congested and flat chests, half of them walking about with their mouths wide open&#x2014;a regular death trap, for they inhale every microbe. That alone should help to convince us of the necessity of devising some machinery by which our children can obtain proper physical exercise and be taught how to carry themselves in their every-day life. We know that the youths of this country have greatly deteriorated. In the time of Cromwell our race was known as the finest in the world, but I doubt very much if we can make that statement to-day. The average height of the Englishman to-day is about 5ft. 7in., and that of an Englishwoman 5ft. 5in., and I am given to understand by those who have obtained information on the point that in America and
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0089"/>
<col>169</col>
Sweden the average is 1&#x00BD;in. higher. We know that in recruiting for the British Army we have found great difficulty in obtaining men of the proper standard. I have figures here which show that out of 77,000 youths who offered themselves for enlistment over 29,000 were rejected as physically unfit. I claim that that would not have been the case if we had had a system of physical training in force such as is suggested in this Bill. And we remember what a great difficulty there was in the late South African war in finding men of physique and stamina to go to the Front.<lb/>
It is true that there are many gymnasia scattered all over the country, and in most schools physical training in some form or other is being taught; but in these cases how many of the children know what they are being taught this drill for? I regret to say that in many instances the teachers use these drills as a punishment for the children whom they are unable to manage in the classes. The consequence is that the child hates the drill and it is most distasteful to him. Under the provisions of this Bill I hope to make physical training a pleasure to the child. Violent exercises are not necessary. What is needed is careful instruction as to the child's proper way of standing and above all the proper way of breathing, which is really the base of the whole matter. If our children were taught how to breathe properly and how to stand, we should overcome a great many of the difficulties which we now experience. These flat-chested children in time develop lung and other diseases, but by a proper system of breathing and by physical exercises such as we propose in this Bill they would to a certain extent be able to fight against them.<lb/>
As I have said, ninety-five per cent. of the children in the schools to-day are quite unaware of the benefit receivable from physical culture; but if the children were properly taught I have not the slightest doubt that we should be able to bring the standard of our future generations up to what it ought to be. In order that we may have this physical training properly given, it will be necessary to set up some machinery by which either the present teachers in the schools may be so instructed that they will be able to impart the knowledge in a proper and efficient way to the children, or special teachers will have to be appointed to visit certain districts. This need not be a drill
<col>170</col>
which will be distasteful to the children. After they have been properly instructed as to the benefit they are to receive, they will take a pleasure in their drill, and there will be no occasion to use the compulsory clauses of which we have a few in the: Bill.<lb/>
I have no doubt that many of your Lordships have read the Report of Lord George Hamilton's Commission on the Poor Law, in an Appendix to which Mr. Sidney Jackson alludes to physical training and shows very clearly the great necessity there is for it in this country. Sweden introduced physical training in the year 1839, and to-day it forms part and parcel of their every-day life. Every man, woman, boy, and girl is doing physical training constantly in Sweden, with the result that they have good physique and are in a healthy condition; and in that country we do not see about the streets those poked heads, narrow chests, and humped backs which are so common in this country. In America of recent years they have also brought physical training greatly into effect. What can be done in other countries surely we can do in England.<lb/>
No doubt I shall be told by noble Lords opposite that one of the great difficulties is the expense. I do not intend to go into the financial side of the question, but I should like to say that already there is a large expenditure upon the physical training at present carried out in our schools, and I am told by experts that the extra physical training which I am asking for in this Bill will not be of such great cost that it need be specially mentioned in a Second Reading debate. From what I can understand, there is a very good scheme prepared by the National Hygienic League, which if taken into consideration by His Majesty's Government, would enable this Bill to be put into operation very easily. There are several clauses in the Bill which I fully expect will be criticised. I hope that the criticisms will be many, because it will enable us to put the Bill into better shape. I think I can assume that the principle of the Bill will be accepted by all your Lordships, but no doubt the machinery which has been devised to carry it out may receive rather severe criticism. I have heard that there are to be some criticisms upon certain clauses, but not knowing what those criticisms will be I cannot anticipate them.<lb/>
I believe there are some difficulties with regard to making arrangements with the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0090"/>
<col>171</col>
Board of Education for carrying out the training of the teachers. Probably that will be one criticism. There will be another criticism upon the continuation of these classes after the child has left school, but I do not see any reason why there should be. We already have evening classes, at which the attendance is very good. The boys are being taught trades of all kinds, and the girls domestic economy. I think if we were to add a good physical training we should then have some of the most perfect schools in the world. If a child attended these physical drills twice or three times a week, it would be sufficient, once he understood what he was to do and what benefit he was to receive by it, to enable him to carry on the physical culture himself in his own home. I am perfectly certain that it would be done with the greatest pleasure by all children, and that there would be no difficulty as far as that is concerned. Neither would there be any objections raised by parents, for since this Bill has been in circulation I have received communications from all parts of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, not from teachers and experts, but from parents themselves, welcoming the Bill and expressing the hope that it will become law. I do not think I need go into particulars of the clauses, because I should like to hear the criticisms of those who will speak after me. But before sitting down I would say that the criticisms might be met to a certain extent by our meeting together and consulting on the matter, and probably if the Bill reaches another stage they could be met by the insertion of Amendments. I commend the Bill to your Lordships, and I trust that it will meet with a favourable reception at your hands and at the hands of His Majesty's Government, and that we shall in the near future see it passed into law. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014; (<i>Viscount Hill</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00418"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we have all listened with sympathy to the words that have fallen from the noble Viscount. At the same time the noble Viscount seems to be in ignorance of the fact that physical exercises have been carried out in the schools of this country for a great deal longer than two years. It is now twenty-one years since I myself introduced a Bill into this House. I re-introduced the Bill twenty years ago. It was rejected at the time, as most novel
<col>172</col>
measures are in Parliament, but the third year it was introduced it was accepted practically <i>en bloc</i> by the Liberal Government of the day. I went to the Minister who was responsible for education at the time, and who had just come into office, and asked him if he was going to oppose my proposal like his predecessor had done. He said, "No, I do not think there is any reason for it. I think I can incorporate your Bill in my Code." That was done; and ever since those days physical exercises have been carried on in the schools of this country.<lb/>
I cannot say that I agree with all the noble Viscount has said about the small effect which those physical exercises have had upon the children. I am not here to defend His Majesty's Government. They are perfectly capable of defending themselves, and we shall hear what their spokesman has to say later. But my experience, and it is a large experience, is not that of the noble Viscount. I am continually going round visiting schools, not only in my neighbourhood but in others, in connection with another matter, and I have never yet found a school where there is no actual practical drill. I have found that as a general rule really excellent work is being done. I do not think the noble Viscount is aware&#x2014;at all events he has not mentioned it&#x2014;that these physical exercises are done under regulation and organisation. After the Government of the day accepted the Bill which I brought in and included it in their Code, a Committee, on which I had the honour of sitting, was appointed by the War Office and the Education Department, and a gentleman named Colonel Fox was put at the head of it. A syllabus was drawn up. That syllabus has, no doubt, been altered since those days, and what I thought was a very useful part of it&#x2014;the military part&#x2014;has been to a large extent eliminated. But at all events the syllabus is there. I hold in my hand the last syllabus of physical exercises for public elementary schools issued by the Board of Education in l909, and if the noble Viscount reads that syllabus lie will see that Sir Robert Morant and those who work with him have gone very thoroughly into the question. They have considered very carefully all that is absolutely necessary for the health of the children, and although there are parts of the syllabus with which I do not agree&#x2014;especially, as I have said, the one
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0091"/>
<col>173</col>
from which military drill has been eliminated&#x2014;still I must say I think that, as far as it goes, it is an excellent system.<lb/>
I would also point out to the noble Viscount that this system has been founded in a great measure upon the very one which he has been pressing&#x2014;the Swedish system. I know that that system was introduced, because I was chairman of a voluntary association which gave &#x00A3;400 to bring over from Sweden one of the first teachers who gave instruction to the teachers in London in the Swedish system. No doubt there have been alterations from the actual pure Swedish system, but I do not think there are any alterations with which the noble Viscount or any one else can find fault. Therefore I am glad to be able to say that I do not agree with the noble Viscount in his statement that the exercises, as far as they have gone, have not been of use. I have judged on four different occasions the exercises of the children attending the London elementary schools, and I can tell the noble Viscount that if he would go to one of those exhibitions and see the exercises performed he would be more than pleased. It is wonderful what the children do, and their work is a source of great delight and pleasure to any one who feels, as we all do, that this matter is one of very great importance to the nation at large. The noble Viscount speaks about acrobats. I have never seen any acrobatic performances of any kind or description in connection with elementary schools. The performances that I have seen are almost entirely Swedish&#x2014;pthat is to say, without apparatus. Of course, it is absolutely wrong that this drill should be given as a punishment, but I have never known it so given. If it is done, I should hope that after the debate to-night such a thing will be stopped. As a matter of fact, the drills that I have seen are enjoyed by the children. I do not know whether, if you were to ask every child whether he is aware of the purport of the drill, he would be able to give you an answer, but I do not think it very much matters whether he knows what the drill is for or not, as long as the drill is improving his physical condition.<lb/>
I regret very much that the noble Viscount has put into his Bill a clause directly eliminating military drill. I think that is a most fatal thing for the Legislature of this country to do. The trend of
<col>174</col>
public opinion, whatever some of us may think, is in the direction of military drill for the young. Our Colonies are showing us the way to do it, and we shall have to come to it some day whether we like it or not; and it appears to me a fatal and retrograde measure to put a clause into a Bill saying that under no circumstances whatever shall military drill be carried out in the schools of this country. I hope that that clause, at all events, will be deleted. I do not suppose for one moment that the noble Viscount really desires the elimination of military drill. We know there are people in this country who believe that military drill is very wicked. How they can arrive at that conclusion I, for one, am absolutely at a loss to understand. But I suppose the noble Viscount thought it was wise and expedient to put in such a clause in order that the Bill might pass.<lb/>
Personally, I do not see any necessity for the Bill except in regard to the raising of the age, and in that I entirely agree with the noble Viscount. At present we only have physical exercises up to the age of 14, and I, for one, should be delighted to support any Bill which would make it compulsory upon every child to go through physical exercises up to the age of sixteen, and I would even say longer. In Sweden the age is eighteen, and no difficulty has been found with regard to it there. I would also give one warning to the noble Viscount. I have had a good deal of experience in regard to physical exercises. I have been myself at the head of one of the teachers' associations for physical exercises. The noble Viscount must remember that there are a great number of systems of physical exercises in this country. They all want to have the knife in each other, and he must be very careful that he does not run a Bill for the express purpose of one particular class of teacher. We have to keep quite clear of that in a national work. In conclusion, I repeat that, while sympathising with the noble Viscount in the general purport of his Bill, I must say that in the particular subjects to which I have alluded I entirely disagree with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00419"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the objects of the Bill as set forth in the Memorandum on the first page I am in entire sympathy. I cannot say that I entirely approve of the methods which it is proposed to adopt, but I shall confine my criticism to one single point. The Bill contains a most extraordinary pro-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0092"/>
<col>175</col>
vision, a provision so extraordinary, and, as it seems to me, so uncalled-for, that it has given rise to a suspicion that the objects of the promoters as set forth in the Memorandum are not their whole objects and that they have some ulterior object. The provision I refer to is that contained in Clause 4, subsection (2), which runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided always that no child or young person shall, in the course of any physical training by this Act provided, be allowed to use, or be taught the use of, any war weapon of any kind whatsoever."</quote>
Why has this provision been inserted? With what object? At whose instigation? The noble Viscount was silent on the matter; but from what I know of him myself I find it very difficult to believe that he can be in sympathy with it. On the contrary, I should be very much surprised if he were not glad to see it eliminated.<lb/>
This provision is directly contrary to the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee, upon which the Bill professes to be based. I imagine that this provision has been put in to appease those who are known as Little Englanders. But why should we seek to appease them? Why should the noble Viscount pander to these people, with whom I know he has no sympathy whatever? It is difficult to understand the attitude of those who object to the principle of universal military service, but it is impossible to understand the attitude of mind of those who would hinder and discourage that voluntary system of military service on which we depend at the present time. Surely there is some strange inconsistency about those who object to compulsion on principle, and yet who would apply this very principle of compulsion in this drastic form for the purpose of giving physical training. I say if you are going to extend the principle of compulsion which forms part of all our legislation, and more particularly of all the laws which have to do with education and the training of the young, then why should not the State get all the advantage it possibly can from that compulsion? Why should the State impose on itself this restriction which is contained in the particular section of the Bill which I have read? Why should it fetter the discretion of the local authorities? What becomes of those principles of local self-government and trust in the people with which we are all so ready to profess our sympathy and our belief?<lb/>
<col>176</col>
I take it that no one will disagree that the first necessity of the State, indeed of any State, is that of self-protection, of defence, and I think it is also pretty clear that if you have healthy and vigorous citizens they are better capable of taking part in the defence of the State than those who are weak and degenerate and of the description to which the noble Viscount referred. But if that be so, why should the State pay for this additional physical training and then deliberately and of its own will forego the greatest advantage which might result from it? I go a step further. Why should you deprive your physical training of that one element which would be more likely than any other to make it effective? We all know that brain and muscle depend and interact on one another. Very little advantage can be derived from muscular exercises unless there is sonic mental stimulus. We all know that an interesting and exciting game does a great deal more good than mere exercises with dumbbells or Indian clubs. If you want the whole population to improve their physique and to do so with heartiness and goodwill&#x2014;and that was one of the points on which the noble Viscount particularly dwelt, and I may say that it impressed me that he felt undue confidence in his system in that very respect&#x2014;you must give them some motive which appeals to the imagination, and it must be a motive which affects the nation as a whole.<lb/>
The noble Viscount told us that most of the children who go through the present-day physical exercises do not know what the drill is for, and he was eager to admit that this was a disadvantage and marred the value of those very physical exercises. Surely that is a point to which lie ought to have given attention. He ought to have supplied this mental stimulus. He ought to have provided a motive which appeals to the nation as a whole. What higher and better motive is there than that of patriotism? If you make the object of your physical exercises one which has direct reference to patriotism, you will give that stimulus, and one which will be understood by all, even by the youngest child; and I defy any one to name any other motive which could take the place of such a one. And in this respect I should like to ask, Why are the patriotic to pay for their own physical training when it is a matter of Cadet Corps, Church Lads
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0093"/>
<col>177</col>
Brigade, and so forth, while the unpatriotic are to get it at the public expense? That seems to me to be an inconsistency which requires some explanation.<lb/>
We all want to improve the physique of the nation&#x2014;I take it we are all thoroughly alive to the unsatisfactory condition of the national physique at the present time&#x2014;and I do not hesitate to say that I am one of those who believe firmly that the proper method of doing so is that of universal military service. That is a method which is known to be successful. We have the example of other countries. We have the example of our own country in the past. The noble Viscount himself admitted it. He told us that in the days of Cromwell the physique of our nation was better than that of any other. But to those who do not care for the teachings of history, or for the example of foreign nations, I would point to the great success which attends military form of exercises at the present time. By what method can you do more good to poor, weedy lads from the slums of great cities than by giving them a spell of military training in a seaside camp or elsewhere, and by giving them some of the advantages which the rich obtain anyhow, and which are out of the reach of the poor? With those examples before us, why should we go and deliberately say that the military method of physical training is to be barred?<lb/>
You object to militarism, whatever militarism might mean. You are not going to check militarism by keeping the people ignorant of the use of the weapons of war. If you want to check militarism you must keep soldiers out of their sight. You must never let them see a soldier or heat anything about the Army. But if you think that there is so much latent and potential military ardour in the nation that the mere fact that they are taught to shoot with the rifle will make them all burn with a desire to go into the Army, how can you consistently say that the nation as a whole will never accept universal military service? Again, you profess to be democratic, and I presume it is considered to be democratic to give in a measure of this kind to the poor advantages at the public expense which are at present only within the reach of the well-to-do. If that be your principle, why withhold from them the healthy and admittedly beneficial exercise of practice with military
<col>178</col>
arms and particularly of rifle shooting? I said at the outset that I was going to confine my criticism to this one point, and I will do so. I feel very strongly upon it, and if the Bill gets to a further stage I shall certainly ask your Lordships to omit subsection (2) of Clause 4.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00420"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BANGOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the view of the noble Lord who has just sat down I entirely concur. I should be exceedingly glad to see a measure for universal military training passed into law. The provision which the noble Viscount has inserted in the Bill apparently in order to make it easier to pass has been used as an argument against the whole Bill. But whatever may be said with regard to the earlier part of the Bill, there is one clause in it&#x2014;I refer to Clause 5&#x2014;which makes me hope that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading. It is in entire accord with the recommendations of the important Commission which sat upon the relief of distress that something should be done to keep a hold upon those boys who leave school at the age of fourteen, and Clause 5 constitutes a great step forward in dealing with those who form the large class of "unemployables." I hope your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading, although I trust that in Committee the clause which has been so severely criticised by the noble Lord who has just sat down will be deleted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00421"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to associate myself with the expressions of general approval of the principle which underlies this Bill, and the desire that there should be a complete system of physical training in this country. But having expressed so much approval of the principle of the Bill, the noble Viscount probably knows enough about the general practice in debates in this House to expect that I shall now venture to explain to him various reasons why the Bill as it stands is not acceptable to His Majesty's Government. It was with regret that I heard the noble Viscount express disapproval of the present physical education which is given in the schools of this country. 1 would venture to ask him, however, in what way this Bill will improve that physical education. It leaves it in the hands of the same authorities as have the control of it at the present time, and I think it will be necessary for him to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0094"/>
<col>179</col>
include in his Bill sonic assured method of getting the physical education more in accordance with what he wishes it to be.<lb/>
I think it only fair to point out, on behalf of the Board of Education, that the work of physical training in the schools has lately been reorganised. It is only since January that the work has been so reorganised, and I am sure the noble Viscount would be one of the first to acknowledge that work of this kind cannot be remedied all at once. The thing is to train the teachers, and I can assure him that that work is already in hand. It was only last night that the President of the Board of Education made a general statement upon the work of his Department, and I shall venture to quote to your Lordships the passages which especially refer to physical education. My right hon. friend said&#x2014;
<quote>"On another side of their physical condition I have to report that great developments have taken place in the matter of physical exercises. Two years ago some members of my Board embarked on devising a general physical exercise syllabus, largely on the Swedish system. That syllabus has met with great acceptance, and 92,000 copies of it have been sold. It would be impossible to carry on the physical exercise work in all the schools under the local education authorities unless the teachers were prepared to play a part in it, and in the training colleges no fewer than 4,700 students have passed the examination in physical exercise since Christmas of last year. That means that;those teachers who go up from the training colleges will not be specialised physical exercise teachers, but it will be part of their ordinary work."</quote>
My right hon. friend went on to make a reference to military service which I am afraid will not commend itself to noble Lords who have taken part in this discussion. Speaking of the difference between military service and physical training and emphasising the advantage that is given to children especially from physical training, he said&#x2014;

<col>180</col>
the very training and opportunity that would be provided under a military system, and, moreover, military service does not include women and girls, and can be in no way a substitute for physical exercise. And it can only include those who are comparatively grown-up. What we want to-day is to get hold of the children as early as possible and enable them not only to develop their muscles when grown-up, but to grow up well."</quote>
I think every member of your Lordships' House will agree that whatever we may think as to the benefits of military training, it ought to be preceded by some system of physical training.<lb/>
Perhaps I might now turn to some of the criticisms that were offered by Lord Ampthill. I should like, in the first place, to offer one humble word of defence for the clause which he so much dislikes&#x2014;the clause which prohibits the use of war weapons. I believe it is so at the present time that recruits before joining the Army are generally trained by a system of Swedish drill. They are not trained, that is to say, with the help of war weapons; and I would venture to ask noble Lords who wish war weapons to be used in this way, what kind of war weapon they would wish in order to assist physical training? In order to develop the muscles generally there is no weapon of war in general use which can effectively be used with a system of Swedish drill. Scientific physical training is far more likely to develop the muscles and physique of children than any exercises with rifles or even with larger implements of war. I might even quote the noble Lord (Lord Ampthill) himself as an example. We are apt, I think, many of us to point to the noble Lord as perhaps the most. splendid specimen of physique in this House. May I put it to him that that splendid result was not attained by the use of the rifle, but more, I think, by the oar, with which he obtained so many successes at Henley in years gone by. I think, in these circumstances, it is not unfair to say that the use of. weapons of war is probably not the best method of obtaining a good physical result.<lb/>
I now turn to one or two of the detailed criticisms upon some of the clauses of the Bill. The curriculum of the elementary school is already so full that we should very strongly object to that clause in the Bill which requires that as much as two hours a week should be devoted to this system of physical training. I think it is only fair to say, too, that that period which is devoted
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0095"/>
<col>181</col>
to what is definitely called physical training at the present time does not comprehend he whole of the time which is spent in improving the physique of the children. In their play very often, also in the way in which they are made to stand and breathe while reading, and in matters of that kind, a great deal is done by the teachers to improve the physique of the children. although it is not given under the heading of physical training. Then I come to the examining Board. I think that that could hardly be undertaken by the Board of Education except at considerable expense. That is a subject to which I shall refer in a moment, but one which, after the debate we had yesterday in this House, I think ought to attract special attention from noble Lords, especially-in view of the somewhat airy way in which it was dealt with by the noble Viscount. We do not feel, either, that there is any need to create a special <i>ad hoc</i> committee for physical training under each local education authority in the way the noble Viscount suggests. There would not be very much work for such a committee to do, and we should very much object to an officer of the authority being an <i>ex-officio</i> member of such a committee. It would be much more to the point and bring a better result about if the larger local education authorities were to appoint paid organisers for the teaching of physical training within their area.<lb/>
The other clause to which I think strong objection would be taken throughout the country is Clause 5, which certainly at the present time I do not think the country would adopt. By that clause all young people until they reach the age of sixteen years are to attend continuation schools for physical training at least two evenings in the week. Just think for one moment what the expense would be of bringing that about. You would have to hire rooms, you would require teachers, you would have to have lighting, you would require inspectors, and in an infinity of ways very large further expense would be thrown on the rates. The improvement which has taken place, or is, we hope, going to take place rapidly in the near future, in physical exercises will, we trust, go a very long way towards meeting what is the real object of this Bill. The Board hope to make examination in physical training compulsory upon all non-collegiate students.<lb/>
The special question of expense, I think, bears not only with regard to these young
<col>182</col>
persons up to the age of sixteen, but also upon the further matter of the examination' of the various teachers. The Board, by the Bill of the noble Viscount, is expected to undertake the examination in physical training of the students in training colleges and also of non-collegiate students. In addition to that, of course, there are all the teachers who are now working in the schools. Of those there are 135,000, in addition to whom there are a large number of supplementary and unqualified teachers. Therefore it is not unreasonable to say that the Board would have to make arrangements for the examination in this matter of 150,000 teachers. I do not pretend that all those would wish or be able to undertake the work of physical training, but no doubt a large number of them would wish to get the additional qualification, and also the additional salary, which would be a further charge on the rates, and which is suggested by the noble Viscount in Clause 2, subsection (4). The general examination suggested by this Bill in order to be effective would naturally have to be somewhat thorough. An examination in practice could not take much less than ten minutes in connection with each individual, and with such a large number as the noble Viscount contemplates would pass through this examination, not only in point of time but also of numbers considerable expense must be incurred.<lb/>
I have stated the objections to the Bill in its present form. It is impossible for me to advise your Lordships to give it a Second Reading on this occasion. I think what I have been able to say to the noble Viscount and what has been said by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Meath) proves sufficiently that the Board of Education are fully alive to the importance of this matter. They have taken a new start, and have already organised a much better system of physical training; and I venture to hope and to think that if the noble Viscount will suspend his judgment until there has been time to see the result of the very important new steps and new departures which have been taken by the Board, your Lordships will on a future occasion be better able and better qualified to deal with the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00424"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, every one who listened to the speech of the noble Viscount behind me must have realised that his heart is in his
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0096"/>
<col>183</col>
work, and that he desires to arrest the deplorable physical degeneration disclosed by the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee. With the object which my noble friend has in view I feel sure every one in your Lordships' House will agree. Speaking as one who has been at the head of the Board of Education, I do not hesitate to say that I view a great deal that is in this Bill with hearty sympathy. The noble Viscount expressed the hope that the Bill would be considered non-controversial and non-political. It is in that sense that I propose to deal with it in the few remarks that I shall make to-night. And the noble Viscount also invited criticisms in order that by that means he might realise the shortcomings in his Bill, and he enabled, by amending the Bill, to carry through some of its principles with which we all agree.<lb/>
At the root of the whole matter is the question how far we can improve the present system of what used to be called when I was at the Board of Education physical exercises, but now termed physical training. My noble friend seems to think that if we could have a perfect system of physical training we might be able to improve the physique of those unfortunate children who abound in our great cities, and restore them to that state of vigour which we should all like to see. But I am afraid a good deal more than physical exercises would be required to bring about this happy state of affairs. I think the children to whom the noble Viscount alluded undoubtedly owe their unhealthy condition to other circumstances than the absence of physical exercises. They owe their condition perhaps to overcrowding, perhaps to want of proper nourishment, and perhaps also to the fact that the ordinary laws of health are not properly observed by their parents. Therefore if we are to effect this change which we all wish to see in the physique of the childen of this country, it can only be done by the Home Office, the Local Government Board, the Board of Education, and the various local authorities in all parts of the country acting together, and endeavouring, by combination, to cope with this state of affairs. While, therefore, I cordially sympathise with the object my noble friend has in view, I hardly think that physical exercises alone would have the effect which he desires.<lb/>
There are one or two provisions in the Bill as it stands which I think it would be some-
<col>184</col>
what difficult to carry out. My noble friend proposes to make physical drill compulsory in all elementary schools. There is a certain amount of difficulty about that. The Board of Education naturally are, in the first instance, responsible for the subjects which are taught in schools&#x2014;of course to a certain extent in conjunction with the local authorities; but those subjects are always put before the country in the shape of the Code which is published annually. It seems to me that it would be an entire innovation to select one subject, and one subject only, and make that a matter of legislative enactment, leaving all the other subjects as they are now- at the disposal of the Board of Education through their Code. I mention that because I think that an innovation of that kind ought to be seriously considered before it is passed into law. If once a question is made the subject of legislative enactment away from the Code, it is impossible to say how many other questions might not be brought forward for similar treatment. I remember that when' I was President of the Board of Education I received important deputations on the subject of hygiene. It might be said that hygiene ought to be dealt with by legislative enactment if you so deal with the question of physical exercises. Therefore on these grounds I think it would be dangerous to carry this Bill as it stands, making such a radical change in the system which up to now has worked very satisfactorily.<lb/>
There is certainly a good deal to be said in favour of a system of physical training. I confess I heard with a certain amount of regret the criticisms of the noble Viscount with regard to the physical training given at the present moment in the elementary schools. If the Board of Education had disregarded the subject. of physical exercises, then there would have been a good deal of justification for the arguments he put forward. But I venture to say that the Board of Education have never disregarded this question. The subject of physical training was brought very prominently forward by a Commission appointed by the late Duke of Devonshire to consider the whole question of physical deterioration, and it was shortly after that Commission reported that I had the honour of being Minister of Education. I can certainly say that no Minister ever went to the Board of Education more keenly alive than I was to the advantages to be derived from physical exercises. In my own schools in
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0097"/>
<col>185</col>
thickly-populated districts I have always taken a great interest in this subject, and therefore it came to me as a labour of love when I assumed office.<lb/>
As the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Meath, has informed your Lordships, we took the matter in hand at. once. The Government felt very strongly on the question. and the War Office rendered us great assistance in placing at. our disposal Colonel (now. I am glad to say, Sir Malcolm) Fox, an expert in teaching the whole system of physical exercises. I realised when I went to the Board of Education that what the teachers required was to be themselves taught how to give this instruction. I visited many schools after I was at the Board of Education, and saw that the teachers did not themselves know how to teach. I saw, too, how the children suffered in consequence. But on visiting those schools at. the termination of my tenure of office I observed a great difference; and my noble friend Lord Meath has stated that he, too, saw the same satisfactory results. Therefore I felt a little hurt when the noble Viscount. stated that the teachers could not teach, and that as a result the condition of the children was very unsatisfactory in this regard. am not in a position to express any opinion as to how the system is carried on at the present time, but I gather from the Reports that the Board of Education are carrying on physical training with the same vigour that obtained when I was Minister for Education. Indeed, I understand they have done more. In those days this movement was in its infancy and we had only one inspector. I understand that there are now four inspectors who go about the country carrying out the policy which was inaugurated by Colonel Fox&#x2014;that of instructing the teachers how to give physical training.; and I understand that in the training colleges physical training is compulsory. Although physical training is not legally compulsory at the present moment in the elementary schools, still under the policy carried out by us and continued by the present Government it is being given and has achieved good results.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me also desires that there should be compulsory physical training at the continuation classes. I think myself that if that were possible to be done, it would have a very excellent effect. I have been told by young soldiers that in the three years or so between leaving the
<col>186</col>
elementary schools and joining their regiments as recruits they have lost all the knowledge obtained while at the elementary school. Therefore it does seem to me an unfortunate state of affairs, seeing that we spend millions a year on the education of the children in the elementary schools, that the benefit of that education should be entirely lost in many cases in those intervening years. Now arises the question as to how that difficulty is to be met. My noble friend's proposal goes a long way towards meeting it. At the same time we have to consider the difficulty of those who feel that they require the services of these boys or young men in the employment in which they are engaged. Still, I think we ought to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion not to allow the wastage of this vast sum of money owing to the lack of educational training of some sort during these particular years of a boy's life. But if this Bill is read a second time, my noble friend will have to insert in the second part of it some carefully worded exemptions. At the present time there are a great number of boys who have left school but who would be unable to take advantage of these particular physical exercises.<lb/>
We recently formed the Boy Scouts, a most admirable organisation, calculated to do a great work in the future, and these boys, in addition to receiving discipline, are given very healthy recreation. There are other similar organisations, and in connection with all these bodies there are gymnasia. You have also many athletic organisations, and I should be sorry, by compelling these boys to attend continuation schools for this training, to do anything to injure these organisations. We must remember that a good many of these boys when they go to work have not much time for recreation, and to take a boy whose heart is in the Roy Scouts or in athletics and compel him for two nights in the week to attend compulsory physical training would not do that boy any good, for his heart would be away from this work and lie would look with disfavour upon it; it would not do him that good which it would do if he had no other means of exercise. That is a point which my noble friend ought to carefully consider.<lb/>
But I do think something ought to be done to prevent boys from the age of fourteen to eighteen losing the advantages they have derived at the elementary school. I
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0098"/>
<col>187</col>
hope that in what I have said my noble friend will not think I have thrown any cold water on his scheme. The principle of his Bill has my hearty sympathy; but I did think it was my duty, having had the advantage of being Minister for Education for four years, to bring forward, I hope in a modest manner, the experience I derived during that time. In all the circumstances, I hope your Lordships will see your way to give the Bill a Second Reading, on the understanding that considerable alterations will be made in it when it reaches the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00425"><member>LORD BARNARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill embodies one principle which has not been referred to in the course of the debate, and which, I think, deserves the consideration of your Lordships before the Question is put whether the Bill should be read a second time. The right rev. Prelate opposite stated that if for only one reason&#x2014;namely, the provisions in Clause 5&#x2014;he is prepared to support this Bill. It is the provision in subsection (2) of that clause which raises great doubt. in my mind whether the Bill should be read a second time. If the Bill were to pass in its present form, every naughty boy or naughty girl who did not attend the compulsory training on two evenings a week would practically be liable to be treated more or less as a. criminal and haled before a Court of summary jurisdiction and fined; and not only the young person, but even the parent, and, perhaps, the employer, might be involved in a like liability. The tendency to create offences of this kind at the present day requires very serious consideration, and unless my noble friend who has introduced the Bill can give me some assurance that this provision in it will be reconsidered at a future stage I shall feel bound to vote against it, for, as I have said, I am entirely opposed to provisions which create new criminal offences without serious cause.</membercontribution></p>

wise to postpone its further consideration. I think the publicity which he has given to the question to-day, and the general approval he has obtained of the principles which he desires to see carried out, are a great advance on which he may congratulate himself, and if he were to take back the Bill for reconsideration on the points raised he would not lose anything, because obviously exigencies of time make it exceedingly improbable that the Bill can be carried into law this year, and lie might, at an early period next session, reintroduce the Bill with the criticisms met to some degree.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00432">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00433"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL. CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have a little Bill to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading. It is a Bill which I do not think will take up much of your Lordships' time, and on which I hope and believe you will be practically unanimous. It provides compensation for tenants on whom notice to quit is served with a view to the use of their land for the provision of small holdings under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act which your Lordships were pleased to pass in 1908. This Bill is unopposed and has been agreed to by the Commons House of Parliament. As a matter of fact, it is a consequential Bill.<lb/>
The result of the Act of 1908 up to date has been that 80,000 acres, or 125 square miles, of land have been secured for holdings for 0,000 applicants, 4,000 of whom are already on the ground. In the vast majority of eases I ant glad to be able to assure your Lordships that the land has been secured without any hardship being imposed on the sitting tenants, but I do not disguise the fact that there may have been a few cases in which loss, or at any rate inconvenience, may have been incurred, and this Bill provides, I hope, a practical remedy by granting compensation in such cases. This we propose to do without placing any charge whatever on the rates or on the landlords. The Bill is a simple one, and well drawn. There is no reference to any other legislation, and any man who runs can read it, and, what. is more, can understand it.<lb/>
The first clause, which is perfectly intelligible, runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Where a council, or a landlord at the request of a council, terminates a tenancy of land by notice to quit, with a view to the use of the land or any part thereof by the council for the provision of
<col>190</col>
small holdings, the tenant upon quitting shall be entitled to recover from the council compensation for the loss or expense directly attributable to the quitting which the tenant may unavoidably incur upon or in connection with the sale or removal of his household goods or his implements of husbandry, produce, or farm stock on or used in connection with the land."</quote>
It is also provided that no compensation under this section shall be payable if the claim for compensation is not made within three months after the time at which the tenant quits. Under the Land Tenure Act the tenant has to give notice of his intention to claim within two months after the receipt of the notice to quit. Under this Bill the tenant whose land is required is better treated. Your Lordships will also see that differences are to be settled, in default of agreement, by a single arbitrator. That is following the lines of Section 13 of the Consolidated Lands Acts.<lb/>
Clause 1 also gives the procedure that we recommend. The county council is to pay the compensation to the tenants but is repaid by the Board of Agriculture, and the money is found out of the Small Holdings Fund. I have no doubt that we shall get a good many applications for compensation. When there is money going about it is very natural that many people should try to get what they can. I remember that some years ago, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Balaclava Charge, a dinner was given to the survivors of the gallant Six Hundred, and between 400 and 500, military gentlemen were found under the hallucination that they had been at that memorable battle. They had to be weeded out, and I hope that we shall also be able to weed out any of those gentlemen connected with the agricultural industry who may be under the hallucination that they have been unfairly treated. I venture to think, and I hope, that cases of hardship, will really be few and far between.<lb/>
There is a proviso in Clause 2 that no compensation shall be payable if the claim for compensation is not made before September 1, 1910. To-day is July 14. That would leave only six weeks, and the Bill is not through yet. Therefore I think your Lordships will probably be of opinion. that the time given is rather short, and I shall be prepared&#x2014;and I think it would be only right to do so, as we want to act perfectly fairly and justly to agriculturists&#x2014;to give a longer time than that now stated.
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0100"/>
<col>191</col>
in the Bill. Clause 2 also makes the Bill retrospective. In such cases compensation will be paid direct by the Board of Agriculture, not through the county councils, and the amount is left, as I think your Lordships will agree it should be, to the discretion of the Board. It would be absolutely useless to try and hold an arbitration on a tenancy that had expired a year or eighteen months ago. Therefore I think your Lordships will agree that the proposal that the matter should be left to be decided by those who have the public duty to pay this compensation out of the public funds is a wise one. It is very easy to be liberal with other people's money, and I think the matter ought to be dealt with by those who are responsible to Parliament, so that if they make any mistakes they can be called over the coals.<lb/>
I may be asked the very natural question why no provision is made in the Bill for compensation where tenancies are brought to an end under compulsory orders. The county councils have been obliged to use their compulsory powers in connection with something like 1,200 acres. I may be asked why, in these circumstances, the same indulgence is not to be given to those tenant farmers on whom compulsory orders have been issued. The answer to that is that in those cases the tenant can obtain full compensation under the Lands Clauses Acts, and therefore there is no reason to protect him in this Bill. That is all I have to say as regards this little Bill. I hope your Lordships will look as favourably upon it as the House of Commons did. It may be a very small Bill, but it perfects a work which will not only add to the social, moral, and physical welfare of the people at large, but will redound to the credit of the Parliament which passed it into law. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00435"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think there would have been some disappointment among the members of your Lordships' House, at any rate on this side, if we had not heard from the noble Earl opposite to-night a reiteration of the remarkable figures he has quoted on previous occasions of
<col>192</col>
the extension of small holdings in this country. But I rise for the purpose of congratulating the noble Earl on having brought in this Bill, because, as he is perfectly well aware, for it has been pointed out both in this House and in the other, there has been a great feeling of soreness left in the minds of tenant farmers in the country on account of land being taken away from them compulsorily, great damage being done to the remainder of their holding, and no provision being made for compensating them for the damage done. The noble Earl has now remedied that, and he has done it out of the source which I venture to think is the right and proper one &#x2014; namely, the Imperial Exchequer&#x2014;and not the rates which are levied by county councils.<lb/>
I was very glad to hear that the noble Earl had been impressed by the representations made to him that September 1 is rather short notice for those who may wish to proffer a claim where land has been taken from them before the commencement of the Act. I should like to draw the noble Earl's attention also to another point in connection with that clause, and that is that the "claim" must be sent in. I believe that by "claim" is meant the whole of the details of what the dispossessed tenant may consider to be the amount which ought to be paid to him as compensation, and I should like the noble Earl to consider, if he will, whether it would not be possible to substitute for the word "claim" the words "notice of claim." Whatever date may be fixed it should not be the claim that should be sent in by that time, but notice should be given to the Board of Agriculture that the dispossessed tenant intends to make the claim, and then a time should be stated in which the claim should be sent in.<lb/>
I have only one other observation to make, and that is to congratulate the noble Earl on making Clause 2 retrospective. I venture to hope that it will not be without some effect on the noble Earl himself, because we remember that some time ago the noble Earl entertained the House by telling us how he went down to a farmers' ordinary and made the observation to them, which was common property at the time, that a General Election was pending, and he added that he did not wish that they should go to that General Election
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0101"/>
<col>193</col>
with a bad taste in their mouth. So the noble Earl produced a fifty pound note out of his pocket, which, with that generosity which always characterises him, he gave to the unfortunate tenant farmer concerned. As this Bill is to be retrospective, I hope that the noble Earl will make some representation to that gentleman and get his fifty pound note back, because it is clear that the tenant will get the &#x00A3;50 out of His Majesty's Government, and the end of it will be, if the noble Earl does not get his money back, that this man will have the &#x00A3;50 from the Treasury and also the &#x00A3;50 from the noble Earl. I congratulate the noble Earl on the introduction of this Bill, and sincerely hope that your Lordships will pass it into law without further delay.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00443">Appendix X, page 8, gives the amounts which have been expended. There is one item, that of "Net general expenditure," which I do not understand. Apparently the land was purchased for &#x00A3;6,000 or a little more; but why has it been necessary to incur a general expenditure of &#x00A3;1,188 upon it? By the aid of this and other expenditure the rent of Vatersay is reduced from &#x00A3;350, which it paid as a farm, to &#x00A3;180 which the noble Lord proposes it should be rented at by the crofters in future. In the second place, there is an item, which your Lordships will see is called "Loss on sheep stock, &amp; c.," of &#x00A3;3,403 11s. ld. I hope that the "etcetera" is a very large sum and that it is larger than the loss on sheep stock, because the number of sheep which were taken over was not really large, and if &#x00A3;3,403, or anything approaching that sum, was lost upon sheep stock, then I do not think this country will be able to go on sheep farming at the same ratio. It is quite clear that you could not lose such a sum as &#x00A3;3,403 on a comparatively insignificant number of sheep, and therefore there must be some item or items of a considerable amount of which the word "etcetera" does not give us a very clear understanding. I wish to ask these two Questions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00444"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the details of the sum of &#x00A3;1,188 7s. 2d. under the heading of "Net general expenditure" are as follow: Law charges and clerk to the reference, &#x00A3;594 19s. 6d.; arbiters' fees, &#x00A3;188 17s. 6d.; stipend and Income Tax, &#x00A3;20 12s. 5d.; expenses in connection with keeping and the sale of the sheep stock, &#x00A3;372 6s. 0d.; sundry small items, &#x00A3;11 11s. 9d., making a total of &#x00A3;1,188 7s. 2d. The noble Earl next asks for information in regard to the "Loss on sheep stock, &amp; c.," which is put at a sum of &#x00A3;3,403 11s. ld. The loss attributable to sheep stock is approximately &#x00A3;1,800, of which sum, however, from information before me, I think &#x00A3;175 represents the half year's rent from Whitsunday, 1908, making the sum attributable to loss from sheep stock, &#x00A3;1,625.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00445"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Lord stated that some portion of this "net general expenditure" was in connection with sheep stock. Why should anything which refers to sheep

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00446"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl, I think, is confusing his two Questions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00447"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No, I was taking your answer. I understood you, in giving the items, to say that in one of the items there was a sum in connection with sheep.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00448"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The item which I gave as part of the total sum mentioned in the first of the noble Earl's Questions was the item of &#x00A3;372 6s. 0d., which represents expenses in connection with the sale of the sheep stock and therefore not attributable correctly to loss on sheep stock. They were expenses connected with the sale.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00449"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: Of the &#x00A3;3,403 loss on sheep stock, &amp; c., the noble Lord has accounted for &#x00A3;1,800, &#x00A3;175 of which represents rent, but he has not given any statement of what has been done with the rest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00450"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl, in his Question, asked how much of this sum was loss on sheep stock, and I thought it better and simpler to give the exact information asked for. If any other information is required, I will willingly give it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00451"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> then rose to ask the Secretary for Scotland the second series of Questions standing in his name&#x2014;<i>viz</i>.:
<ol>
<li>1. How many sheep were paid for by the Congested Districts Board as being on Vatersay Farm at Whitsunday, 1908; and what sum was paid for them.</li>
<li>2. How many sheep have since been sold; and what sum has been received for them.</li>
<li>3. Have the sheep on the Island of Sandray been sold, or agreed to be sold, to the Vatersay crofters; and, if so, on what terms.</li>
<li>4. Does the Congested District Board now own any sheep on the Old Vatersay Farm.</li>
<li>5. "What has been the total loss of the Board in connection with sheep in Vatersay, including the costs of the arbitration, all sums paid to the late tenant, and the legal and other costs incurred by the Board.</li></ol></p>
<col>196</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00452">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in the Report of the Congested Districts Board for Scotland no specific account is given of what has happened owing to this experiment in sheep farming, and therefore I have put down these Questions, which speak for themselves. The Report itself covers the period up to March 31. It is stated in the Report that the Island of Sandray has been assigned as grazing to the townships mentioned. It certainly was not assigned in the period embraced by the Report. I naturally concluded, from reading the Report, that the arrangements had been made and completed with the cottars; but as a matter of fact there was, I understand, a dispute between the Board and the crofters with regard to these sheep. The crofters wished to take them over, but the Board did not wish to give them over, and unless 1 am misinformed the dispute had not terminated by the first week in May, when the island was still in possession of the Board, and I do not know whether it is over now. I presume it is, and therefore I wish to ask whether the sheep on that island have been sold or agreed to be sold to the Vatersay crofters, and, if so, on what terms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00453"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The answer to Question 1 is 2,333, and the sum paid fur them was &#x00A3;3,158 14s. 5d. The answer to Question 2 is 2,378, including lambs, and the sum received for them was &#x00A3;1,863 10s. 3d. The reply to Question 3 is, Yes, to the crofters. They have been sold approximately at market prices, one-third of the price being paid down and the remainder in instalments of &#x00A3;1 per share per annum. The answer to Question 4 is, No. As to Question 5, it is difficult to separate the cost of arbitration in connection with sheep from that referable to other heads, but with that qualification I am able to say that the loss on dealings in sheep, as stated in reply to the former Questions, is approximately &#x00A3;1,800, including the half year's rent I mentioned, while the cost of arbiters and other legal charges amounts to &#x00A3;495.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00454"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I hold in my hand a copy of the former account between the Board and the tenant, and while I agree with the noble Lord with regard to the figure of &#x00A3;3,158, yet in my account the sheep paid for were only 1,302.</membercontribution></p>

<title>KILMUIR.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00456"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> rose to ask the Secretary for Scotland, with reference to the Congested District Board's Report&#x2014;</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00458" align="center"><i>Kilmuir</i>.</p>

<li>1. How much of the item. &#x00A3;27,628 7s. 2d. represents sheep stock.</li>
<li>2. Has the stock been sold to the settlers, and at what price.</li>

<li>7. Is any interest chargeable and paid upon the capital expended.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00460">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Questions I have on the Paper are somewhat similar to those asked by my noble friend Lord Camperdown, but they refer to the Kilmuir estate. There are certain items with regard to sheep that I am anxious to inquire about. The first item I wish to draw attention to is that of &#x00A3;27,628 7s. 2d. I want to know how much of that item represents sheep stock. It is certain that there has been a loss, and I should like to know the amount. In connection with almost every other estate the loss is shown, but there is no indication of the loss here. It is lumped in with other sums. The payments profess to be the net payments, and probably the price received for the sheep when sold may in this figure be deducted from the amount which the sheep cost. I hope the noble Lord will be able to tell me what the price given for the sheep was and what they were sold for, so that. we may calculate the loss.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00461">The figure of &#x00A3;31,123 17s. 8d. in my Question appears to be an increase of &#x00A3;4,000 since the last account. I ask in
<col>198</col>
my Question how much of this item represents arrears of rent. I have since found out that the figure is given in the account. It appears that in March, 1910, the arrears on this estate were &#x00A3;3,447, and if the noble Lord has the information with him I should be glad if he would let us know on what rental those arrears have arisen. In this particular Report. there is nothing to show what the rental of that estate is, but by going back to the Report of the year before last I see it stated that the rental of the estate is &#x00A3;1,577. If that figure is correct, it appears that although this estate has only been in possession of the Board for some four or five years the arrears have now accumulated to a sum equal to two years rental. That is, of course, a serious state of things, and I know that the Board regard the whole question of arrears in the western islands as a serious one, because they state in their Reports for the last two years&#x2014;
<quote>"In a scheme of State-aided creation of new holdings it is manifestly of the highest importance that the settlers should make punctual payment of the sums due by them. We regret to say that in the case of several estates the settlers, with some exceptions, are considerably in arrear. We thought it our duty to intimate that unless there was an immediate improvement in this respect, steps would be taken to enforce payment or to foreclose. The result of this notice has not been satisfactory, and we have had to take proceedings against certain selected defaulters who we have reason to believe could have met their obligations in a more satisfactory manner than thay have done."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00462">That statement appears word for word in both Reports, and I should be glad if the noble Lord could give information as to what the effect of taking proceedings against these selected defaulters has been, and whether, if they have not been successful, further steps are proposed to be taken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00463">The next item, "Works, repairs, &amp; c., &#x00A3;8,825 17s. 3d.," represents an increase of &#x00A3;4,000 over last year. I see in Appendix XI of the Report that the works carried out on this estate have amounted during the last year to &#x00A3;1,200, which leaves a balance of &#x00A3;2,800 for repairs, &amp; c. I ask the noble Lord whether that represents a normal expenditure on repairs. The cost of the repairs is about one and a-half years rental, and if that is to be the normal expenditure on repairs and upkeep it seems a very large one. An item on the credit side of the Report to which I wish to call attention is a sum of &#x00A3;46,187, which is entered as a deduction from the total
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0104"/>
<col>199</col>
expenditure. That includes "rents, &amp; c." The word "etcetera" appears in almost every entry in this Report. I should like to know what it includes besides rent. It possibly includes some repayment for sheep stock, although that would probably come in better as a deduction from the sum stated as the valuation of the stock. It may include interest on the expenditure, and it may also include annuities and repayment of loans if anything has been paid towards that purpose.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00464">But what I really complain of is that annual income and possibly capital income should be all lumped together and used as a set off towards the total expenditure on the estate. The expenditure consists of the purchase price of the Kilmuir estate, this sum for sheep stock, of which we have spoken, and various other things. These other items may be loans, or they may be ordinary upkeep, or possible free gifts; but what I want to bring before the noble Lord's notice is that if these are free gifts, as I anticipate a good many of them are, it is surely misleading to infer that they are paid off, because there can be very little necessity to pay off free gifts at all. If, on the other hand, they are loans, then it seems to me it is improper accounting to suggest that these loans are being repaid by sums which really are entirely on account of income. I suppose it is obvious that all payments on account of capital, other, of course, than free gifts, do require to show something in the way either of rent if it is a purchase price, or interest if it is a loan, before any part of the revenue can be allocated for capital purposes; and it seems to me really incorrect that you should make it appear in your accounts that your capital liabilities are being annually reduced by large sums when in reality a large portion of your receipts are obviously receipts on account of income, and ought not to be paid in reduction of capital. I think the system adopted might be made more clear to the ordinary observer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00465">I believe an alteration in this method of accounting would be very easy, and I ask the noble Lord to consider whether he cannot take into his consideration whether some other method cannot be adopted to make these accounts more clear. A large number of people are interested in this large experiment in the State management and State ownership of land. It is obvious
<col>200</col>
that in the western islands we are up against a problem which is of an entirely uneconomic nature. At the same time I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that we should be put into possession of facts so that we can see how uneconomic that problem has become, and be able to judge whether the vast expenditure now going on there does leave behind it benefits to the district and the crofters anything like commensurate with this large outlay of money.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00466"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord may rest assured that the Government are perfectly willing and ready to afford all the information in their possession with regard to these matters. I have to make two observations before I answer the Questions. But I hope your Lordships will not misunderstand me if, having been told by the noble Earl who put the first series of Questions that it is his intention to raise this subject as a whole for discussion in your Lordships' House at an early date, I reserve any discussion of the subject, so far as I am concerned, till I know exactly the purposes and wishes of noble Lords in regard to it. It seems to me very desirable that we should first get at the facts, and having got at the facts impartially and without controversy perhaps we shall be more able to discuss them.<lb/>
As the noble Lord has said, the system of keeping these accounts may possibly be peculiar. I am not prepared to say that I have not found considerable difficulty, in the wording of the noble Lord's Questions, at arriving at his meaning, so that possibly he may, in the same way, have found some difficulty in understanding the figures which are put before him. These Questions were put down on Thursday or Friday of last week. Therefore I have had considerable notice, and I have made every effort to obtain the information which the noble Lord desires. But at this time of the year the staff of the Board is employed in different parts of Scotland, and I have not yet got the full information for which the noble Lord asks under some of these heads. I can only say that I shall be very glad to add to it at his instance if he so desires. I ought also to make this general observation, that this estate of Kilmuir can hardly be judged by the ordinary canons. It was not purchased as a w hole and then handed over to tenants as a whole. It was purchased by the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0105"/>
<col>201</col>
Government of the day, I think in the year 1901 or 1902.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00467"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF HURLER</member><membercontribution>: No; I was not responsible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00468"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I forget the year; but it was purchased by the Government some time ago, and the condition of the estate, which was one of some congestion and in parts one of considerable confusion, required a thorough rearrangement of the razing belonging to the different tenants on the estate. It consisted of farms and of crofter townships. Same of these farms have been broken up to make new settlements of crofters, and a wholesale rearrangement of the pasture and the common grazing of these townships, which could only be carried out gradually and slowly, was necessary. Thus it is that we cannot give totals of some of the items in which the noble Lord is interested.<lb/>
The answer to Question 1 is &#x00A3;24,773 Os. 2&#x00BD; d. The answer to Question 2 is that most of the stock was sold at public sales. As to these, particulars are, I believe, obtainable, but I have nut got them before me to-day. In respect of such stock as was sold to the tenants I have this information: 1.630 sheep have been sold at a value of &#x00A3;1,529 to tenants. There is also a further number&#x2014;a smaller number&#x2014;of which I have not got the details and in regard to which the arrangements for sale ate not yet completed. It follows that the answer to Question 3 is that I am unable at the present moment to give the total loss on sheep stock, for it cannot be calculated. As to Question 4, the information which I have in regard to the arrears is contained in the published Report. I have no further information with regard to those arrears. I had thought that what the noble Lord wished to know was what arrears there were on the estate when it was purchased&#x2014;that is to say, what debt we took over when we purchased the estate. That figure is&#x00A3;1773</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00469"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: Is that included in the item of &#x00A3;31,123?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00470"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Part of it only. Part of it has been written off, I think, owing to arrangements made between the different townships. But I should not like to be positive on that point. In regard to arrears, the noble Lord will see there is a able of figures which shows the position of
<col>202</col>
the arrears at the present time. Steps are being taken in accordance with the statement contained in the Report, and I shall be very glad, on a future occasion, to state how the matter stands. In reply to Question 5, on my present information the increase over last year does represent a normal expenditure on repairs. The noble Earl made a reference to the Appendix in the Report. The heading there is "Works" and therefore when I give the noble Lord the figure of the repairs for which he asks in his Question, which is &#x00A3;350, it does not clash necessarily with the information he has taken out of the Report. I think light can be thrown on that by my further answers.<lb/>
In Question 6 the noble Lord asks how much of the sum mentioned represents rents and how much sinking fund. There is no sinking fund included, but the sum does include rents and sheep stock. At this moment I am not able to give the figures for each of those two separate heads, Finally, the noble Lord asks whether any interest is chargeable and paid upon the capital expended. Loans for buildings, for which the noble Lord will see a sum of &#x00A3;190 included in the Appendix, have recently been given, but the fixed time for the beginning of the repayment has not yet arrived. When it does arrive interest will be payable on those loans in regard to roads and fencing, which are made for the general improvement of the estate; and this, I think, comes under the criticism of free gifts which the noble Lord mentioned. On outlay for those purposes no interest is charged to the tenants, and in regard to the purchase price it also ought to be noted that the rents are crofting rents; the tenants are crofters, and therefore no element of interest, as I understand it, arises. I have given the noble Lord all the in formation I have at the present moment; but, as I have said, I shall be very glad to supplement it later at the noble Lord's instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00471"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: May I ask the noble Lord a question with regard to his answer to Question 6? The noble Lord is asked how much of the sum of &#x00A3;46,187 represents rents and how much sinking fund. He says rents are included, but he cannot say how much of that sum is repayment for sheep stock. This is rather unfortunate, because we do not know how to divide the two sums. Observe this, that whatever has been paid in the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0106"/>
<col>203</col>
form of rent is deducted from the capital outlay as if it were a repayment of capital. Surely that. is bad accounting. You have spent a sum of &#x00A3;140,000, you say, and you receive, we will say, &#x00A3;5,000 in rent. Then you put down that as if it is repayment of capital, but surely there ought to be some interest in the form of rent on an expenditure of &#x00A3;140,000. At this rate you have merely to go on receiving rent long enough to extinguish your capital. Surley that, on the face of it, must be wrong.</membercontribution></p>

I quite admit the intricacy and difficulty of the subject, but I do venture to say that if in some cases, at all events, it had been desired to obscure the real significance of the figures that operation could not have been more successfully achieved. The grouping is an unusual grouping&#x2014;a grouping with which, I venture to say, no one who is in the habit of studying State accounts is at all familiar. and the constant addition of that comprehensive little symbol "&amp; c." renders them more confusing still. You have in the Return relating to Vatersay a heading "Net general expenditure," which, as the noble Lord admitted, contains a considerable sum on account of loss on sheep stock, although the very next item is a separate one for loss on sheep stock. I venture to think that if your Lordships were to fill up some of those Returns which many of us are receiving from the Somerset House authorities at this time in an equally perplexing and ambiguous manner, we should be emphatically reminded that we were not performing the duties of citizenship as they should be performed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00473"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to make one suggestion. Unlike some of my noble friends on this side of the House, I have been through the mill of making this very Report in earlier days when it was not so large and comprehensive, and the suggestion I want to make touches the real point of whether these experiments are going to be successful or not. I was responsible for the purchase and for the divisions of three only of the groups of holdings mentioned in this Report&#x2014;Syre,
<col>204</col>
Barra, and Sollas and Grenitote. I should like to know how they are going on at the present time. Are the arrears accumulating? Because that is, to my mind, the crucial point in judging whether this policy is going to be successful or not.<lb/>
On such items as sheep valuation, those connected with Scotland knowing the difficulties must expect that there will he a less on taking over sheep stock and re-selling it in these days. There must be capital expenditure on new buildings; there must be grants for roads and bridges, and so on. What I think is of importance is that we should know, first of all, what the amounts of those are in the case of each of the estates, and we must regard that as sunk money for the purpose of giving the experiment a fair chance. I am most anxious to see the schedule of payments by those who are now holding. They enter into obligations to pay so much in rent, so much in sinking fund, and so much for return on their buildings, and I would like to see how these people are getting on. Are they year by year accumulating arrears, or are they, taking one year with another, meeting their obligations? There is no information in these documents which on a comprehensive scale shows what these tenants are doing.<lb/>
Take the case of Syre, the individual holdings of which are larger than any other. It is in one of the most favourable districts. It was an estate bought from the Duke of Sutherland, and it was distributed into somewhat larger holdings than the others. That has been going on now for ten or eleven years, and it would be useful if we could see a schedule for each year of what these individual tenants have done. The difficulty of the circumstance is this, that there may be some successful and some may fail. There may be difficulties with regard to individuals which have to be carefully considered. I never would be desirous of pressing a man unduly if there had been disease in his stock, or if he had had a bad year through any particular cause. But if it be the case that over all the estates, one year with another, the practice has grown up of arrears accumulating and no steps being taken, you are going on a course which cannot be justified from public policy, for the essential thing is that these people should be taught that if they enter into obligations they must be made to pay or to suffer. If you do not do that, you put a premium on recalcitrancy, and you eventually sap the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0107"/>
<col>205</col>
independence of these people and the possibility of the experiment being successful. Therefore I should like to see an amended account taking a few of the older estates, and I think we ought to have a progressive account with individual names, or at any rate individual holdings ought to be capable of being identified, to see what proportion of these people are meeting their obligations and what proportion are not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00474"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I frankly say that I agree entirely with what has fallen from the noble Lord. What. he has said correctly describes the policy of the Board in regard, not only to the tenants who have arrears, but to the much larger majority of the tenants who have no arrears. I have not got the details of the various estates with me on this occasion, or I would willingly give the information. There are 500 tenants on one estate, and there are ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty on other estates. I did not know the information would be sought for, and if t here had been a hint in the Questions on the Paper that a general discussion was invited I should have endeavoured to be ready to meet it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00476"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: No; the noble Earl prefers that a general discussion should be avoided. It is true that this settlement does require mercy, and the consideration which Lord Balfour suggests should be shown to enable these people to get over the first difficulties of bringing ground under cultivation in some cases and of making a home for themselves. But after that, in the case of men who arc really not doing their best to meet their obligations, your Lordships may be sure that the policy of the Board is not to allow to occur what the noble Lord fears&#x2014;namely, a leniency which would sap that independence and self-reliance which the Government should encourage in these men.<lb/>
May I say one word in respectful protest of the intervention of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition in this matter?

<col>206</col>
weight of his authority to criticisms which, with the greatest respect, I think have really not been deserved. These accounts, as the noble Marquess will see if he examines the Return, do not profess to be complete accounts. They are simply a brief summary of expenditure under each property which is administered by the Board. They have never professed to be complete accounts and to put before Parliament the 'details of management, profit and loss, capital and current account, and so forth. The form of the accounts has not been altered by me since I have been responsible for the Department. It has remained the same from the inception, and has not been questioned, I think, until to-day. I venture mildly to protest against the criticism of the noble Marquess for this further reason, that he seemed to imply that I wished to shelter&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

He suggested that the form of the accounts was not calculated to make obvious all the information which it was desirable that Parliament should have. I can assure him that any representations which come from any quarter of this House desiring an amendment of the form of the accounts or fuller information concerning them will be welcomed. It is all to the good that your Lordships should take an interest, if I may say so, in what is going on in Scotland in this matter, and there will be no one more ready than myself to meet criticism, however severe.</membercontribution></p>

My friends behind me confirm that view. But, as a matter of fact, these accounts did come before the House in a shape which fairly puzzled some extremely businesslike and acute critics who sit behind me, and I ventured to express my regret that they should not be presented in a form more intelligible. That was the beginning and end of my criticism.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE BREEDING OF LIGHT HORSES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00480"><member>LORD WYNFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether he can give any information as to the amount of the grant that may be expected from the Development Fund for the purpose of encouraging the breeding of light horses. I hardly expect that the noble Earl will be able to give this information, but I wish to bring the matter forward as I consider it one of urgency. Towards the end of last year the Hunters Improvement Society&#x2014;this society and the Hackney Society are the two most influential societies which interest themselves in horse-breeding in this country&#x2014;appointed a very strong committee, who spent a lot of time and went very carefully into the question of horse-breeding with a view of bringing out some scheme. In the late spring or early summer of this year they presented a report to the council, who ordered if to be printed, and I think a copy of that report was sent to each of your Lordships. I do not intend now to go into the merits of that scheme, beyond saying that I believe it is accepted on all hands as being an excellent and practical one. The noble Earl has told us that he also has a scheme ready, and I can only hope that his scheme, if not identical in detail with that of the Hunters Improvement Society, is at all events on the same lines. But whatever scheme is going to be put into operation, unless something is done very soon the whole of a valuable year will be wasted. Any scheme which includes the registration and examination of stallions, the registration and possible purchase of brood mares, in addition also to the appointment of committees, will take a long time to bring into operation, and it is essential, if it is to be brought into operation this year, that something should be done without delay. The noble Earl will probably tell me that he can do nothing himself, and that he is entirely in the hands of the Development Commissioners. I believe the Development Commissioners, who were appointed in April last, have not yet held a meeting. I do not know if the reason for this is that the Vice-Chairman, Sir Francis Hopwood, cannot be spared from his duties at the Colonial Office. However that may be, I am anxious to point out the necessity of getting some scheme into operation unless another year is to be wasted. I trust that if the noble Earl cannot answer my Question he will at least be able to
<col>208</col>
inform your Lordships that something is going to be done in this matter at an early date, and I hope he will use his influence in that direction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00481"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need hardly assure the noble Lord opposite that the Board of Agriculture are quite as anxious to bring this matter to a head as he is himself. I am also pleased to think that the able recommendation of the Hunters Improvement Society runs very much on all fours with the scheme that the Board of Agriculture have in view, and which I had the honour some time ago of explaining to your Lordships. I think we can congratulate ourselves that we have the entire sympathy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. There never was a Chancellor of the Exchequer in my recollection who was more sympathetic with the claims of agriculture. He has for the first time given us a grant of a quarter of a million towards the claims of the industry that I have the honour to represent. The Board are in close communication with the Development Commissioners, and I hope that it will not be very long before we shall come to some practical and satisfactory result. At the same time 1 think the noble Lord opposite will agree with me that it would be hardly fair on the Treasury or on the Development Commissioners that I should state at this moment what the exact sum is that I have asked the Development Commissioners for. I hope he will be satisfied with this answer, and with the assurance that nothing will be left undone so far as my Department is concerned to bring the horse supply of the country to a satisfactory position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00482"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have always recognised the anxiety of the noble Earl to do something in this important matter, but I think we really have shown the patience of saints and it is time we began to ask for a little more definite progress. The noble Earl will, I am sure, remember that this matter crystallised at a meeting which he called at the Board of Agriculture at the beginning of 1906, when we were definitely asked to produce a scheme for the Government to see. That scheme has been produced, and the Government told us last year that they, too, had a scheme. I cannot help expressing my disappointment that the noble Earl the President of the Board
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0109"/>
<col>209</col>
has not been able to answer the Question of my noble friend behind me, because, after all, this matter is urgent, and obviously it is desirable that some start should be made this summer. We who know the details of the Hunters Improvement Society's scheme know it to be an excellent one. The noble Earl tells us that in principle his scheme agrees with the scheme of the Hunters Improvement Society. I confess 1 should not have thought it unreasonable to ask that we should know at once the definite sum the Government propose to give to this definite service. If the noble Earl says he cannot give it, we cannot press for it; but I do seriously hope that progress may be made in the very early future, not progress in obtaining the sympathy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which we know we have got, but progress in seeing the colour of his money. I hope that at any rate before the adjournment for the recess the noble Earl may be able to tell us what sum may be expected for this import ant service.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FIELD ARTILLERY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00487"><member>THE EARL OF STRADBROKE</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary for War "whether be can give the date at which guns will be supplied to the Territorial Field Artillery to complete their proper number; also, if the guns for the Territorial Field Artillery will be supplied with dial sights
<col>210</col>
in place of the wooden arc sights, and, if so, when."</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00488">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I have put this Question on the Paper in the hope that the noble Lord the Under-Secretary will take this opportunity of telling us when the guns still required for the Territorial Artillery will be delivered. The howitzer brigades have only received about half the full number of guns. Naturally these brigades are becoming somewhat disheartened, as this will be the third training they have been called upon to carry through with only half their number of guns. The Territorial Artillery has come in for a good deal of criticism, and I, for one, do not regret it at all, because I feel that these criticisms are all made with a view to improving the present state of affairs. But I think the first thing to be done is to provide the Territorial Artillery with the necessary guns to make up their full complement. Those who had experience of the Volunteer Artillery will not dare to hope that the Territorial Artillery will be armed with any more modern guns than the latest cast off from the Regulars. The howitzer brigades are now waiting for the guns to be discarded by the Regulars. That brings out this other point, that while all the Territorial howitzer brigades are short of guns, a corresponding number of Regular batteries are armed with guns which in military circles are considered obsolete. Why there has been this long delay in supplying the howitzer guns I do not know, unless it is that the orders for the new howitzers for the Regulars have only recently been given, or that the guns cannot be turned out in a reasonable time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00489">I hope the noble Lord will also be able to say that the Territorial Artillery will be provided with dial sights in place of the old wooden arc sights, which are inconvenient and tend to make practice in artillery very slow. There is truth in the criticism that the Territorial Artillery are slow. The officers do not have the opportunities that officers in the Regulars have of observation of gun practice, and the horses they have to handle are practically unbroken for the work they have to do. Those are big difficulties that have to be faced. The matter of providing dial sights for the Artillery is not a large item, and I hope the noble Lord will be able to give a favourable answer to that part of my Question and also to the former part.</p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0110"/>
<col>211</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00490"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the unfortunate delay in issuing the full number of guns to the Territorial howitzer batteries is due to the fact that they are waiting for the guns which are at present in use by the Regular Artillery, and which are about to be replaced by the new howitzers. The issue of the new howitzers to the Regular Artillery will begin next month, and as those guns are issued the Regulars will give up their present guns and they will be sent without delay to the Territorial batteries. I am glad to say that there is no Territorial battery with less than two guns, and four batteries have their full complement of four guns. To the same cause is due the fact that the dial sights have not been issued to the Territorial Field Artillery. We intend to issue proper dial sights to them, and the wooden ones they are at present using are only intended to be used until we can issue to them the dial sights at present being used by the Regulars. I hope that before very long the Regular Artillery will be provided with new dial sights, and as soon as that is accomplished the dial sights which they are now using will be handed over to the Territorials. There is always an amount of uncertainty in connection with the manufacture of fine and exceedingly complicated mechanism, and I cannot give the noble Earl any answer as to the actual date when these sights will be delivered. But I can assure him that there will be no delay which can possibly be avoided in equipping the Territorial Artillery in this direction.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00641"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to call attention to the inadequacy of the Territorial Army for Home Defence in view of the opinion now prevalent among experts that the landing of a large hostile force is practicable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00642">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I see my noble friend Lord Dartmouth in his place. I listened with great interest to his speech a few days ago, and I hope your Lordships will not think I am wanting in courtesy if I do not go into such full details as did my noble friend on that occasion. I wish this evening to raise questions of principle rather than of detail. My noble friend concluded his speech by saying that what was wanted was an expert who would take the trouble to find out whether the Territorial Army would fulfil the purposes for which it was created and be worth the money which was paid for it. We know that approximately the cost of the Territorial Army is over &#x00A3;3,000,000, an expensive price to pay if it is to be a toy and not a reality, and therefore I entirely agree with the concluding words of my noble friend Lord Dartmouth's speech. What we have to consider is whether the Territorial Army is now capable of fulfilling the purposes for which it was created and whether it is worth the money we are now paying for it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00643">When I moved in your Lordships' House the Second Reading of the Territorial
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0117"/>
<col>225</col>
and Reserve Forces Bill I expressly stated that the chief military problem in our case then was not the defence of the United Kingdom so much as the defence of the Empire, and at that time the military problem was considered and was decided from this point of view. We looked at the military problem as a whole. Due weight was given to the peculiar conditions and characteristics of the Empire, to the fact that it is scattered all over the world, to its great length of front, and to that extent and in that respect to its peculiarly vulnerable condition. We did not forget to bear in mind that in Egypt and in India, where a small minority is governing a large number of people of other races, unforeseen complications might arise at any time, and that we ought to provide for those complications, whether in Egypt, in India, or elsewhere, by having a striking force capable of maintaining and upholding the interests of the Empire at large. For that purpose we proposed to create an Expeditionary Force of 166,000 men, and when my noble friend the Under-Secretary of State for War replies in the course of this debate I hope he will state explicitly whether we have now 166,000 men capable of being sent out on emergency at short notice and complete in all arms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00644">We established this Force of 166,000 men, and without going into the controversies that arose at the time, we converted the Militia into a Reserve for wastage in war and for service abroad. That was the part which our scheme played in relation to the maintenance of the Empire across the seas; but for Home Defence, for the protection of these shores, we relied upon the force and the power of the Navy. It was never contemplated then that a serious invasion was probable. It was thought that we might have to take some measures of protection against a raid. A raid of a buccaneering character, made, let us say, against one of our rich and unprotected towns on the south coast, would be an act which would probably alienate to a great extent civilised opinion, and would not, so far as the power of the Empire goes or the power of this country goes, have any formidable effect. It would undoubtedly be very disagreeable to the people who were the occupants of that town. The kind of raid which we thought probable and which a great Continental Power might make would be a raid upon one of our arsenals,
<col>226</col>
where, of course, they could, if they got in, in a very short period of time inflict an incredible amount of mischief. Against a raid of that kind we thought&#x2014;and I think with reason&#x2014;that we could, if invasion was not a probability, protect ourselves first and foremost through the Navy; then through our garrisons; and behind we were to have the Territorial Force with an establishment of 300,000 men. It is quite true that this Force was not to have serious training until it was embodied; but when once you admitted the view that serious invasion was not a probability, it was not unreasonable to say that in the event of a great war, one of long duration, you would have time to make out of that Force something which would be effective and really powerful.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00645">I am afraid I must ask your Lordships to listen to the words of Mr. Balfour, because they bear very closely upon the principles on which the Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill was introduced and supported by me in this House, and they contrast very strikingly with the present condition of things. In May, 1905, Mr. Balfour, speaking as Prime Minister and on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence, said&#x2014;
<quote>"is it possible to land 70,000 men on these shores? We have not gone into generalities about the command of the sea or the superiority of our Fleet, or this difficulty or that difficulty."</quote>
Mr. Balfour at that time was supposing that we were at war with France. He continued&#x2014;
<quote>"We have endeavoured to picture to ourselves a clear issue which is very unfavourable to this country, and I have shown that on the most unfavourable hypothesis serious invasion of these islands is not an eventuality which we need seriously consider.''</quote>
That was the view of the Prime Minister speaking on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and that was the official view which then held the field. But, my Lords, what is the official and authoritative view to-day? The present Prime Minister, speaking on July 29 last year, again not only as Prime Minister but on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence, made use of this language in the House of Commons&#x2014;
<quote>"With regard to the military aspect, it is, in consequence of the finding of this Committee [the Defence Committee], the business of the War Office to see that we have under all circumstances&#x2014;</quote>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0118"/>
<col>227</col>
I beg your Lordships to note those words, "under all circumstances "&#x2014;
<quote>"a properly organised and properly equipped Force capable of dealing effectively with a possible invasion by 70,000 men."</quote>
That is the view to-day of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and it is diametrically opposed to the view stated by Mr. Balfour in 1905. Mr. Balfour dealt with a possible invasion of 70,000 men. He said then that that was not within the limits of probability. Mr. Asquith now says&#x2014;and the Secretary of State for War is also a member of that Committee and therefore the Prime Minister is speaking also on his behalf&#x2014;Mr. Asquith says to-day, and his language is very peremptory and very direct, not a mere expression of opinion, that it is the business of the War Office to see that we have, under all circumstances, such a Force as he mentioned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00646">Now, my Lords, that brings me to the sole and only point which I wish to bring before your Lordships' House this afternoon. Is the War Office providing us with such a Force? Have we in the Territorial Army a Force capable of resisting under all circumstances an invasion of 70,000 Continental troops? I am anxious not to obscure the main. issue by small details, but seeing my noble friend the Under-Secretary of State in his place, I should like very much, if he were able when he rises to give it, to have information with regard to the following points. First of all, how many men of the Territorial Army (the strength of which is now, approximately, 260.000) whose time. expired on June 30&#x2014;I understand that, roughly speaking, about 65,000 men were liable to this condition&#x2014;how many of those men have re-engaged? Is he able to give any approximate figure in that respect? Secondly, how many, if any, Regular batteries are allotted to the Territorial Force in time of war? Thirdly, what practice have the officers and men of the Territorial Field Artillery had with the guns? The figures of the men in the Territorial Field Artillery who have been in camp eight or fifteen days respectively are lumped together with the Infantry, and I cannot disentangle the one from the other. I hope my noble friend will be able to answer those questions. Then I want to know how many horses are allotted to the Territorial batteries. I do not know what my noble friend may be able to say about that; but it has been my lot to
<col>228</col>
have a great number of Regular Artillerymen camping in my park during the last few weeks as a resting place between Aldershot and Bulford, and I learned almost universally from every one to whom I have spoken that, so far from there being any horses to allot to the Territorial Artillery, the Regular batteries are themselves very short of horses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00647"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: May I ask what the noble Earl means by the word "allot" in that context?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00648"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: How many horses are provided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00649"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Do you mean in establishments? Does the noble Earl ask what is the establishment of horses for Territorial batteries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00650"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I mean in organisation for war&#x2014;whether the horses are there, whether they exist. I must call your Lordships' attention, not in any great detail, to the leading main facts which we have extracted from my noble friend in regard to the condition of the Territorial Army to-day; and it must be borne in mind that the question we now have to ask ourselves is whether this Army is capable of resisting an invasion of 70,000 picked Continental troops. I am afraid that when you investigate the figures and the conditions the Territorial Army hardly comes up to the high standard which was expressed by my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War at Newcastle, when he stated that a nation in arms was the only safeguard for the public interests. What are the figures which the noble Lord the Under-Secretary gave to the House in reply to certain questions which I put to him in March of this year? He told us that out of 260,000 non-commissioned officers and men then serving&#x2014;the date he gave was October 1, the latest date up to which he had the figures&#x2014;98,306 were under twenty years of age, and that out of this total of 260,000 men. 163.000 only had attended even the limited drill of fifteen days in camp. To my mind these are striking and appalling figures, and they become much more striking and remarkable in the light of the very much higher task and the very much higher duties now imposed on the Territorial Force by the present Prime Minister and by the Committee of Imperial Defence.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0119"/>
<col>229</col>
I come now to the question of musketry. We hear a great deal about interest and enthusiasm; but however enthusiastic, however patriotic, may be the Force which is to fight for the freedom of this country against invasion, that Force will not he very effective unless it has at least the power to shoot. What is the position as regards musketry? My noble friend, in the course of the discussion to which I have referred, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The firing of twenty-three rounds of miniature ammunition is not a standard we recognise. I cannot say how many have passed this standard, but I know there are seven battalions of Infantry and 50 per cent. of ten other battalions who have not been able to fire a single shot at an open range."</quote>
If my noble friend brought out those very striking facts in order to strengthen public opinion in regard to obtaining more ranges and persuading the House of Commons to provide more money, that may be. But, on the other hand, it emphasises how extraordinarily inadequate this Force is to perform the duties which are now going to be imposed upon it.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, can we rely for the defence of the country on the Territorial Field Artillery? A great deal has been made of the excellent work done by the Honourable Artillery Company and by Elswick's batteries in the South African war; but, with due respect, I venture to maintain that the good work that was done by those batteries is no guide as to the value generally of the Volunteer Field Artillery. I see the distinguished Field-Marshal (Earl Roberts) in his place, and I think he will bear me out when I say that, after all, these batteries were never opposed by highly trained Artillery, and, moreover, these batteries were trained for three months in the field before they were engaged with an enemy at all. Then it must be borne in mind that the Honourable Artillery Company and Elswick's batteries had special advantages. I do not know whether my noble and gallant friend Lord Denbigh is in the House this afternoon, but I am sure he will support that, statement, because he will be anxious to recognise the great assistance which the Royal Horse Artillery have been able to confer upon the Honourable Artillery Company by lending them the advantages of the use of their riding school. The Honourable Artillery Company also have in their <i>personnel</i> men of means who can
<col>230</col>
expend both time and trouble in drills and training. And as regards the Elswick batteries, they, of course, were largely composed of trained artificers. I maintain that you cannot take the work done by these batteries and put that forward as any reason for establishing a general system of Territorial Field Artillery, or for supposing that Volunteer Field Artillery of that kind, who have had no practice in shooting, no practice in visualisation, will be competent to deal with the trained Artillery of a Continental army. Whatever there is of the Territorial Field Artillery, I am bound to say it is a Force which, as regards strength, is somewhat wrapped in mystery. And it is upon the Territorial Force that the Prime Minister has imposed the duty of resisting an invasion by 70,000 Continental troops.<lb/>
It may be said that no such duty has been imposed upon the Territorial Force. I presume that the whole of the military problem has to deal with an existing state of war. I will presume that there are obligations in Egypt or in India which demand that we should send out of this country our Expeditionary Force. If we have these 166,000 men ready to send and fit to go, I maintain that if they are sent abroad you practically skin the Regular Army, and what remains? Nothing remains in this country except the Territorial Force. No human being, least of all the politicians, can tell when war is likely to break out. Some of the older members of your Lordships' House may remember Lord Granville coming down to this House in July, 1870, with all his accustomed <i>bonhomie</i> and charm. He had just succeeded, on the death of Lord Clarendon, to the Foreign Office, and he told your Lordships that he was glad to say that he had had an interview with Mr. Hammond, the long-experienced Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. And what did Lord Granville say? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. Hammond had told him that during his long experience he had never known so great a lull in foreign affairs."</quote>
That statement was made in your Lordships' House on July 11. On July 19, eight days afterwards, war was declared between France and Germany. It is clear that this country, with its responsibilities all over the world, is liable to attack, is liable to differences with other countries, at any time; and, my Lords, the strength
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0120"/>
<col>231</col>
of our diplomacy is measured by the strength of our force and of our power to maintain our diplomacy. There are some in this country who, because they have many votes, have, I am afraid, much influence upon a certain class of politicians, and who would be surprised and aggrieved, rather like the fat doctor in the robbery in Oliver Twist, that any such action should he taken without notice and unexpectedly. As if, as Charles Dickens said, gentlemen who are engaged in the business of housebreaking are in the habit of giving notice by the twopenny post and commencing their operations at noon. An invasion, if it came upon us, would come suddenly. Surely the language of the Prime Minister, unless the Committee of Imperial Defence is not to be taken as a serious institution at all, must be very seriously regarded.<lb/>
I listened to a speech from my noble friend Lord Derby a night or two ago, in the course of which he struck a note of grave anxiety. He admitted&#x2014;and no one is willing to admit it more fully than I do&#x2014;that as an organisation, as a skeleton, the Territorial scheme is infinitely better than the haphazard old arrangement which prevailed before it. But; my Lords, the noble Earl was also impressed by the fact, no doubt having regard to the findings of the Committee of Imperial Defence, that the real point we have to consider now is, Can we make the Territorial Army capable of fulfilling the heavy duty which is going to be imposed upon it? The noble Earl suggested that it would give him much relief, and I presume would give the country much relief, if the members of the Army Council would individually sign a paper to the effect that they thought the Territorial Army capable of fulfilling the purpose for which it is now intended. I do not suppose for one moment that any such document as that will ever be extracted from any Government, and I am not quite sure whether my noble friend was not talking a little with his tongue in his cheek when he was making that proposal, because, after all, the Army Council practically means the Secretary of State. I do not wish to speak with the slightest disrespect of them individually, but the Army Council are the creatures of the Secretary of State for War. Under the present arrangement and under present conditions I do not see how they can possibly be otherwise. The Secretary of State is not bound to bring all questions before the Army Council,
<col>232</col>
but can withdraw certain questions from their consideration. He can send for any member of the War Office, outside the question of whether he is on the Army Council or not, to talk over questions connected with different details of the administration of the Army. The Secretary of State is responsible for the Army, and practically all Secretaries of State have done this and will do so as long as the present arrangement lasts.<lb/>
I do not wish to throw any red herring across the line regarding the efficiency of the Territorial Army, but the remark made by Lord Dartmouth and the proposal put forward by my noble friend Lord Derby all echo a great want of confidence and a great cause of anxiety in the minds of the public. I do say that, with all that can be said for and against it, our military system suffers because we have no man of distinction, no great soldier, as we have had in the past, who can speak for the Army as a whole. We have, it is true, very distinguished military members of the Army Council, but they cannot speak for the Army as a whole; and if my noble friend Lord Dartmouth's suggestion meant anything at all, it must have implied that he would like to see a great soldier, a great organiser, a man of great practical experience in the field, a man like Lord Kitchener, placed in the position of being able to give advice to the Secretary of State for War. Whatever the future may bring forward, I do regret most deeply that we cannot make some really effective use of Lord Kitchener's services. I do not believe that you will ever get the public really to have confidence, or that the Army will have confidence, in the administration of the War Office until in some shape or form you get the services of a man who can speak for the Army as a whole, and who can be in conference and in consultation with the Secretary of State.<lb/>
I do not want to revive old questions, but I would refer to the success of the German military system in the war against France. It is quite true that France and Russia both suffered because their military system was tainted by Court influence, and persons were promoted by social and other considerations; but I draw an enormous distinction between the influence of a Court and the influence of a Sovereign. On the other hand, where there are, as there were in Germany, first-class soldiers, men of experience, men who had the confidence of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0121"/>
<col>233</col>
the Army, and men who were known to have the confidence of the country, and where they were trusted and loyally trusted as was the case with the old Emperor William, you had the most excellent military results. And you must remember this, that when Bismarck decided that a war was necessary to consolidate the unity of Germany, he was able to act upon the advice of the two great soldiers who he knew would give him an absolutely reliable as well as an honest opinion. I ask, Is there any person at the present; moment, in case of diplomatic difficulties or diplomatic troubles, whom the Minister of the day could go to and ask whether it was an occasion when he could press his point, or whether, because we were weak, lie had better get out of the trouble as well as he could through the best diplomatic surrender lie could to save our face?<lb/>
My noble friend the Under-Secretary of State for War has asked us not to keep pulling up the roots to see how the plant grows. I have no desire to do that. I should not wish to disturb the gradual evolution and development of the Territorial Army. All the occasion, all the necessity, has been brought about, not by, criticisms here or criticisms there, but by the deliberate opinion of the Prime Minister himself. It is perfectly obvious that one of two things must happen. If we are confronted to-day by a great Continental Power, we must either sacrifice the interest of our Empire abroad or the safety of the capital at home. Under present circumstances and having regard to the recent finding of the Committee of Imperial Defence, I am certain that public opinion would never allow the Expeditionary Force to leave these shores. I must apologise to your Lordships for having occupied longer time than I expected, and I can only say in. conclusion, that unless what we hear to-day of swaggering talk about the greatness and magnificence of our Empire is mere gas and gush, as indeed a great deal of it is, we ought honestly to face the facts of the situation and be prepared to pay the cost of Empire. We ought to be prepared to provide an Expeditionary Force to uphold our interests across the seas; and we ought also to provide what no military expert will tell us we have within measurable degree&#x2014;an efficient and effective force to resist a possible invasion of 70,000 men</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00651"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that on this side of the House we have any special reason to complain of this subject being raised by the noble Earl this afternoon. The question of the defence of the Empire is clearly of the highest importance. That there should be a public vigilance directed towards this subject is only natural, and if the result of this debate should be to clear up some misconceptions and to remove some of the anxieties to which the noble Earl referred, I think it will have had its value.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, speaking in this House the other day, deplored the necessity of these debates, which he thought were injurious to the public interests, but I observed that in deploring their necessity he was not deterred from selecting from among all the possible criticisms which might be directed against our military system that which, if true, would be the most damning of all. He challenged the fact that we now possess a more considerable force for expeditionary purposes than had existed in, I think he said, the year 1905, and he attributed the debates in which he took part to the provocative attitude of the Secretary of State for War, who he said had been guilty of what amounted, I think his words were, to a criminal speech at Guildford, and he seemed to take us to task altogether for the statements which emanated from the Secretary of State. I think if the noble Viscount will look at the official papers on this subject he will see that we have a gain of about 80,000 men&#x2014;I think the figure was 80,000, not 90,000&#x2014;over the position in 1905. The figures supplied to me have, I think, been circulated, and they show that, whereas in 1905 we only had an Army of 185,000 men available for foreign service, we have at the present moment 265,000, or 80,000 more, and when the normal is reached we shall also have 265,000.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00656"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Our differences about figures are most deplorable.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00657"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The figures which I have given comprise Regulars serving, the Regular Reserve, and the Special Reserve. I think what has misled the noble Viscount is this. He no doubt recalls the fact that there has been a reduction in the Regular Army since 1905&#x2013;6 of 25,900 men, but there has been an increase of 69,000 Special Reservists and an increase of 34,000 Regular Reservists over the establishment for which Mr. Arnold-Forster was responsible in 1905. The then establishment of the Regular Reserve was 104,000. The effective strength now, not the establishment, is 134,000, so that there is a gain of at least 30,000 Regular Reservists. So that if you deduct from the gain the loss of 26,000, you will see that on those two items alone there is a net gain of 77,000 men liable for foreign service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00658"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: In the remarks I made the other day I specially deprecated treating these matters merely from the point of view of what you could see on paper at the moment.

LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Having questioned the statement of the Secretary of State for War, the noble Viscount said it was provocative and criminal, and that is the challenge to which I am replying. I think we have been able to show that, although there has been a reduction in the number of Regulars serving, there has been a great increase in Special Reservists and Regular Reservists liable for foreign service. Behind many of the arguments we have heard to-day and on previous occasions there seems to lurk the figure of
<col>236</col>
our old friend, compulsory service. Compulsory service is not the policy of His Majesty's Government, for two very good reasons as it seems to me. In the first place, I do not believe the country would be prepared to accept the obligation of compulsory service except as the result of one of those national disasters to which noble Lords point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00660"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: It would not be of much use then.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00661"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I admit it would not be of much use after the event, but I would point out to noble Lords that, instead of admonishing His Majesty's Government on the subject, what they have to do is to educate public opinion. it is no good saying that we ought to have universal training if it is a well-known fact that the country does not intend to have it. There is another and stronger reason. It is that if more money is to be spent on national defence that money had much better be spent on the Navy than on the Army. I have always belonged to what is known as the Blue Water School, and I believe it is to our Navy that we must look for our real defence. I gather that the criticism of the noble Earl who raised this debate is directed to what he considers the inefficiency of our military system to perform the tasks which are thrown upon it, but I was not able to make out very clearly whether he falls foul of the principle or of the details of the present scheme. It is true that he said it was the principle that be attacked, but the main portion of his speech was directed to picking boles in the musketry, to the want of horses, and to other smaller details in the Territorial Army.</membercontribution></p>

LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Then I understand that what the noble Earl attacks is the general principle of the military organisation, and he questions whether it is fit to resist possible attack. It seems to me that any criticism upon our existing military organisation can only be explained by a failure to really grasp the inter-relation that exists between the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0123"/>
<col>237</col>
military and naval problems. What we have to consider is not so much whether we are able to repel invasion as whether we have in this country a sufficient Force to deter an enemy attempting invasion except in such force as could not escape the vigilance of the Navy. That is our problem, and to overlook that even for a single moment is to lose sight of the unique strategic position of this country. Our Home Defence Army&#x2014;in fact, the whole of our military organisation&#x2014;is not so much designed to fight a pitched battle on these shores with an invading army, as by its existence to grant mobility and freedom to our Fleet; that is to say, to prevent our ships from becoming mere coast guards round our shores. How far has that object been attained? In the first place, we have at the present time a Regular Army, a First Line, and I say incidentally that it is the first time in the modern military history of this country that we have had a First Line, consisting of the Regular Army. For the first time provision has been made for the waste of war; and noble Lords opposite know very well from their own experience that an Expeditionary Army winch does not make provision for that purpose is in no sense of the term a real First Line.<lb/>
The noble Earl says that it is all very well to have a Regular Army, but that when the Expeditionary Force has left these shores there will be little of the Regular Army left in this country. It is quite possible that you may be engaged upon some operation which would necessitate the Expeditionary Force leaving these shores. But the Expeditionary Force does not exhaust the whole of the Regular Army; the six Divisions which are designed for this purpose do not exhaust the whole of the Regular Army. In the first place, there are all those details which are unallotted. Then there are also the whole of the Special Reserve. Let us consider what will be the composition of the Special Reserve on an outbreak of war, when the Expeditionary Force had left. It would contain besides the Special Reservists trained under the old Militia system or a system similar to the old Militia system, all those Regular soldiers who for one reason or another had not been sent abroad with their units&#x2014;all the immature soldiers who fall back upon the third battalions. Noble Lords know that the principle of mobilisation is this: the Regular Reserve
<col>238</col>
is called out, they make up the second battalion <i>cadres,</i> and all the immature soldiers fall back on the third battalions. That in itself would be a considerable force, made up to a large extent by Regular troops. It is a mistake to suppose that because a soldier is under twenty-one years of age and consequently immature for foreign service, especially in tropical climes, he is not a trained soldier. On the contrary, very often he is just as much a trained soldier as those who serve with battalions abroad. Here we have a very considerable Force. It is true that they are not a mobile Force, but, as noble Lords know, there is a scheme of coast defence, and, as noble Lords also know, it is to those coast defence purposes that these troops are allotted. So that over and above the whole of the Special Reserve, made up as I have described, we have the Territorial Army, the fourteen Divisions; and they are a mobile Army possessing the complete organisation of a military force in every respect. I admit that they are not up to the numbers which we aim at, but still, as far as they go, they are a complete military organisation&#x2014;it is true only a partially-trained military organisation&#x2014; capable of taking the field with all the transport and all the other auxiliary services.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00664"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: Including horses?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00665"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: And including guns?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00666"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Including everything. I am dealing now with the principle. It is easy to point out certain defects of detail. They must inevitably occur in a Force which has been in existence for only two years. It could not be expected to have reached the complete perfection which it will undoubtedly eventually achieve. But I may point out to the House, with great respect, that we do possess this complete military engine. What we have to consider is whether a Force composed in this way is sufficient to deter the invasion of this country by an army of less than a considerable size. That figure has been mentioned at 70,000, and I do not understand that the noble Earl challenged the 70,000 figure. That was, as he well knows, fixed by the Committee of Imperial Defence after a most elaborate investigation, and I understand that the figure is not challenged. We say
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0124"/>
<col>239</col>
that this Force is capable of performing those duties. It is unreasonable to suppose that at the outbreak of war those who are responsible for our military position would be so imprudent as to court invasion by uncovering our coasts to any dangerous or serious extent<lb/>
The House must remember that the real danger period with regard to this country is the first six months, because after six months embodiment the Territorials, by general admission, will have gained an amount of military efficiency which will make them far more formidable than they can hope to be at the present moment. It is going a long way to suppose that at the outbreak of war the whole six Divisions of our Expeditionary Force would have left this country, that the whole of the Navy would have got completely out of touch with home waters, gone right away, apparently, and left the invasion of these shores an absolutely easy and practicable matter, and that the Territorial Force would be in a disorganised and incomplete condition. It was stated last year in this House by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition that the occurrence of those three conditions was extremely unlikely. That is the view which the Government take upon the matter. I think it is a mistake to suppose that the Territorial troops would be incapable of offering serious opposition to an invading army. I know there are those people who think that the value of Militia as against trained Regular troops can be disregarded. It certainly was the opinion of General George Washington, and he had considerable experience of the value of Militia troops; but I am not sure that the view would be borne out by those who remember, and especially those who served in, the South African war. The great advantage which the modern military rifle gives to these troops on the defensive was certainly not recognised before the South African war, and my own feeling is that it is quite possible to under-estimate the value of Territorial troops for defensive purposes. At any rate, we do not rely by any means upon what may be called the military efficiency of the Territorial Force to repel an invasion; we rely upon them. mainly to force the invasion of this country by so considerable a body of men as cannot escape the notice of our agents abroad and of those responsible for our naval administration.<lb/>
<col>240</col>
It seems to me inconceivable that a very large body of men can possibly be assembled and landed on these shores without arousing our attention. Take the matter of transport alone. Large ships would be required for that, and at any rate there would be a body of men which could not possibly be assembled without its coining to the attention of the Navy. We claim that we have by our Territorial Force achieved our object, and made it necessary for any nation seriously intending to invade this country to come in very considerable force. We believe that the Navy is the arm to which we are to look for protection from such an invasion, and we are sure that we are able to rely upon them in that respect. I have only attempted to deal, imperfectly I am afraid, with a few of the points raised by the noble Earl in his speech, and I will leave it to much abler hands to continue the discussion from these Benches.</membercontribution></p>

In addition to that, we have a Special Reserve. But the noble Lord plumed himself at the beginning of his speech upon the fact that the Special Reserve comprised a body of men formed to make good the waste
 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0125"/>
<col>241</col>
in the Expeditionary Force, so that those men have already disappeared. Then, thirdly, there are the immature men who are not fit to send out to defend their country in foreign climes. The noble Lord has put those forward as an adequate defence for the United Kingdom; but they are in no sense a body of men who could be depended upon to take organised action against an invader. So the noble Lord falls back on the Territorials, whom lie describes, much, I think, to the amazement of anybody who has anything to do with the Territorials, as being mobile in every respect. I should like him to tell me this Have they horses? Have they wagons? Have they boots? Have they even in; some instances guns? Have they reserve ammunition? Have they camp equipment of any sort or kind? My Lords, to describe the Territorial Force as a mobile one is surely the greatest exaggeration that has ever been applied in this House to this particular Force. It is mobile in no respect whatever. I would defy the noble Lord at the present moment or the Secretary of State to mobilise, as a Regular Division is mobilised, one single Division of the Territorials, much less the fourteen Divisions which the noble Lord thinks will be ready to defend the country against an invader. I am not going to deal with many of the figures which the noble Lord gave. I honestly confess I do not understand them in the very least. He talks of there being 185,000 men in 1905, and of there being 265,000 men in 1909. I think, if 1 may say so, he has made a mistake in the figures, and that what probably he will find is that whereas in the total for 1905 the Militia were not included, in 1909 he has included the Special Reserve.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00673"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: Quite so, and the Special Reserve is the Militia under another name, only rather worse trained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00674"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the noble Earl again? The -Militia were never liable for foreign service, whereas the Special Reserve are. That makes a great difference.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00675"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: I am not sure that it is not rather hair-splitting to say it; but they always went. I quite agree
<col>242</col>
the noble Lord has got that point. But it is rather begging the question, is it not? to put into your present scheme, as efficient, men who are exactly the same as the old Militia with the exception that they do not have nearly as much training as the old Militia did?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00676"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: On the contrary, they have more.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00677"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: In addition, the noble Lord spoke about the large increase of the Reserve. I think I am right in saying that the large increase of the Reserve is a great deal due to the 3-years system which was instituted for a certain time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00678"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: You cannot leave it out of account.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00679"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree. But I think the noble Lord will agree that the large increase of this Reserve, formed as it was by the 3-years system now done away with, is a rapidly decreasing force. The noble Lord shakes his head. Will he contradict me?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00680"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I do, because there will only he a reduction of 4,000 men in the Reserve when the normal is reached. That is the only reduction there will be, so that it is nothing material.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00681"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will make a little further inquiry he will find, as a matter of fact, that there will be a very much larger number by, say, the year 1915.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00682"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl make that good?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00683"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: I have not got the figures here, but I will write to the noble Lord and make it good. Now I want to deal with the question as to invasion. The noble Lord seems to assume that the figure of 70,000, which has been taken as a probable number, is the number that would invade this country, we baying lost command of the sea. But, as a matter of fact, the 70,000 is the number of men who could be landed in this country while we still have command of the sea. It is to meet not a maximum number, which would be any number if we did lose such command, but a minimum number
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0126"/>
<col>243</col>
of 70,000 who could be landed even with our command of the sea still being held. Let the House look at how the figure grew to 70,000. If they will recognise what a change has come over the Defence Committee in a few years, I cannot help thinking that they will have the same feeling of unrest and alarm that I personally have. First of all, 10,000 was to be the utmost limit. Two years before that, I think I am right in saying, a dinghy's crew was suggested; so that you get from a dinghy's crew to 10,000, and then from 10,000 to 70,000. Is 70,000 the figure that holds good at the present moment? Does the noble Lord see no chance of that figure in the immediate future being in any way increased, thereby rendering the necessity for a Territorial or Home Force even greater than it is at the present moment? The noble Earl who introduced this debate was the Minister in charge of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill when it came before your Lordships' House, and he has told us, on his authority, that the Force as then constituted was the minimum required to meet the possible number of invaders at that moment. In other words, the Territorial Force, not even now up to its strength, was calculated on a basis of resisting an invasion of 10,000 men, whereas the number has now grown to 70,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00684"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I do not accept the noble Earl's authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00685"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: Does it not, at all events, make us wish to find out whether this Territorial Force, formed three years ago with a view of resisting a comparatively small number of invaders, is qualified and sufficient to resist the largely increased number that the Defence Committee now think possible? As I said before, I am not one of those who wish to decry the Force at all. I believe there are great possibilities in it; but I do want to find out what the real opinion of the military authorities is with regard to the Force at the present moment. Within the next three months the present Associations will come to an end, and those of us who have worked for the last three years and who may be purposing to continue the work, have a right to know whether our efforts in the past have had a sufficiently satisfactory result as to justify our continuing in the future. I am afraid I cannot accept the noble Lord as a military
<col>244</col>
authority. What we want for this House and for the country at large, and more especially for those who either in the ranks or in other ways have contributed to the success as far as it has gone of the Territorial Force, is to get in writing from members of the Army Council some assurance that they are satisfied that as regards numbers, efficiency, and mobility, this Force is adequate to meet the 70,000 men whom the Government themselves admit may, even with our command of the sea, be landed on these shores.<lb/>
The noble Earl said that I probably spoke when I asked for this assurance with my tongue in my cheek. I assure him that I did nothing of the kind. I am most anxious to get this declaration. He said that probably we will not be able to get it because every member of the Army Council is a creature of the Secretary of State for War. I will not dispute his knowledge of the Army Council, and I may say, if I may, that I agree with him. But there is one man who is certainly not a creature of the Secretary of State for War, and yet whose opinion I think the House would accept as really authoritative, and that is Lord Kitchener. He is not now employed, and if the noble Lord could see his way to let Laid Kitchener inspect these various Territorial troops in camp, as they will be within the next month, and let him make a report on their efficiency, I for one, if that report is perfectly satisfactory, should have nothing more to say as against the present system. But do not let the noble Lord think that we can be put off with an assurance that this Force is efficient, provided it gets six months for training first of all. I endeavoured the other day to show how ridiculous such an idea was, how futile it is to think that a foreign nation would give you that time to prepare a stick for their own backs. Of course they will not do that. Whereas you might get this six months time before a raid of 70,000 was made, 10,000 men might be got together very rapidly and sent across; and you may be perfectly certain that you will not get six months warning before an attempt is made to land 10,000 men on these shores. Therefore I repeat my two questions of the other day. I ask the noble Lord to give me a definite and authoritative statement from either the military members of the Army Council or from Lord Kitchener; and I further ask whether he is prepared now to say that the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0127"/>
<col>245</col>
figure of 70,000 men as the maximum number that could be landed on these shores in case of an invasion is the number that still holds the field. I sincerely hope the noble Lord will give me a satisfactory answer to both those questions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00686"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only wish to make one observation. The noble Lord opposite said the fact of its being necessary to assemble an invading army would make that operation known in this country. I think it is a great fallacy to believe that it is necessary to assemble an army before an invasion can take place. An army can easily be embarked at different ports and can meet at a prearranged time and place at sea. Furthermore, very few of the large foreign barracks are more than three miles from a railway station. It would therefore be easy to have a large number of men at sea before we knew anything about it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00687"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I endorse the congratulatory observations made by Lord Derby on the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers. I am sure on this side of the House we welcome all speakers on the other side on the subject of the Army, because we so seldom bear anything except from Lord Lucas and the Lord Privy Seal on that subject. We have the greatest difficulty, therefore, in arriving at any new matter. The noble Lord who has come forward to-day to defend the case of the Territorial Army has given us much food for reflection, and I think not a small amount of material that we would like to have more thoroughly thrashed out. I am not going to follow the noble Lord into what we sometimes call on the Back Benches that well-known juggle of figures with regard to the Militia. I am quite aware that if you take the figures you can get most alarming results. It is really a curious fact that while one side say the number of the Expeditionary Force has been increased by 70,000, the other side say it has been decreased by 90,000, so that we get a difference of something between 100,000 and 200,000 men on the part of competent military authorities on both sides.<lb/>
I do not intend to follow the noble Lord in that, but I would like to point out that in order to have an Expeditionary Force at all there must be at least three things. In the first place, the Force must
<col>246</col>
be in being; in the second place, it must be-able to leave these shores; and, in the third place, it must have some escort to conduct it to the particular place overseas where its duties are to he carried out. Whether we have those things or not I do not know. But I absolutely decline to believe that the Territorial Army is so organised as to be able to set free the 166,000 or 167,000 men to go out and fulfil their duties overseas in the service of the Empire. Secondly, from what I have seen of the duties of the Fleet, tethered, as my noble friend said, round these shores, I do not believe, with the near approach to equality in first class ships between England and certain Continental rivals, that we can spare the number of capital ships to enable the Expeditionary Force to be efficiently escorted. So much for the Expeditionary Force.<lb/>
The next remark I wish to make is on the subject of compulsory training. 1 did not hear either the noble Earl or Lord Derby say a single word about compulsory training. We are not preaching that particular doctrine in this debate. We are dealing with the Territorial Force at the present moment. There is no reason why your Lordships should educate the country. I do not see how it arises out of the question we are now debating. Mr. Haldane has really made so many alarming remarks that if there is any question of criticism, it would be for us to say, "We criticise most emphatically the statements Mr. Haldane has made, which we do not think he can justify for a moment." If there is any education of the country to be done it should be in the way of putting the truth forward, and conducting the gentleman who has cut the pathway of unreality back into the lane of truth.<lb/>
Let me give your Lordships an example. Mr. Haldane, on June 27, 1910, made the following statement&#x2014;
<quote>"When people talk of the small Army of Great Britain I smile. The small Army of Great Britain of an expeditionary character is larger than the expeditionary armies of France and Germany put together."</quote>
The House smiles as well as Mr. Haldane. What did the right lion. gentleman, I wonder, mean by that statement? Did he mean that if we were going to invade France we could send a million men there? We all know very well that if Germany is ever going to invade France she will send, a million men into France. Does the right
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0128"/>
<col>247</col>
hon. gentleman mean that we shall have the force of this 1,000,000 men of Germany, and also the force of 1,000,000 men that would come out of France if she, on her part, were going to invade Germany? Honestly, I do not understand what a statement of that kind means. It is presumably meant to teach somebody something, but I do not think it will bring any very clear significance to your Lordships' minds, or teach your Lordships anything.<lb/>
Now let me give another example. Mr. Haldane also said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have 14 great, big, swift-moving, crushing Territorial Divisions, with their accompaniments and ancillary forces."</quote>
Just let me construe this for a moment. Why great? They are not great, because they are not up to strength. Why big? They are not big, for they are mostly composed of boys of about seventeen years of age. Why swift-moving? think Lord Derby dealt with that, and I need not go into it. As to crushing. I do not know that they are particularly crushing. Their shooting, at any rate, is not such as would be likely to enable them to destroy other forces very rapidly; and even the name dog-shooters has been abandoned now. Then as to their accompaniments. What has become a the accompaniments I do not quite know. I do not know whether this remark refers to the band or to the transport of supplies. The ancillary forces are, I presume, transport and other things&#x2014;terms which, from a military point of -view, are equally not very well known. I challenge this statement of Mr. Haldane's. These are statements made by the Minister for War, who, presumably, is educating the country as to what we require; and I really think it does not come well from the noble Lord opposite to challenge us to go and preach propaganda in the country when&#x2014;I must say it&#x2014;we have such nonsense as this talked by a person of responsibility. Mr. Haldane has frequently talked about this "great Central Defence Force." I have frequently given your Lordships the facts about that force, and I do not propose to go over them again on this occasion. But when you have deducted the Expeditionary Force and the men who must go into the garrisons and who are not mobile, you come to a very small Central Defence Force in the end. Yet we are continually being told of this great Central Defence Force which is going to crush any possible invaders.<lb/>
<col>248</col>
The next point raised by the noble Lord opposite was on the question of the relation of the defending power at home with our defence by sea. I have no doubt the noble Lord is a great authority on this matter; but may I read to your Lordships a couple of quotations on that point? The noble Lord said that all the Territorials had to do was to assume a great appearance of value, so that the Germans, or whoever intended invading us, would think twice, and then send no one over at all because they would be frightened of landing. That is what the noble Lord said. May I read to him what Mr. Asquith said on July 29, 1909, and I hope noble Lords opposite will remember this, because it does not come from this side of the House. This statement was made by Mr. Asquith after a very full investigation of the matter and after serious consideration of the question. This is what. Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"With regard to the military aspect, it is, in consequence of the finding of tie' Defence Committee, the business of the War Office</quote>
this is the important point&#x2014;
<quote>"to see that we have, under all circumstances, a properly organised and properly equipped force capable of dealing effectively with a possible invasion by 70,000 men."</quote>
My Lords, that is the point&#x2014;" capable of dealing effectively with a possible invasion by 70,000 men." It is no good, when you are talking about dealing effectively with an invasion, speaking of defence manoeuvres such as the noble Lord who has just sat down mentioned. No campaign was ever gained by simply acting on the defensive. What we have to do is to so organise our forces that they are able to crush any force that comes over here&#x2014;not merely to take the field against them, but to be able to attack and destroy that force. That is what we say the Territorial Army is unable to do.<lb/>
We say the Territorial Army is unable to do that, in the first place, because the Artillery is not, we consider, up to standard. That was very thoroughly brought out the other night. by a noble Lord who is an Artillery officer, and who spoke most clearly on this subject. He pointed out the various weaknesses that existed in the Force, and although the noble Lord opposite says that it has this wonderful power of motion and that the Force can be organised in all respects, he must have forgotten that our machine guns are of the 1890 pattern; that the whole of our
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0129"/>
<col>249</col>
mobilisation equipment supposed to be provided by the Territorial Associations is not provided by them because they have not been given the money to do it; and, in addition, there are the several other points that the noble Earl, Lord Derby, raised and the further fact that the Staff is inadequate. Therefore, my Lords, if the Force is to take the field with success, all these things require attention. It may he possible for it to take the field with success in years to come, but to-day as a swift-moving, strong Force of fourteen Territorial Divisions it only exists in the imagination of the Secretary of State for War.<lb/>
Before I sit down there is one other point. the noble Lord raised to which I desire to refer. He said that we should be certain to have a considerable amount of notice before any invading force set out from overseas, and he mentioned the fact that there would he a great collection of transports.- May I tell the noble Lord that I have personally counted the transports in the German ports on several occasions, and I can assure him that I have never known a time when the transports were not over 300,000 tons in the German ports. Whatever else may have been the result of the investigation which Lord Roberts made, it had this effect, that it knocked out a great many old figures; it knocked out the old idea that you had to have 5 tons to carry two men; and I think probably if you were to ask the military authorities to-day they would tell you that a ton per man is about what it would take the Germans to come over. Therefore if you admit that, there would only be required 70,000 tons&#x2014;or we will say 120,000 tons to give a full margin&#x2014;to bring over a force of 70,000 men. A great many times in every week there are 120,000 tons of fast-moving ships in the North Sea.<lb/>
I do not wish to take up the whole question of invasion. I do not myself regard it as nearly the most important part of this big subject. I consider that far the most important part is the question of allowing our Expeditionary Force to go abroad. Although all of us here to-day may call ourselves believers in the Blue Water School, and may laugh at the idea of the Germans invading us, suppose we had trouble in India, or in Egypt, or in any other part of the world, do you mean
<col>250</col>
to say that in the present state of things the people of England would allow this Expeditionary Force of 167,000 men to go abroad, especially as we believe that this suggested figure of 70,000 invaders is not a correct figure to-day? The figures upon which the Committee based their opinion were 1907 and. 1908 figures, and there is just as much chance to-day that the figure of 70,000 has considerably increased. As has already been pointed out, the figure went up between 1905 and 1908 from 10.000 to 70,000, and there is fully as much chance that the latter figure may now have gone up to 120,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00688"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we had a debate on this subject. the other day, and I think we then confined ourselves almost entirely to a discussion of questions of detail, and this debate was reserved for discussing the general question. The noble Earl who inaugurated this debate has asked me several questions of detail, and I will answer him. But I propose not to deal with the many other points of detail which have been raised in this debate, because, after all, one cannot deal with both things together, at least without. taking up to an inordinate amount the time of the House. I will therefore just answer, if I may, the four questions the noble Earl put to me, and then confine myself entirely to the general question.<lb/>
The noble Earl asked, first, how many men of the Territorial Force whose time expired last June have re-engaged. I find that of the men whose time expired during the last quarter, 17,591 left the Force, and 1,605 re-engaged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00689"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: Only 1,600 out of 17,000&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00690"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Those are the. figures. Then the noble Earl asked how many Regular batteries would be mobilised. if the noble Earl means by that how many Regular batteries we are going to incorporate in the organisation of the Territorial Force, I reply to him that the answer is exactly what it was at the time he was at the War Office&#x2014;none. We have never contemplated bringing into the Territorial Force units of the Regular Army. Then in regard to the practice of the Territorial Artillery, I would refer him, if I may, to the regulations of the Territorial Force with which he is no doubt familiar.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00691"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but I have referred to those and I cannot get any light from them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00692"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl will write to me on the subject I will be very glad to give him the information in regard to the question of the horses allotted to the Territorial Artillery. As I have no doubt your Lordships are aware, there is a scheme at the present moment under discussion by the Army Council and the County Associations with. regard to all horses, not only for the Regulars, but for the Special Reserve and the Territorial Force, and when that is applied every unit of the Regulars, the Special Reserve, and the Territorials will be fully horsed. I think that deals with tie noble Earl's questions. The noble Earl, Lord Derby, raised the question of the mobility of the Territorial Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00693"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: No, I did not raise it. It was the noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, who did so by stating that it was a mobile Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00694"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to quarrel over a word, but the noble Earl discussed the question of the mobility of the Territorial Force. After all, my Lords, we can discuss two separate things. One is the present state. of preparedness of the Territorial Force, and you may censure the War Office, if you think you have grounds for doing so, because of the fact that the whole of the arrangements for the Territorial Force are not complete. This is one question. The other question, which we are discussing to-day, I think, is the general question of the organisation of the Force. It is perfectly true that the Territorial Force is not entirely up to its establishment. There are certain things in which it is not yet complete. As the noble Earl know s, we are doing everything in our power to complete the supply of all those requirements. If you wish to discuss the question of the rapidity with which the Territorial Force is being brought to completion, let us by all means discuss it; but it does not come in on a question of this kind when we are discussing how far the present system is suitable for the needs of the country with regard to the resisting of invasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00695"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: We should never have brought the question forward
<col>252</col>
in any way, but Lord Ashby St. Ledgers made the statement that the Territorials were mobile in every respect. I think if such a statement had gone out to the country it would have given a very false impression of what is the case. The noble Lord, I dare say, is doing everything he can to make it mobile, but I think he will agree with nip that in neither horses, guns, wagons, nor equipment is it mobile at the present moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00696"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I have a very clear impression of what my noble friend Lord Ashby St. Ledgers said. He did indicate that he was dealing only with the general question; that is to say, with regard to the Territorial Force in its conception and in what we mean to make it&#x2014;namely, a Force organised so as to be able to take part in the field of operations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00697"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: I dare say that is what the noble Lord intends to make it, but will he say distinctly "Yes" or "No" whether it is mobile at the present moment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00698"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: It entirely depends.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00699"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: Can you move a Division at all at the present moment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00700"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: It entirely depends upon what powers we take advantage of. We have powers under the Army Act for requisitioning horses, and if we choose to put those powers into force we can supply the whole of the Territorial Divisions, and we can equally mobilise all the vehicles and everything else we want. So that the answer is "Yes"; if it is a question of having to do it in case of emergency the Territorial Force at the present moment is undoubtedly a mobile force. The noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, told us he was not going to draw a red herring across the track of this debate. But he drew something across the track which might have proved a red whale, because he opened up the general question of the organisation of the Army and discussed the general advantages of an Army Council and a Commander-in-Chief, and finally he discussed whether it was or was not advisable for us to copy the Army system of Germany in 1870. I can only say, with c regard to that, that we took over the Army organisation as we found it in those respects. Noble Lords opposite who are now impeaching the present system were
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0131"/>
<col>253</col>
the people who, after all, put the present system into force. We have found it work extremely well, and we are not in the least disposed to go back upon it; and when the noble Earl recommends us to adopt the system of Germany in 1870 I can only say that, as far as my recollection carries me, our system at the present moment is very closely allied to that of Germany. Germany was the pioneer in doing the very thing which the Esher Committee laid down, which was to define and to separate the functions which are carried out by the different officers at the head of the Army. However, that is really off the point. But when the noble Earl, Lord Derby, suggests to us that we should have, first of all, a statement with regard to the efficiency of the Territorial Force produced and signed by the Army Council, and, secondly, that we should bring in Lord Kitchener and ask him to make a report upon this question, I must say that I think the noble Earl as a member of the Government which brought in this very change, known as the reorganisation, which followed the Report of the Esher Committee, is showing some impatience&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00701"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: I only want it with regard to the Territorials.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00702"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I know; but under the scheme then suggested you provided everything required under the present system. You appointed an Inspector-General for the very purpose of doing what you are now asking should be done. To bring in people outside the Army Council, who are not what you may call the officers of the Army Council for this purpose is to upset the whole of the system, and it also &#x2014;although this is a matter. I go into with some hesitation&#x2014;might lead to very serious results affecting the general responsibility of the Secretary of State for War. I do not wish to discuss that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00703"><member>TEE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: I should like very much to get an answer to this question: Does the Inspector-General of the Forces, Sir John French, inspect Auxiliary Forces, and does he make any report on their efficiency as a whole, and, if so, is it of such a character that it can be laid before this House?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00704"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Sir John French does inspect them, and he has inspected practically the whole of the Territorial Force by this time. The result of his inspections last year was presented to Parliament.
<col>254</col>
That was a departure from the ordinary rule. I dare say the noble Earl will remember that the point was considered by the Committee, and their view, which was adopted by the Government of the day, was that it was of the utmost importance that the Inspector-General's reports should be looked upon as documents which ought not to be made public. Their view was that they were confidential documents for the. use of the Army Council, and that if they were made public the value of them might, to a certain extent, be lost.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the general question which the noble Earl raised. I have remarked before, and I certainly repeat it again, that I do think in these debates, of which we have had several in this House, we suffer from the fact that we do not get any opinion stated from what is, after all, the most important point of view&#x2014;that is, the naval point of view&#x2014;on this question. I remember the great discussion we had last, year, and in that and other discussions we had no naval opinion quoted to us with regard to this matter. As has been repeatedly laid down on this question when it has been authoritatively dealt with, invasion is first and foremost and primarily a naval question, and not a military one. We have not yet received the naval point of view with regard to it, and until we have received that point of view I think it is impossible for us to judge. After all, one can only regard this question when one considers the whole military situation and the whole naval situation at any given moment. The question of whether the Territorial Force can, or cannot, shoot at a particular moment is not the question that is going to determine the subject of invasion. The question that is going to determine the possibility of invasion is how far you use your Regular Army, your Territorial Force, and your Navy together; how far you make them work for one object; and how far you are able, if I may say so, to break them up and let them pursue different, objects.<lb/>
What are the conditions which everybody agrees are necessary to make invasion possible at all? There are three simultaneous conditions necessary to make invasion possible&#x2014;that the Regular Army is out of the country, that the Territorial Force is in the very earliest stage of its embodiment, and therefore not sufficiently hardened. up, and that the Navy has been
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0132"/>
<col>255</col>
got out of the way, or has left the coast clear. Unless all those three things occur together invasion is not a possibility. If we lose the command of the sea, if the enemy has free command of the sea and is able to pass troops into this country, then we have always considered that no measure of Conscription will save us. It is much more likely then to be a question of starvation than of fighting it out. The game is up when you get to that stage.<lb/>
The point of risk is the temporary move which allows the enemy to slip a certain number of invaders through&#x2014;I will not say losing the command of the sea. That is the point where the risk is said to lie, and if that does occur, if the enemy can temporarily or momentarily slip his transports through with an invading force on board, then it is a question of relying on the home defence of this country. That is the position we have to meet. The moment that this country would be in danger from an invasion of that kind is confined to the time when you had sent the whole of the Regular Army out of the country and the whole of the Territorial Force was still in the condition of suffering from lack of training. If the Government of the day decided to send the whole of the Regular Army abroad, all the six Divisions, and practically denude this country of Regulars before the Territorial Army had had more than a very short time of training on embodiment, then a heavy responsibility would fall upon the Navy to see that no opportunity occurred for invasion by a force of 70,000, if you accept 70,000 as the figure, although there is a great deal to be said with regard to it. But, my Lords, nobody realises that more clearly than the Navy do at the present time, and if the point one hears so often brought forward in this context is true, that to impose upon the Navy the duty of concentrating itself upon the defence of this country, or, at any rate, of preventing even the possibility of such a Force passing through, hampers them, if the Navy thought that was a thing which hampered their movements, which destroyed their power of defeating the enemy's fleets, we should have had some time or other a demand from the Navy that they should be released from that duty, and that we should institute in this country a system under winch they would never have to undertake such a duty.<lb/>
<col>256</col>
I think it is a significant fact that we have never had from the Navy any demand of that kind. The Navy have never asked us to indulge in any form of Conscription, or anything of that kind which is going to put us at the beginning of the campaign in the position in which we shall certainly be at the end of six months when the Territorial Force. has had its training on embodiment. Therefore, my Lords, in other words the Navy realise the responsibility that may be thrown upon them if we choose to send the whole of our Expeditionary Force straight away out of this country. They accept the obligation that it casts upon them, and they do so knowing that they can fulfil it without its interfering with or impairing the general strategical conception that they may have for the purpose of war. That is a point which has never been dealt with by people who have taken this into consideration. Whenever the naval question has been raised, noble Lords opposite who are critics of the present system have said we cannot have a system which is going to tether the Navy to the coasts of this country. The Navy realise that they will have to guard the coasts of this country from possible invasion; they do not protest against it; they do not try to induce the War Office to adopt. measures which will enable them to get. out of this responsibility; and they are perfectly prepared to conduct their campaign and work out their strategic operations while at the same time protecting our coasts against the danger of invasion. - That is the position with regard to this question.<lb/>
We have been asked to-day whether under all conditions the Territorial Force is capable of resisting an invasion of 70,000 men. I know that my noble friend the Leader of the House is going to explain this figure of 70,000 men, and all that it means. It has been accepted as the fixed and settled figure in regard to these things. But it is nothing of the kind. I do not think the Navy accept it at all; and whilst the Navy do not consider that anything like 70,000 men can invade this country, we, on the other hand, have made our preparations so that we can have an adequate force to enable us to deal with a larger number than that. So that you have what I may call a double overlap to make for absolute safety. My Lords, you ask
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0133"/>
<col>257</col>
whether the Force that we should have in this country on the outbreak of war would be sufficient to deal with an invasion of this kind. You have three possible alternatives. You may have the whole of the Regular Army in this country, when, of course, we could unquestionably resist a much larger invasion than that. You have the possibility of having sent out of this country four out of the six Divisions, which would leave you with two Divisions in this country. Again I say we have no doubt in our minds of being able to resist an invasion of the kind. Then you have the third alternative, which is if the whole of the Regular Army has been sent out of this country. Under those circumstances you have, as my noble friend has already pointed out, the whole of the Territorial Force; you have the whole of your Special Reserve, because, after all, at the beginning of war before the Territorial Force is hardened up you have not begun to make calls on your drafts. You have a considerable number of Reservists and young soldiers and units of the Regular Army which consist of at least one Brigade of Infantry and certain details that I have not sufficiently in my mind to be able to state to the noble Earl. But you have altogether a force of between 350,000 and 400,000 men.<lb/>
With regard to the power of that force to resist an invasion of 70,000 men, I would like to recall to your Lordships' attention the speech which Mr. Balfour made in 1905 dealing with this question, and especially that part of it in which he said that in order to calculate our greatest period of military weakness he took the very worst week during the South African war, when we had extremely few Regulars left in this country. We had a certain number of batteries of Artillery and a certain number of regiments of Infantry, most of them being divisional battalions. We had the Militia less the Militia Reserve, and we had Volunteers who had not been called up and therefore had had no training on embodiment, and out of the whole of that Force we had nothing that we could constitute in any way at all into a mobile Force. The condition of this country in those days was considerably weaker from the military point of view, both in numbers and organisation, than it could possibly be under the present system. Mr. Balfour stated in 1905 that they asked Lord Roberts on the
<col>258</col>
Committee of Imperial Defence what was the smallest army which could possibly invade this country, and he replied that 70,000 was the lowest number, and that would be a forlorn hope. That is an opinion to which we all of us bow in a matter of this kind. If Lord Roberts thought that in a condition of far greater military weakness than we can possibly be in at the present moment, weaker in every way, in numbers, organisation, equipment, and everything, 70,000 was a forlorn hope, we can say with great confidence, taking our military position at its very weakest-. at the present moment, that an invasion, of 70,000 would not succeed. That is our view of the case&#x2014;that at no period would. an invasion of 70,000 men succeed, and that we have at all times a military organisation in this country capable of withstanding a larger force than that.<lb/>
I have only to say this further. As noble Lords have pointed out, these things do change, but we have not yet got to anything like the bottom of the resources of a voluntary system. The voluntary system' is elastic. We may or may not be near the bottom of it&#x2014;I do not like to venture an opinion upon that&#x2014;but even when we have got to the end of the number of men available for home defence whom we get under the voluntary system, there is still the enormous reservoir of men that we have not begun to tap yet&#x2014;namely, the Reserve. I do not know whether any noble Lords were present the other day at that extremely interesting parade of the Surrey Veterans. No one who was present could fail to have been impressed by it, and to agree with what was said by the General, probably above all others the man most fitted to form an opinion on this particular thing&#x2014;Sir Ian Hamilton. They would have realised what an extraordinary reservoir of first-class fighting material you have in those Reservists. We consider our present numbers sufficient for the safety of this country, but should it become necessary to change them&#x2014;and I do not see why it should be&#x2014;you have a reservoir there of anything between 100,000 and 200,000 men whom you could equip, and. who would take their places in the field of operations. They would not require an organisation in the same form that the Territorial Force has, because they would be admirably equipped to go into garrisons, and you would thereby be able to set free a large number of your
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0134"/>
<col>259</col>
mobile troops who at present fill the garrisons. If it became necessary to do so, you could enormously strengthen the whole of your Home Defence Force, and you could strengthen it with what is undoubtedly first-class material. Therefore, my Lords, we are perfectly convinced of this, that not only is our present system the right one, but that under it we have got sufficient forces, and forces of the right kind, to make this country perfectly safe against invasion. The advantage we have is that the system is not by any means a hard-and-fast one, but one that is elastic and capable of expansion. Therefore I reply to the noble Earl, with great confidence, that the measures we have taken for securing this country against possible invasion are sufficient and satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00705"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene at this stage merely in deference to the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down. I fully re-echo what fell from my noble friend Lord Derby when he congratulated the House on the entry of a new element into the debate in the person of the noble Lord opposite, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, and I am sure the speech he made has added to the interest of this discussion. But I cannot help feeling that this debate should not be entirely restricted to the Front Benches. We have noble Lords in the House of great authority on this subject. For instance, I see in his place the noble Viscount Lord Esher. There is no man in this House who has had more to do with the organisation of the Territorial Force than Lord Esher. He has the great authority also of being a member of the Defence Committee. He was Chairman of the Committee that was so well known as the Duma, which originally brought together a large number of those who have since been instrumental in working the Territorial Force, and I cannot help wishing, in these very intricate matters on which there is so divergent an opinion expressed between the two sides of the House, that we sometimes might have the advantage of the counsel of the noble Viscount, who speaks from an absolutely independent position, and who, in such a debate as that which was raised by the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, the other day, would certainly have been able to tell us the state of the Territorial Force in Ldonon with an authority to which none of us on this side of the House can pretend.<lb/>
<col>260</col>
I say that the more from a feeling that it is most desirable, if we possibly can, to come to common ground, because I regret as much as anybody the controversy which has arisen as to the relative strength of the forces now and a few years ago. I am not going into that question again this evening, though if at any time the noble Lord opposite is willing to clear up the question with me in such a manner that we may arrive at an authoritative statement, I can only tell him that the figures which cause me to differ so very much from his conclusions are entirely at his disposal. The sole object which I have in this matter is not to prove the superiority of one scheme over another scheme, or of one system over another system, but I am absolutely convinced that in the desire which the present Secretary of State has shown during his period at the War Office to advance to the very best of his ability the Volunteer or Territorial Force, he has fallen into the pitfall which lay before every Secretary of State, and which every Secretary of State successively has had to try to avoid&#x2014; namely, of doing all for the Force which is the most popular with those who have to vote the money, but which does involve, and has involved as I maintain in this case, a serious reduction and weakening of the Regular Forces, on which, when emergency comes, you will always have to depend at the first stroke. I do not labour that point.. I have made it before, but I am absolutely convinced that when the history of this Administration comes to be written., the fact that the experienced troops, especially the Artillery, have been reduced, and that in a moment of emergency you will not be able to make them up, will stand out more strikingly even than the advance of the Territorial Forces.<lb/>
I cannot help feeling at this moment, even after the very direct speeches which have been made, that we have still not wholly succeeded in conveying to the minds of the spokesmen of the Government what it is that we desire. I was quite unaware that Lord Portsmouth intended to place on record his opinion of the inadequacy of the Territorial Force. I followed every word of the speech of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary, and I fully realise that he endeavoured to assure us by quotations which do not seem to me in all respects to carry the effect which he desires to make. The noble
 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0135"/>
<col>261</col>
Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, adjured us not to admonish the Government, but to try to convince the country, and he told us that it was first of all a question of the Navy, and not of the Army. But the whole point of the speeches of the noble Earl, of my noble friend beside me, and of Lord Lovat, seems to have been missed by the Under-Secretary. The point of their speeches was that after a review of the whole naval and military position, the Prime Minister came down and told the House of Commons, speaking as President of the Defence Committee, that a degree of danger existed which a previous Prime Minister declared in his opinion did not exist, and that what the War Office had to do was to provide against an attack by 70,000 men, which was not the figure, or anything like the figure, adopted three years ago. I think it is a mistake that we should&#x2014;it is almost impossible to avoid arguing these matters on figures&#x2014;tie ourselves too closely to these figures. They must be mutable. They are subject to all sorts of considerations. But when they are given to us on such very high authority, we as an Opposition have a right to ask simply the fair question, "Can you make good your resistance to that body of men?" I throw all the rest aside. I do regret, as I said before, that there is a tendency to exaggeration OD the Front Bench opposite in this respect. I am quite certain that when Lord Ashby St. Ledgers rises to-morrow morning, he will regret that in the fluency of his speech he told us that the Territorial Force was a complete military engine.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00709"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I made a note of the words that fell from the noble Lord. He represented the Territorial Force as a mobile Force, and said that all the accessories were ready. As representing

the Territorial Force, I know that is very far from being the fact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00710"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, here are we in the High Court of Parliament having these things said from the Government Bench; and they are taken up and believed in and made the subject of universal laudation and cheers at Liberal meetings. It is said, "Look what has been put before us. We have a complete military engine with all its accessories." The noble Lord now says he only means that the organisation is complete; that there is something which there was not before (and I pay a tribute to it, as I have done before) which enables it to be better used. Only yesterday I received a letter from one of the supporters of the Secretary of State in the county of Haddington asking, "Why is it that Lord Roberts and Lord Lovat are always attacking what the Secretary of State tells us is the fact, and endeavouring to show that it is not so?" That is why we have from time to time, and as I think too frequently, to bring forward these points; and I confess that I still want to know why the Government cannot give us some military authority on this subject.<lb/>
I do not ask for a single thing which I have not myself been asked for over and over again as Secretary of State for War, and asked by the noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, whom I am glad to say I would far sooner meet when he is shooting at me from in front than when he used to fire at me from behind. I was asked over and over again in old days, "Have you the authority of the Commander-in-Chief for what you have been saying?" And I have been asked, "Has the Adjutant-General, Sir Redvers Buller, agreed with that statement?" In the days of the South African war, and even before the war, we were never allowed to make these statements in the House of Commons on civil authority if we could not support them by military authority.<lb/>
We have had a very serious statement from Lord Portsmouth this evening. He sat on the Army Council for two or three years, and lie has told us that you could not get a military opinion, because the Army Council were the creatures of the Secretary of State. I was sorry for that expression; and if it is a justifiable one, then all possible belief in what comes to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0136"/>
<col>263</col>
us on the authority of the Army Council must go; and it must be put down solely to the authority of the Secretary of State. The noble Earl told us that the Secretary of State keeps from the Army Council any subject that he does not choose to submit to it. My Lords, that is a most remarkable revelation. It is absolutely novel. It was absolutely unknown in the days when the Army Council did not exist in the present sense as a statutory body like the Admiralty. And this increases our desire to know whether these distinguished military men do believe that the Territorial Army, or what is left after the Expeditionary Force has gone abroad, is a sufficient and efficient force to deal with an invasion of 70,000 men.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Under-Secretary told us several times that it is for the Government of the day to decide whether the Expeditionary Force is to go out of the country at all, and in what numbers. That may be; but there are contingencies in which the hands of the Government will be forced, and they will need every soldier they can muster from the whole of the six Divisions. A bolt from the blue, as was pointed out in this debate was the case in the war of France and Germany, may occur at any time, which might plunge us into war; and I do assure your Lordships that you must consider, if you are going to send a military force abroad, what is left behind. I know there are a large number of troops. The Duke of Bedford the other night explained how those would be made up; that some battalions a thousand strong would have very few efficient men, and not half their officers. That sort of thing is no use. That is not going to frighten an enemy from invading us. It comes down to this question, Can the Territorial Force as at present organised, with the degree of efficiency which you can hope from it and with the numbers you believe it is going to rise to (although I am afraid we have got pretty near the bottom of voluntary recruiting), and with the Artillery it has got, deal with the forces it is suggested it could deal with?<lb/>
Only one other word on this subject. As the Regular Army was organised by the late Government our intention was, and the numbers show it, that there should be one-third of the Force available to be mobilised at home to resist an invasion of 120,000 men. You have not got that now; and it lies upon you, I venture to
<col>264</col>
say, to show us, on military authority, that you can still face the possibility you have to meet. Names have been brought before your Lordships to-night&#x2014;the name of Lord Kitchener and others. I do not wish to press for any name. I cannot help remembering a famous speech of the present Secretary of State in the year 1902, in which he said that he despaired of the War Office, and that the only thing which could possibly make it right was to turn Lord Kitchener loose in it. I confess that in the debates we have had during the last few weeks it has occurred to me once or twice that that opportunity has come to the Secretary of State, and that instead of immuring Lord Kitchener in a fortress, the better way would be to turn him loose in the War Office. What we want is to know, on military authority, whether what the Prime Minister has told us of the possible emergency we may have to face is accepted. We want to know whether the noble Lord can tell us that high military authorities concur with the speeches which have been made over and over again by the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary, and can assure us that if that number of men were landed to-morrow and our Expeditionary Force had left the country, we should be able to meet them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00711"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ESHER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Viscount Midleton has made an appeal to me to intervene in this debate. I wish in a few sentences to explain to your Lordships why, in my opinion, it is quite impossible for me to intervene effectively. The questions which your Lordships have been discussing are mainly questions which have been discussed in the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which I am a member, and are likely to be discussed again. I am quite sure that my noble friend Viscount Midleton, if he was sitting upon the Front Bench as a Minister, would be the first to admit that it is not within my province to discuss in this House any question which is a matter for consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence. The proper spokesman of that Committee in this House must be one of the Ministers of the Crown; and I do not think that it is possible for me, under these circumstances, to refer to the main subject which has been discussed by your Lordships this evening.<lb/>
But with regard to the London Territorial Force my responsibility is somewhat different, and I do not say that upon that
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0137"/>
<col>265</col>
question I cannot speak with complete frankness to your Lordships. The London County Association, like the other County Associations in this country, were made responsible for the raising of a definite number of men. I believe that the efforts of the London County Association have been as successful as those of any Association in this country, and that on the whole the work of that Association has been as well done as the work of any other Association. The net result is known, I believe, to all members of this House who take an interest in these questions. We have not succeeded in raising the full number of men allocated to the county of London. We have raised something like eighty-six or eighty-seven per cent., but we have not been able to raise the full number. It is also a somewhat distressing fact that in the last few months, which is the best recruiting season, we have not only failed to increase our numbers, but our numbers have somewhat diminished. Of course it is a matter of personal opinion, and it can be contradicted by my noble friend Lord Lucas; but in my opinion we have raised the maximum number of men which we shall be able to raise in London. I do not believe that time is likely to increase the number of Territorial troops who can be raised in this country, and that is a very pertinent fact to which His Majesty's Government and this House ought to give the gravest consideration.<lb/>
If I am right, and if we have raised the full number of men we are likely to raise in the county of London, the same reasons which in my view will prevent us from increasing that number possibly apply to other County Associations. I think, therefore, that it is as well for His Majesty's Government to face the fact that the total number of Territorial troops now raised in this country, which amounts to something like 275,000 men and which corresponds remarkably with the numbers of the Volunteers before the great change was made, is likely to be the maximum number which can be raised under the existing conditions and under a voluntary system. It is important, and indeed almost essential, that in considering all these questions of defence, His Majesty's Government and the country should understand that main fact. My Lords, beyond that I do not think it would be desirable for me to add anything to the debate which has taken place this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<col>266</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00712"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RAGLAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this late hour I do not propose to detain your Lordships more than a moment or two. I wish to express my great interest in what has fallen from the noble Viscount on the Cross Benches. I have had the same feeling myself, that we have got to the utmost number that the voluntary system will produce unless we reduce the training so as to make it an absolute farce. I was therefore very glad to hear the noble Viscount make those remarks, which I consider the most important that have been made during the course of this debate. I wish to allude to one or two things that were said by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War. If I may be allowed to say so, they seemed to me to be very remarkable statements. First with regard to the Army Council, the noble Lord said that the system of the Council was working with perfect satisfaction to everybody. I can assure the noble Lord that if he were to collect the officers of the Army outside the War Office who are in favour of the present conditions he could put them in an exceedingly small room. I very much doubt whether outside the War Office itself there are many people in the country who have much confidence in the Army Council, and I am convinced that such a system as exists would not last forty-eight hours in a time of actual war and that you would have to revert with speed and confusion to the former system which obtained before the Commander-in Chief was abolished.<lb/>
The Under-Secretary of State for War complained that we did not on these Benches when raising these questions make sufficient of the naval question. Not many of us, I am afraid, are naval experts, but we must, of course, all recognise that the defence of this country depends on the forces of the Crown as a whole, whether those forces are trained to fight on shore or on sea. The defence of the Empire as a whole must rest on three branches&#x2014;the naval branch, the force that fights on the sea; the force that fights at home; and the force that fights abroad; and what many of us feel is that with regard to the Expeditionary Force and the force for home defence the Government are on the horns of a great dilemma, because they cannot send the Expeditionary Force abroad until they have trained the home force sufficiently to defend these shores, and they will not be able to embody
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0138"/>
<col>267</col>
and sufficiently train the force for home defence as long as the Expeditionary Force remains at home. That seems to me the dilemma you will always be faced with. We were very badly placed in the course of the South African war by the refusal of the Volunteer Force to do any permanent duty. The result of this would be the unfortunate tying of the Navy to the shores of this country, which we would all most deeply deplore, and I am sure nobody more than the naval officers themselves. The Navy require a free hand to enable them to carry out properly their strategic work of making the shores of the enemy the frontiers of this country, and therefore the nation must be satisfied that they have a sufficient defensive force inside these islands. Let us look at what has been done by the Secretary of State for War for the actual protection of the shores of this country. He has abolished, first of all, the Militia, and established the Special Reserve, which consists of about half the number of men that the Militia consisted of&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00720"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RAGLAN </member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will find of necessity after a war that a force of that sort must dwindle to a certain extent. The men have had a long embodiment which they did not expect, and it takes a certain time to get over this. As a matter of fact, you have now got about 60,000 men in the Special Reserve, most of them old Militiamen, and nearly the whole of those who are not Militiamen are men who have failed to pass the medical examination for the Regular Army. Then you have swept away the defence of your ports, the submarine miners together with the whole
<col>268</col>
of the garrisons of the forts and the Militia Artillery, and you have no force raised to fill their places. The noble Lord says, "we are all right; we have got the veterans." I must say that of all the curious remarks that have been made, the one about the veterans was the most curious, because the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War has assisted to drive out of the Special Reserve all the veterans that existed. Anybody over thirty is too antique to serve in the Special Reserve; and I cannot understand if a man is not fit to serve in the Special Reserve why he should be fit to serve in some other force which does not exist. The noble Lord says the Special Reserve are better trained than the old Militia. All I can say is, the Special Reserve does not have anything like the collective training that the old Militia had. It has had twenty-five per cent. of its collective training knocked off, and it is infinitely worse off in officers and must be worse off also in non-commissioned officers. The twenty-five per cent. less collective training will affect the non-commissioned officers much more than the others. The net result, after the juggle of figures has been gone through, is that the Regular Army has been largely reduced and the Militia abolished.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00721"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>:My Lords, I feel disposed to apologise for intervening at this late hour of the debate, particularly as it has so often fallen to me to close debates on this subject; but several points have been raised that make it imperative for me to say one or two words. We must all recognise the marked ability with which the noble Earl opposite, Lord Portsmouth, introduced this question, and perhaps he will allow me to say that I do not think the case which he desired to put forward could have been more forcibly put. 1 also recognise the ever-increasing interest which the noble Earl takes in these military questions since he ceased to be directly responsible for them in this House. But I confess that the noble Earl, since he crossed the floor, has adopted some formidable opinions; he has joined the school of blood and iron; and he holds up for our admiration, and possibly also for our imitation, the process which went on in Prussia during the sixties in the formation
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0139"/>
<col>269</col>
of I suppose, the most formidable engine of war which has ever been created&#x2014;the German Army. I was sorry, however, that the noble Earl thought it necessary to speak in quite such forcible terms of the Army Council. It is quite legitimate for any man who holds those views to deplore the change that was made by the abolition of the office of Commander-in Chief. That, I think, is an arguable matter. But surely it is possible to hold those views without saying, what I feel certain is not the case but which the noble Earl seemed to imply, that the Army Council, as at present constituted, consists of people who either do not possess or do not dare to express any opinion in opposition to that of the Secretary of State for War. I have no knowledge, naturally, of the inner workings of the Army Council, but I cannot believe that that is the case. I also cannot help remembering that in the days when there was a Commander-in-Chief, as the noble Marquess opposite knows very well, there were occasions from time to time when difficulties arose between that officer and the Government of the day.<lb/>
The point to which I particularly wish to allude, and which is the real reason for my rising, is this question of the 70,000 invaders, which has loomed so large in the course of the present debate. The noble Earl opposite, Lord Derby, implied, in fact stated, that in 1905 when Mr. Balfour made his famous statement in another place, it was assumed that the only attack which could be made upon this country was by a force of 10,000 men, and that now that number had risen to 70,000. The noble Earl went on to say that the Territorial Force having been fixed as an establishment of 315,000 on the basis of an invading force of 10,000, it ought now, on that showing, to be considerably larger. Well, clearly it ought; because in that case it ought to number no less than 2,205,000 men. Therefore I think the noble Earl will see that there was not a very definite foundation for that statement of his.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00722"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the noble Earl? I put it on the statement of the noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, who said that the Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill was framed on the basis that the Force would have to resist a raid of 10,000 men.</membercontribution></p>
<col>270</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00723"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am no authority on military subjects, but I think it will be generally agreed that if the possible force which could land in this country were finally and definitely limited to 10,000 men, an establishment of 315,000 of even only half-trained men would be considered somewhat excessive. As to this number of 70,000, my noble friend behind me stated the genesis of that figure. It was first mentioned by Mr. Balfour in another place, on the authority of Lord Roberts, as the smallest force with which an enemy would invade this country with a view of conquering it&#x2014;that is to say, with a view of taking London&#x2014;and Lord Roberts regarded such an attack as in the nature of a forlorn hope. Therefore if that is taken as the lowest invasion figure, every figure below that must have been taken to constitute a raid&#x2014;that is to say, an attack not made with the hope of conquering the country, but merely with a view of causing alarm, and, if possible, of course, of escaping after the injury was done. Therefore when the noble Earl, Lord Derby, said in the course of the debate on July 11, if I may quote his words&#x2014;
<quote>"A few years ago the Blue Water School prevailed to such an extent that it was questionable whether a dinghy's crew could be landed on our shores. That gradually went up to 10,000, and it has now gone up to 70,000 men, which 1 believe is the recognised figure at which a raid eau be put at the present moment,"</quote>
if the noble Earl will excuse my saying so, that is not really the case. This figure of 70,000 was used, on Lord Roberts's authority, as the lowest figure at which an invasion could possibly be taken. It was taken over, so to speak, for the purposes of argument by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in the same debate, and it has so far held the field ever since. But, as my noble friend behind me desired to point out, it must not be taken as the opinion of the Defence Committee, on the authority of the statement made by the Prime Minister on July 29 of last year, that they suppose for a moment that a force of 70,000 men can be landed at any time on these shores. The figure of 70,000 was, I think, used once more in this connection, because the result of the inquiry of which the noble Lord, Lord Lovat, has spoken undoubtedly showed a certain alteration in the conditions. It showed a greater power of massing tonnage in certain foreign ports, and it also showed a marked increase in
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0140"/>
<col>271</col>
the capacity of ships by which a raiding or invading force could be brought over. It was therefore necessary to increase to a considerable extent the raiding figure, if I may put it so, of 10,000 men. It was considerably increased, and it was assumed for the purposes of arriving at full security that two or three even of such raiding forces might be successfully landed on our shores, thus bringing the number up, not to 70,000 men, but within measurable distance of it; and the figure of 70,000, so far as I know, was only used to represent a margin over the figure of a possibility of two or even three combined raids evading the Fleet. It certainly was never the intention of my right hon. friend the Prime Minister, and I think anybody who reads the speech and reads that observation with its context and does not rely on it as quoted, will see that it is not fair to put the construction upon it that it is supposed that a single force all coming together of 70,000 men would, in the opinion of the Defence Committee, have a reasonable chance of evading the Fleet. I was anxious to make this clear, because I can see from what has been said in almost every speech that a wrong construction has been put upon the speech, and it has been assumed as something of a probability that 70,000 men could practically at any moment be dumped down at some point or other on the shores of these islands.<lb/>
I might also mention, as another caution, that for the purposes of argument it seems to be assumed, supposing a war were to be declared on Monday, that the whole of our Expeditionary Force, the whole of the six Divisions, would start on Tuesday, and that we might be invaded on Wednesday morning. My Lords, things do not happen in that manner. In the first place&#x2014;and, of course, I say this with the caution with which it is necessary to speak of all political contingencies&#x2014;I confess I cannot foresee a state of things which would make it imperative, as seems to be assumed by noble Lords, to send the whole six Divisions out of the country at once at the beginning of a war. I cannot conceive any political combination, particularly in the case of our being at war without any ally, which would cause us to desire to send the whole of the six Divisions out of the country at one moment; and therefore, so far, the argument that you may have denuded the country of Regular troops without having
<col>272</col>
 subjected your Territorial Force to a period of training, seems to me not so strong as I quite admit on paper it appears to be. As a matter of practical politics, I confess it does not seem to me that that is a contingency which is likely to occur, although, of course, noble Lords reviewing the whole political field may reach a different opinion. I think it is quite clear&#x2014;and I make a present of this statement to noble Lords opposite&#x2014;that if the danger were supposed to be imminent not more than four of the Divisions would be allowed to leave the country until the Territorial Force had received what is regarded as an adequate training. I must say again that it appears to me noble Lords opposite prove too much. The noble and gallant Field Marshal is not in his place, but he doubles the invading number and puts it at 150,000 men. If that number could be landed on these shores then I confess it seems to me that the only course you could take is to do what Continental nations have to do&#x2014;that is to say, guard your frontier with Regular troops; you would require a couple of Army Corps, or whatever it may be, mobilised on your frontier because your sea frontier had, in effect, become a land frontier. My Lords, that is a contingency which, if we had to face it, we should no doubt face whatever the cost; but it is not the belief of the military authorities, speaking generally, that such a contingency is likely. We agree that if a large invading force can be landed in this country, the Territorial Force, after having undergone a period of training, might not conceivably be adequate at any rate for that complete victory which you would desire; but that, of course, remains the point of difference, not I think so much between us and noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite, as between us and some other noble Lords in the House.<lb/>
I may be excused if I do not follow the noble Lord who spoke last into the detailed criticism which he made on the present condition of the Special Reserve and of the Territorial Army. I do not think that my noble friend behind me, the Under-Secretary of State for War, was disposed, as far as I could gather, to accept all those allegations of the noble Lord as being thoroughly accurate. There is one other point with which I wish to deal, that is the demand which has been made by several noble Lords, including the noble Viscount opposite, Lord Midleton, for the testimony
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0141"/>
<col>273</col>
of a military authority with regard to the present condition of the Territorial Force. I confess I cannot think that that is a reasonable demand. The Territorial Force has only been in existence for two years, and although by common admission there are gaps to be filled&#x2014;and I do not deny that some of the gaps may be important&#x2014;by the testimony of military authorities outside the War Office I may mention that continual progress is being made towards a condition of efficiency. I entirely deprecate the practice of asking in either House of Parliament for the individual opinions of soldiers at the War Office. The noble Viscount. said that he was continually subjected to requisitions of that kind when he was at. the War Office. Well, as that happened some time ago I have no hesitation in saying that I think the demands made on him were thoroughly improper so far as they related to this particular subject. I do not think it is reasonable or right that individual opinions, either of soldiers at the War Office or of sailors at the Admiralty, should be demanded in support of the policy of the Government of the day. I think it is assumed that as long as they stay at the offices they give their advice, and that, in my opinion, is as far as anybody outside is entitled to go.<lb/>
I have only one more observation to make, and that is with regard to the interesting remarks of my noble friend on the Cross Benches, Lord Esher. He seemed to believe, at any rate as regards London, and also, probably, as regards other parts of England, that the expansion of the Territorial Force had reached its limit. I always pay the highest attention, and so I am sure do we all, to the opinion of my noble friend. But it strikes me, looking at the matter from outside, that when he save this he says it speaking of the existing conditions exactly as they are; and if it should be found necessary or desirable at any time to further expand the Territorial Force, I have very little doubt that if you are prepared to spend more money on it the thing could be done. What I have no doubt produces the limitation of the Territorial Force at this moment is the fact that the Secretary of State for War, like other people, has to work with a limited sum of money; and if it should be found that the Force does not expand to the full establishment, or to a larger number still should the country require
<col>274</col>
that, the country will have to consider whether it is prepared to pay more for a different article. That is a matter upon which the country always has to make up its mind, and when the time comes I have no doubt. it will do so. I have nothing more to add. I certainly do not deprecate these debates, because on points such as the one with regard to the 70,000 invading force, as to which your Lordships opposite seem to have drawn an erroneous deduction from what was said by my right hon. friend in another place, we are glad to have the opportunity of correcting any misconceptions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00724"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the following statement of Mr. Haldane on Tuesday, 8th March, in reference to an inquiry by Sir Samuel Scott as to the strength and composition of the Central Home Defence Force: "Is it supposed that all the troops in the garrisons would sit still? I should think they would flock to re-inforce the Central Force"; and to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War what is the exact meaning of Mr. Haldane's statement.<lb/>
We understand that these troops are not mobile, so that I suppose the term "flock" is a very excellent method of describing them. As well as the difficulty of actually getting from place to place there seems to be this further difficulty, that should they leave the garrisons of these places unprotected there might be a considerable danger to Naval Arsenals and to the country. The presumption is that if a garrison is put in a place it is meant to he held.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00725"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would like to answer the noble Lord's Question by asking him another. Is it really worth his while to take up the time of the House in putting down Questions of this kind, because, even if there was no rule of secrecy, which he knows very well I have to observe with regard to our mobilisation arrangements, it would, from the very nature of the question, be absolutely impossible for me to say what would or would not be done in the event of a hostile force landing on these shores. The measures that would be taken to meet that force would have to depend entirely on the nature of the circumstances under which the invasion was made. We may be perfectly certain
 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0142"/>
<col>275</col>
of two things&#x2014;that whoever was responsible or in supreme command would make every possible effort to do everything that was necessary to be done to thoroughly defeat that force as rapidly as possible; and that if it was necessary to draw troops from outlying stations, or anything of that sort, the thing would be done. But to try and lay down beforehand a policy with regard to that is, of course, quite out of the question and quite absurd. The thing is bound to be met at the time. With regard to the noble Lord's Question as to how far these troops will be able to move if they are required, I would remind him of his own previous speeches, in which he proved to his own satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of a considerable number of noble Lords on his side of the House, that most of the Territorial Army was going to be employed in garrisons. Well, if that is so we should have a considerable number of mobile troops released, so that there will be no difficulty in moving them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00726"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Lord in his answer asks me a question I presume I have a right to reply. If the noble Lord will admit that a large proportion of the Territorial Army will be required for garrisons, I have certainly got an admission that I have never been able to get before, and I am quite prepared to take that as an advance. I have always argued, and I think definitely proved, that you have not got enough men in this country to fill the garrison towns and naval bases, and we have always said that you would have to draw very largely from the Territorial Army, and instead of the Defence Force consisting of the 300,000 that you claim it would probably only consist of 200,000. If the noble Lord puts that as his answer I am quite prepared to take it. But in that case you must then reduce the number of the Central Defence Force to something like 200,000, which we always say on this side of the House it actually is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00727"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: If I may have the leave of the House to reply shortly, I would say that I always feel when the noble Lord is speaking that the legal Bar has lost a very able advocate, because no one has more power than the noble Lord in the way of trying to make people make an admission which they have no desire to make. I can only say that I admit nothing in the reply I made to the noble Lord, and he can draw what inference he likes from what I said.</membercontribution></p>
<col>276</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00728"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Then we must draw one of two conclusions&#x2014;either that the Territorial Force will go into garrisons, or that Mr. Haldane is what is vulgarly called "talking through his hat."</membercontribution></p>

<title>VATERSAY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00729"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary for Scotland&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. In view of the fact that Vatersay Farm paid a rent of &#x00A3;350, and was purchased on that basis, whereas now let in 58 crofts it only pays a rental of &#x00A3;180, how does the Secretary for Scotland account for the diminution in the productive power of the Island as shown by the diminished rental?</li>
<li>2. How many of the 58 crofters to whom crofts have been allotted have houses and permanently reside in Vatersay?</li>
<li>3. With regard to the proceedings against certain squatters for removal stated to have been decided in the Board's favour (page vii)&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(i)Were any steps taken to enforce the decision of the Court; and</li>
<li>(ii)Are all such squatters, or any of them, in occupation of crofts under the Board?</li></ol></li>
<li>4. Are any of the 58 crofters, and, if so, how many, persons who left their crofts in Mingulay Island? If so, what steps were taken by the Board to satisfy themselves, according to their Circular (Appendix VII., page 6), that these men were possessed of cash and stock sufficient to enable them profitably to occupy a holding?</li>
<li>5. Whether it is a fact that the school on Mingulay Island, the building of which cost the ratepayers over &#x00A3;700, has been closed owing to the exodus of the population?</li>
<li>6. Whether it is a fact that in order to accommodate the crofters in Vatersay the erection of a school has been sanctioned at a cost to the ratepayers of about &#x00A3;1,200?</li>
</ol>
It will be in your Lordships' recollection that Vatersay Farm paid at one time a rent in one sum of &#x00A3;350 per annum. The tenant was well satisfied, and was paying his way. The farm was then
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0143"/>
<col>277</col>
bought by the Secretary for Scotland last year for a sum of &#x00A3;6,250, and it is now divided amongst fifty-eight crofters at a total rental of &#x00A3;180. I do not know whether the Secretary for Scotland is intending to carry out this as a paying business transaction or as an entirely philanthropic one, but, if it is a business transaction, on the face of it I am sure your Lord-shins will agree with me it is utterly bad estate management. If, on the contrary, it is a philanthropic object, it fails entirely or to a very great extent in its intention, because with a rent reduced from &#x00A3;350 to &#x00A3;180 the rates which were levied upon that must fall upon other people, and be a great burden to them. I do not wish to go further into that question. As far as the second Question is concerned, it is a perfectly plain one and can be easily answered. With regard to the third Question, I would call your Lordships' attention to the Report, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"The proceedings we had to take against certain squatters for removal were decided in our favour both by the sheriff's substitute, and, on appeal, by the sheriff."</quote>
And further on it says&#x2014;
<quote>"Payment of loans and rents. We thought it our duty to intimate that if there was an immediate improvement in this respect steps would not be taken to enforce payment or to foreclose."</quote>
I should like to ask the Secretary for Scotland if he would be good enough to answer the first three Questions before I allude to the fourth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00730"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I suggest, with great respect to the House of which I am a very new member, that it is not a convenient process to put down a series of Questions of this kind, and then invite a sort of running debate upon them. I shall be glad at all times to give the noble Lord and any other noble Lord all the information that is at my disposal on any questions of administration upon which the Government no longer wishes to reserve any discretion; but I do suggest that it might be better if the noble Lord would allow me on a future occasion of this kind to give him by letter, or otherwise, the information which he desires, and then, if there was still any point on which he wished to raise a discussion on details involving a long series of questions and figures, I should be very glad to place myself at his disposal.<lb/>
<col>278</col>
I will now give him such information as I have on the points he has mentioned. May I say, as a preliminary, that this question was discussed fully in your. Lordships' House last year, and I was then able to give a good deal of information upon it. Your Lordships will not expect me at this hour of the night to go into any very controversial matter. I will only say this, that the purchase of Vatersay by the Government was not undertaken as a voluntary undertaking initiated by them. The noble Lord will remember the circumstances, and I need not go into them. It was never meant to be a business undertaking. In regard to the other alternative which the noble Lord has put, it has certainly benefited those who are there, but it is altogether too early to judge of it as having afforded permanent relief or permanent benefit to them or to others. I will also make this one further observation, that, as the noble Lord himself knows, the relief of congestion and the purchase of property of this kind has many indirect effect s which can hardly be measured without a more detailed discussion of the matter titan I am able to give.<lb/>
The answer to the noble Lord's first Question is that. the farm does not at present command so high a price for its present uses as it did for its former uses. To the second Question the answer is that the later information which I have is to the effect that about thirty-five of the new tenants have taken up residence on Vatersay. The Board understand that the remainder will do so without undue delay. With regard to the third Question, the noble Lord will, I hope, allow me to say, with reference to the first heading, that it is not advisable to discuss matters of administration which are not yet determined, but I may inform him that the Board have not yet proceeded to evict by force. Under the second head, I am able to say that one is in the occupation of a crofter. It fell vacant and was allotted to him. The noble Lord does not wish me to go any further, I understand, at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00731"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: With regard to Mingulay Island, this is the first time we have heard about it, but it is an island about six miles south of Vatersay, and I understand that a considerable number of persons have left the Island of Mingulay and gone to the Island of Vatersay. If
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0144"/>
<col>279</col>
 your Lordships will turn to Appendix VII., page 6. to the notice inviting applications for holdings on Vatersay, you will see that one of the regulations is that applications for the proposed holdings are invited from landless crofters and squatters; and in the next Appendix applicants for holdings in Vatersay are asked their occupation, and. further down, what capital they have at their command (<i>a</i>) in cash, (<i>b</i>) in stock, (<i>c</i>) fishing boats, etc.; and further down still they have to show what their ability is to manage a. holding. I should like to ask the Secretary for Scotland what steps he has taken to possess himself of this information, and, if possible, what information he has on the subject, because I have a statement here of rent in arrears in Mingulay Island and Barra, which shows that twenty men have left the Island of Mingulay and gone to the Island of Vatersay. They were all tenants of the owner, Lady Gordon Cathcart, and were nearly all of them some ten to fifteen years in arrears of rent to her. The total amount of rents was &#x00A3;51 8<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for the year's rent to Martinmas, 1909, and the arrears due on December 31, 1909, amount altogether to &#x00A3;612 19<i>s</i>. This is really a very important question, and I hope that the noble Lord will not try to put us off in the way in which he has done I think a little bit in regard to the former Questions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00732"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: In reply to the last remark of the noble Lord, if he will kindly make his observation a little more definite I shall be glad to do my best to give him any information which he seeks. In reply to the Question he has now asked, two of the selected applicants are crofters in Mingulay; others, I understand, are cotters and fishermen there. They complied with the Form in Appendix VII. with regard to particulars, and the steps taken by the Board are described on pages 6 and 7 of the Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00733"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: According to the return which Lord Saltoun produces, either fourteen or sixteen of these crofters who were in great arrears with their rent have simply left Mingulay and gone to Vatersay where they have been accepted as responsible tenants. This is a statement from the estate which the noble Lord can see if he likes, and this is the sort of arrears they are in: Mary Campbell, one year's rent &#x00A3;2, arrears &#x00A3;26;
<col>280</col>
John Gillies, rent &#x00A3;3 5<i>s</i>., arrears &#x00A3;47; and so on all the way down; and it comes out that the total rent was &#x00A3;51 a year and the arrears &#x00A3;612. There are about sixteen of them now at Vatersay, and they are accepted as responsible tenants. I think it is a very important question. If the Congested Districts Board say they have satisfied themselves beforehand that the persons whom they take as crofters are responsible tenants, I do not know what means they have taken of ascertaining what the antecedents of these people were, but it certainly does appear to require more explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00734"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: So far as I am aware, this is the first time that the information which the noble Lord has been good enough to give has been made public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00735"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: This is a return of the estate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00736"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether the return of that estate is made public as a rule. I can only say that this is the first time that the information which the noble Lord has kindly furnished to your Lordships has reached me. The proceedings of the Congested Districts Board in seeking and selecting tenants are described in their Report. They point out that applicants were invited for fifty-eight holdings, and that eighty or ninety applications were received; and they selected from these eighty or ninety applicants those whom they considered best fitted to take up the holdings which they offered. As I am informed, out of sixteen or eighteen individuals whom the noble Lords have mentioned two were crofters on Mingulay. I do not know what was the position of the others, but I am informed that two were crofters and the others cotters or fishermen. What steps have been taken in the past to collect rents at Mingulay I am not aware of. The Government were not responsible for the administration or the collection of rent in that island. But I do know this, that Mingulay is a rocky island on the northwest coast of Scotland bound by stormy seas. It is quite impossible for a boat to land there if there are not a certain number of young and active men on the island, and I have no doubt what has happened has been this, that the young men having seen an opportunity or having sought an opportunity of leaving the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0145"/>
<col>281</col>
island have done so, and that has really led to an exodus of the population from this small island. That is, I believe, what has happened. I will now answer the further Questions if the noble Lord so wishes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00737"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Might I, by permission of the House, say before the noble Lord leaves that matter that what, he has said is no answer whatever to the Question addressed to him&#x2014;namely, what steps did the Congested Districts Board take to satisfy themselves that these were responsible tenants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00738"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The members of the Congested Districts Board carried out the duties which I have described. Their officers examined the tenants personally, and allotted the holdings to the best tenants available. It is well known to the noble Lords who have put these Questions that this whole transaction has been accompanied by the greatest difficulty, and. that must be taken into consideration when criticism is made upon the action of the Government in regard to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00739"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord appears to think that if he writes us a letter and gives us this information it is sufficient, but we have given him a considerable amount of notice regarding these Questions and he has all the machinery of his Office to get answers to them. As the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, has pointed out on former occasions, we are anxious to get the true facts of the case with regard to these things. The Questions are not put with a mischievous view, or with any intention of harrying the Secretary for Scotland or his Office, but with a real desire for information which will enable us at sonic future period to have a debate upon this subject. The information we are anxious to get is most important in order to enable us to carry out, our purpose.<lb/>
With regard to the first of the two remaining Questions which I have put down&#x2014;"Whether it is a fact that the school on Mingulay Island, the building of which cost the ratepayers over &#x00A3;700, has been closed owing to the exodus of the population"&#x2014;I would point out that this is a good school, but that owing to this exodus to a very considerable extent it has been closed, and owing to the number of crofters who have gone to Vatersay it is now necessary
<col>282</col>
to build a school there at a cost of about &#x00A3;1,200, which will also fall on the ratepayers. I am assured that the rate in Barra, which includes Vatersay and Mingulay and. all these islands, has gone up from 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> in the &#x00A3; and that the total rates will be something like 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>, as against 7<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> These people are only just able to keep themselves on their crofts, and the putting of a great number of people on the Island of Vatersay will bring up the rates to such an extent that the condition of the crofters and cotters on Barra as well as on Vatersay will be most serious. I ask the other two Questions that stand in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00740"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid it will take more argument than we can give to-night to this subject to secure any measure of agreement between the two sides of the House on this question, but I do wish most respectfully to remind the noble Lord again that the view he takes of this transaction is not the view of the Government. He referred to the action of the Government in putting a great number of people on this island. That is not how these people originally got on to the island. They raided the island when it was in the possession of the proprietor, and the proprietor for many months did nothing. There was a controversy between the proprietor and the Government as to what steps should be taken. I do not wish to revive old debates, but I must rebut the implication which the words of the noble Lord contained. The Government were forced by the circumstances to come to the rescue and the relief of these people, and it is not upon the Government that the responsibility rests for all this expenditure which the noble Lord points out must be incurred. The fact is that the Mingulay school is closed. I am not able to confirm the statement that it cost &#x00A3;700, or that the whole of this was borne by the ratepayers. These statements may be true, but I have not got any information at the moment which confirms them. The answer to the sixth Question is Yes; but the sanctioned cost is &#x00A3;1,000 for the school and the teacher's house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00741"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: I would like to explain that I am perfectly aware that the Government did not put these people on to the island. It was raided, as the noble Lord says, and as we all know. It was a slip of the tongue on my part;
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0146"/>
<col>283</col>
but the noble Lord caused action to be taken against these raiders. He got a decree against them, and on taking it further that was confirmed; and after that be allowed these people still to remain. I utterly fail to see the wisdom or the kindness of his action, because he put these men to great expense in defending themselves and then failed to carry out his own policy. It seems to me extraordinary weakness as much as anything else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00742"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must deprecate the continuance of this discussion. It is quite irregular.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CENSUS (GREAT BRITAIN) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00765">Amendments reported (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00766"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> moved to amend Clause 4, subsection (1), by omitting from paragraph (a) the words "religious profession," which were inserted in Committee on the motion of Lord Newton. The noble Lord said: My Lords, the object of my Amendment is to reverse the decision given by your Lordships' House a few days ago including in the provisions of this Bill the taking of a religious census. The House will recollect that in the course of the debate which took place on that occasion the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition spoke strongly in favour of Lord Newton's Amendment for the purpose of including a religious census, but at the close of his speech the noble Marquess somewhat obscurely hinted that if the Government should be firm on the question and should be unable to assent to the Amendment in another place he would advise the noble Lord to be content with the discussion which lie had raised and not divide the House. Later the noble Marquess, at the conclusion of the debate, put a pointed question to the Government, and the noble Earl who leads the House replied that it must be assumed that the Government would oppose the Amendment when it got to the other House.</p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0148"/>
<col>287</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00767">When the Division was called I observed that a kind of stampede took place on the Benches opposite. The leaders of the Party opposite who sit on the Front Opposition Bench left the House and took no part in the Division, and a great many of the Peers sitting behind them followed their example. Sufficient remained on the Back Benches, however, to enable Lord Newton to defeat the Government by a majority of seven, and to carry his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00768">I have consulted the Journals of the House, and I find that there were fifty-nine Peers who generally sit on the opposite side of the House who were present on that occasion but did not vote. It is, of course, possible that seine of them may have been called away on business and were unable to remain in the House, but it is quite certain that the great bulk of them abstained purposely from voting, and either left the House when the Division was called, or did not come in from the Library or the Lobbies in order to take part in the Division. It is certain, therefore, that a large majority of noble Lords sitting on the opposite side of the House were unwilling that the Division should take place, and the thirty-eight Members who supported the noble Lord's Amendment formed a minority of the Opposition Peers who were in the House on that occasion. Lord Newton will pardon me for saying that I think he was about the last person in the House who one would expect would lead a revolt of noble Lords sitting on the Back Benches against the advice of his leaders for the purpose of defeating the Government. The noble Lord has been a party to a Report on the constitution of this House, in which he admitted that the Government were entitled to a substantial support from the House; and I think if he will look at the names of those Peers who supported him in carrying his Amendment in Committee he will find that, with the exception of four or five, none of them would in all probability have seats in this House if the noble Lord's scheme were carried into effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00769">I must remind the House that what took place in the other House on this question was not dissimilar from that which occurred here, with the exception that the Government were not defeated. A similar Amendment was moved in the House of Commons, a long debate took place, and eventually
<col>288</col>
a Division was called, but there, just as here, the leaders of the Opposition left the House and took no part in the Division, and the minority who supported the Amendment was exactly the same as the number here&#x2014;namely, thirty-eight. Therefore it turns out that only thirty-eight members of the House of Commons out of a total membership of 670 voted for the Amendment, and only thirty-eight Peers out of a membership of 550 or 600 voted for the Amendment here. It is clear, therefore, that this Amendment would go to the other House with very small authority, and I take it to be beyond all question that it would not be accepted in the other House. I would venture, therefore, to suggest to the noble Lord and those who supported him whether it is really worth while that an Amendment of this kind, which has received such a small modicum of support, should be sent down to the House of Commons with a certainty that it will not be accepted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00770">On the merits of the case I will not detain the House at any length. I think the subject was very fairly and fully debated. But I should like to say, as a matter of personal justification for my action in raising the question again, that a good many years ago when I acted as President of the Statistical Society I gave a great deal of attention to the subject of a religious census, and I came to the conclusion, after long consideration, that it would be entirely misleading and of really no statistical value. It is absolutely certain that there are a very large number of people in this country, especially in the larger towns, who are not in the habit of attending any place of worship, and who cannot be said, therefore, to belong to any religious persuasion; but when asked the question whether they belong to any religious persuasion or not they would hesitate to say No, and would probably range themselves under the ample mantle of the Church of England. And by declaring themselves to be members of the Church of England they would not be asserting that which was untrue, because, in point of law, they are all members of the Church of England whether they wish it or not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00771">As an illustration I will quote the statistics which have been given in the Report of the Prisons Commissioners. In the case of the prisons there is already a religious census,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0149"/>
<col>289</col>
and the Report of the Prison Commissioners shows that out of the total number of 25,000 criminals, not in the convict prisons but in the ordinary prisons of Great Britain, on a particular day of the year mentioned, 16,000 declared themselves to be members of the Church of England, 5,000 declared themselves to be members of the Roman Catholic Church, about 1,500 to be members of the Presbyterian Church, 500 said they were Methodists, and there were about 120 belonging to other sects. Nobody for a moment believes that these statistics are of any value whatever. It is quite certain that a very large number of those criminals who described themselves as members of the Church of England for various reasons are persons with no religious persuasion of any kind, and who have only pronounced themselves to be members of the Church of England for some reason that one cannot exactly estimate. What has taken place in the case of criminals would probably take place in respect of a. very large number of people if this religious census is carried out. For my part I feel confident that the result will be misleading and of no value whatever, and will give a very misleading appreciation of the difference in numbers of the people belonging to the Church of. England and to other persuasions in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00772">For my part, therefore, I fully sympathise with the Nonconformists who have always strongly objected to this proposal for a religious census, and whose remonstrances hitherto have been listened to by both Parties in the State. The Conservative Governments in 1890 and 1900, in deference to the objections raised by Nonconformists, refrained from including a religious census in their Census Bills, and I feel very little doubt whatever that if the Party opposite were again in power and a census was to be taken, say in the year 1920, they would come to the same conclusion. At all events it is quite clear that the leaders of the Party opposite, in both Houses of Parliament, have been unwilling to commit themselves, by voting in favour of this Amendment, to any such policy in the future, and have kept themselves free to give any decision they may think fit; and I feel confident they will follow the example of all Governments for the last forty or fifty years and refrain from including a religious census in the ordinary census. I venture, therefore, to hope that
<col>290</col>
the noble Lord will take the advice on this occasion of the leaders on the Front Bench opposite, and that he will be satisfied with the discussion which has been raised and allow this Amendment to drop, and not put the other House to the inconvenience of having a further discussion on this matter. It is absolutely certain that if there is another discussion in the House of Commons the decision will be against this proposal by probably the same majority as before. In these circumstances I venture to move the Amendment standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00773">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>Clause 4, page 2, lines 3 and 4, leave out (" religious profession ").&#x2014;(<i>Lord Eversley.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00774"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the question of being satisfied as to the result of the discussion which took place upon this particular matter when the Bill was in Committee, I can assure the noble Lord opposite that I am amply satisfied, not only with the discussion but with the result. As far as the discussion went, the arguments being entirely upon one side it is not very probable that I should feel any dissatisfaction with regard to the course of the debate. But I cannot refrain front expressing my unbounded surprise at the action of the noble Lord, and I sincerely hope that the Amendment which he has put on the Paper will not be assented to by the House. The course which the noble Lord has taken is one which, perhaps, can be justified by precedent; but at the same time I submit that it is a course of an extremely unusual and unsatisfactory nature. If this practice were habitually adopted, it is quite evident that any noble Lord might lie low, so to speak, during the preliminary stages of a Bill, he might form an ambush, and one day he might come down with his friends and supporters on one of the subsequent stages of the Bill, when it was supposed to be in a perfectly safe condition, and either destroy it or mutilate it.<lb/>
I want to know, if this is a matter of such great importance, why it is that the Government are not able to protect themselves. If it is desirable that this provision should be excluded from the Bill, why is it that the Government not only have not done the work themselves, but, so far
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0150"/>
<col>291</col>
as I understand, have not even issued a Whip in support of the noble Lord? For a good many years, both in this and in the other House, I have sat opposite to the noble Lord who brought forward this Amendment, and I confess it never till this moment occurred to me to look upon him as otherwise than a serious politician. I now recognise him as a hardened practical joker. The noble Lord, in a spirit of irrepressible frivolity, comes down to the House and deliberately asks us to revise a decision at which we arrived the other day after two hours of about as serious and solid discussion as I have ever heard, conducted largely by right rev. Prelates, upon a question on which they have a right to be heard above any persons in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
Now the noble Lord comes down, and, in this airy and frivolous spirit, says that surely the Division of the other night ought not to count as a serious Division. The noble Lord says he has looked into the Division List and found that a number of noble Lords for whose opinion he has profound respect, including noble Lords on the Front Opposition Bench, did not vote for the Amendment. I am quite aware of that fact The Front Opposition Bench did not vote for a very excellent reason, because they have a proper sense of proportion, and because they do not wish to attach exaggerated importance to a question of this character. For the noble Lord to look into the Division List to search out the names of the people who voted and class them as, so to speak, political sheep and goats whose opinion is not to count at all, is a most unheard-of way of looking at a Division. I imagine that if there is a Division again the persons who abstained upon the last occasion will abstain again, and I do not blame them in the least for it.<lb/>
What I wish to call the attention of the House to is this, that the noble Earl the Leader of the House, in the course of his speech the other day, said that he did not regard this question as a Party question. The noble Earl having made that announcement, I felt that I was perfectly safe in asking the House to give its opinion on the subject. And let me say that I rather resent the charge made against me by the noble Lord that I am an undisciplined mutineer who leads astray persons
<col>292</col>
on the Back Benches and elsewhere. I wish I could. I wish I had the power. But I am of sufficiently modest a disposition to know that what I say probably carries remarkably little weight in this House or elsewhere. What pressure can I put on noble Lords to vote for me? Noble Lords sitting on this side of the House are just as capable of forming an intelligent opinion on this matter as Members of the House of Commons or as the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment. I did not ask them to go into the Lobby with me: they went of their own accord. And the noble Lord now comes down and says that because he does not approve of these names the Division is not to count and must be reversed.<lb/>
I wish to return to this point. The noble Earl told the House deliberately that this was not a Party question. Now are the Government going to take up the attitude that the moment this House ventures to express an opinion upon a question it immediately becomes a Party question? I believe most things of the Government, but I decline to believe that of them. I apologise for having caused all this trouble, but I do wish to point out that if we are going to do what the noble Lord wants we shall absolutely stultify ourselves. The noble Lord has not adduced any sort of argument in favour of reversing our decision. All lie says is that it is likely that upon this point we may find ourselves in disagreement with the House of Commons. It is possible that we may, and if we do find ourselves in disagreement with the House of Commons, then will be the time. to decide what we shall do. Meanwhile, why on earth should we be afraid of expressing our opinion, more especially when we have been told that this is not a Party question?<lb/>
For my part, I regret having put the House to this trouble, but at the same time I am not the least ashamed of my action in this matter. I am no more ashamed of what I have done than I should be of describing what my religious profession is upon the census sheet if I had the chance to do so. I repeat that if any persons have a right to be heard upon this question it is the occupants of the Episcopal Benches opposite. I do attach some value to consistency, and I cannot imagine anything much more undignified or more inconsistent than that this House
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0151"/>
<col>293</col>
should deliberately within the space of one week reverse a decision which it had previously arrived at. For that reason I regret to say that, although I am afraid my action may cause dissatisfaction, if I can find anybody to support my view I shall divide against the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00775"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who moved this Amendment referred so pointedly to the part which I took in the proceedings the other evening that I am constrained to say a very few words with regard to them. I shall not follow his example and again discuss the merits of the Amendment. They were fully entered into the other evening, and I remain of the opinion which I then expressed. I share the view of the noble Lord behind me with regard to the merits of the Amendment. Nor shall I follow the example&#x2014;not, I think, a very good example&#x2014;set us by the noble Lord at the Table (Lord Eversley) in pursuing his investigations into the composition of the Division List the other evening. Whatever may be in store for this House hereafter, at present we are all members of this House sitting in it on a footing of absolute equality, and I do not think the noble Lord or anybody else has a right to balance the intrinsic value of one Peer's vote against that of another.<lb/>
What happened the other evening was, I think, this. The noble Earl who leads the House, in reply to an interrogation from me, told us very distinctly that His Majesty's Government were not likely to accept the Amendment of my noble friend behind me. That being so, and it being also evident that this House was not likely to throw out the Census Bill altogether, it did appear to me that we were rather courting a rebuff by adding these words to the Bill, and I therefore said that for my part, and I believe some of my noble friends near me agreed with me, I should not vote for my noble friend whatever I might think with regard to the merits. But I can quite understand that my noble friend and other noble Lords should have thought differently, and that they should have desired by their votes to enter upon the proceedings of this House a protest against the attitude of His Majesty's Government. And having made that protest, I cannot see upon what ground they should be asked
<col>294</col>
this evening to retreat from the position which they then took up. I must say frankly that if I had been one of those who had made that protest, nothing would have induced me to withdraw from it now.<lb/>
This House has, after all, a right to express independent opinions of its own, and we all of us understand. I think, that there should be occasions when the body of the Peers may desire to take a line not perhaps entirely in accordance with that suggested to them from the Front Bench. The occasion of the Committee stage of this Bill, which was described by the noble Earl opposite as anything but a Party measure, was certainly one of those occasions when there was room for great latitude of opinion. I was not surprised that a variety of opinion should have been manifested. and I see no reason why those who then took a line different from that which was taken by the Front Opposition Bench should not adhere to the course which they then adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00776"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have sincerely to apologise to your Lordships for intervening in this discussion, especially after the speech a the noble Marquess who has just sat down. This is a question which has engaged the attention of the House of Commons during many decades, and has always been determined in one manner. The taking of a religious census has been proposed in connection with many Census Bills, but has always been rejected. I hope I may say a word or two upon the merits of this question. The narrow majority of seven surely justifies a reconsideration of the decision of your Lordships' House last week. Often upon Report a decision arrived at in Committee has been reconsidered.<lb/>
I will not enter into the composition of the majority or the minority, but I do ask the House, even those who voted with my noble friend Lord Newton, to consider what can be the result of the step that has been taken. My memory goes back vividly to the debate in the House of Commons in 1880, when a similar Amendment was proposed. The debate which then took place was one full of eloquence. I recollect the opposition to that clause by
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0152"/>
<col>295</col>
the Government representative, and I recollect a quotation from Voltaire when it was argued that you cannot find the religion of the people of this country. Voltaire said that England was a terrible country; it had 100 different religions and only one eatable sauce. I remember a magnificent speech delivered by Mr. John Bright on behalf of religious independence. He denounced the idea that any citizen had the right to ask a fellow citizen what his religious views were, and from that time to this the question has never been maintained with any force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00777"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: It is done in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00778"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: I will tell the noble Lord why it is done in Ireland. The arrangement exists there by agreement between the two parties. The Roman Catholics, being in an enormous majority throughout the country, wish this census because they desire to show how strong they are. The Protestants of Ireland, localised, wish to show how strong they are in their localities. The only people who could fight the Roman Catholic interest were the Ulster Protestants, and they said, "Give us this census so that we can show how strong Protestanism is in Ulster," and so it was done in Ireland by virtual agreement. I have stated that in 1880 this proposal was discouraged in the House of Commons. In 1890 a Conservative Government introduced a Census Bill, of which Mr. Ritchie had charge. An Amendment was moved to set up a religious census, but the Conservative Government of the day deprecated it on the ground that the country would not tolerate such a census, and the Amendment was withdrawn at the request of the Minister in charge of the Bill in the House of Commons. In 1900, again, a Conservative Government was in office. Mr. Chaplin had charge of the Bill on that occasion. This Amendment was moved by Lord Hugh Cecil, and Mr. Chaplin replied that it was useless, and that the matter had been determined and could not be reopened. Lord Hugh Cecil said he felt that that was so, and he yielded to the appeal of the Conservative leaders and withdrew his Amendment.<lb/>
In these circumstances I ask Lord Newton, does lie think there can be
<col>296</col>
any other result now after these constant decisions of the House of Commons and without any new argument whatever being brought forward in favour of this census. To be consistent the Conservative leaders in the House of Commons as well as the Government will have to oppose this Amendment. And what will be said then? It will be said that at a moment when there are delicate matters for consideration between the two Houses we are asserting this view by a narrow majority against the expressed will, over and over again asserted, of the House of Commons. I ventured to ask your Lordships some months ago to consider the action you were about to take. I did not expect that my words would be listened to then, and I do not expect they will be listened to to-night; but I think it is a calamity that, without any hope of success, you should in this way assert yourselves with nothing but futility. There are two great reasons against this religious census. In the first place, you cannot gain the information you wish to gain; and, in the next place, you ought not to gain it if you could.</membercontribution></p>

<col>297</col>
your Lordships will accept Lord Eversley's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00786"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble and learned Lord who has just spoken will not think me disrespectful if I do not follow him into the greater part of his speech. It was a speech which would have been perfectly in order on the Second Reading; but with regard to the Amendment now before the House, I think it was entirely apart from the question. The only part of the noble and learned Lord's remarks which appeared to me to relate to the question was this&#x2014;that he said it was undesirable that we in this House should express an opinion, and should give an effective expression of our opinion, if that opinion is different from the opinion of the majority of the House of Commons. Are we never, then, if we have a strong opinion, to give expression to it? Pray what is the use of this House? I am one of those who supported Lord Newton, and I quite fall in with what Lord Lansdowne said. Nothing in the world will induce me to say that the ease which I heard the other night was a good case against this Amendment.<lb/>
What decided me in voting with Lord Newton was the speech of the noble Earl the Lord President of the Council. No one has a greater respect than I have for his ability and the admirable way in which the noble Earl puts his cases; but when I listened to his ease and heard his arguments against a religious census I said to myself, "Well, if there is nothing better than this, clearly it is a case in which the merits are all on the other side." I do not wish to repeat what passed the other day. But what did the noble Earl say? He said this religious census would serve no useful purpose. The purpose, of course, is quite plain. The purpose for which this is desirable is with reference to the question of the disestablishment of the Church in Wales, which we have been told over and over again is going to be taken up in the immediate future. Then the noble Earl said that in Ireland the return was taken by enumerators, and he added that he did not expect that my noble friend behind me would think that there was much in that. My noble friend quite agreed with him. Then the noble Earl said that in Ireland there were 300 objectors in 1891, and that in the year 1901 there were 700 objectors.<lb/>
<col>298</col>
I do not think that really was a serious argument.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl said that if we wanted to know the real religious opinions of the people of Wales we ought to go to the Welsh Members. I have a great respect for the Welsh Members, but I do not think that either their very best friend or their greatest enemy would impute to them the charge of being impartial. And with regard to their representing the opinion of all Wales, I see Lord Courtney in his place, and I am sure that that ardent apostle of proportional representation will at once rise and say that there probably is not a minority so badly represented or so unduly misrepresented as is the case in Wales under the present system. I really heard no argument from the Government at all, and therefore I voted with my noble friend Lord Newton. Why am I to change my opinion? Am I to say I think a good case was made out when I think there was no case at all made out? And why are we always to be talking and always to be thinking of what is going to happen in the House of Commons? The House of Commons is perfectly well able to take care of itself. I am sure we have seen plenty of proof of that. Suppose we adhere to this Amendment of my noble friend. It goes to the House of Commons. The House of. Commons will pronounce its opinion with regard to the Amendment. Very likely&#x2014;most likely, perhaps&#x2014;it will disagree with this House. Then will be the time for your Lordships to consider whether you are going to adhere to the Amendment with the possible result of losing the Bill, or whether you will give it up. But if your Lordships then give it up, you will, at all events, have shown this, that there is no case whatsoever against the Amendment. All Lord Newton's Amendment does is to say that a man, if he wishes, may record what his religious profession is, and, if he does not choose to record it, he need not. It is said that under no circumstances can this be agreed to, and that no useful purpose will be served, when at the same time in the other House the Welsh Members are pressing upon the Government to disestablish the Church in Wales. For that reason it is very desirable that anything we can obtain in the direction of impartial and accurate information on this subject should be obtained. I submit that there is an over-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0154"/>
<col>299</col>
whelming case for the Amendment we inserted in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00787"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would scarcely be respectful to your Lordships' House if His Majesty's Government allowed this interesting discussion to go by without expressing some opinion on the question which your Lordships are now discussing. It has been stated by the noble Lord who originally was responsible for the Amendment inserting the words "religious profession"&#x2014;and we on this side of the House entirely agree with him&#x2014;that this is not, strictly speaking, a Party question. This is a matter of administration; and I would point out to the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition what an admirable example this is of the constant difficulty which His Majesty's Government meet with in trying to carry on the administration of the country, being a Liberal minority in a Conservative House of Lords. Here are His Majesty's Government introducing a Bill, exactly the same, so far as regards this point, as the Bill for which the noble Marquess was responsible in 1890 and 1900; and although it is the same, without any fresh facts or any fresh circumstances having taken place in the interval, when His Majesty's Government now bring in an exactly identical Bill, the noble Marquess's followers refuse to give approval to it. Surely it is all the stronger because it is not a Party question but a matter of administration; and I do not know that we can find a better example of the difficulties which His Majesty's Government have in carrying on the administration of this country.<lb/>
I venture to think that this opposition is really entirely factious, and the noble Lord, I think, hardly expects that he will be able to secure that religious census which is really the subject of our discussion. I am afraid I am hardly able to follow the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition in his theory that on such an occasion as this the body of the House has an opinion which deserves to be supported without criticism, and for this reason. The body of the House took no part, or very little part, in the discussion, and took a very small part in the Division on this Amendment. Only seventy members of your Lordships' House out of a total membership of 600 voted upon the question, and I do not think, when you consider that out of that number only thirty-eight voted in favour of the Amend-
<col>300</col>
ment, that that can be described as being the body of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
May I say, in passing, that if this House adheres to the Amendment which was carried in Committee there are one or two drafting Amendments which I should like to put down for the consideration of your Lordships on Third Reading. They are purely drafting, and are not in any way meant to minimise the effect of the noble Lord's Amendment; but as the Amendment has been carried by this House it is thought, and I think rightly thought, that it should go to another place in a proper shape which should not be disapproved of by the draftsman. The noble Lord asked us why no Whip was issued on this occasion. I think the answer to that is that the Amendment of Lord Eversley only appeared on the Paper this morning, and therefore it was not possible. May I say one or two words in answer to the noble Earl who has just sat down, whose flattering remarks I should like to thank him for. But I cannot expect to succeed where the late Lord Salisbury failed. The noble Earl himself tried to persuade Lord Salisbury to include a religious census on a previous occasion&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00788"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I think if the noble Earl will refer back he will see that what Lord Salisbury objected to was not my proposal but the time at which it was made. The Bill was not before the House. What I suggested to the House was that when the Bill came up a column should be inserted containing this religious matter. The late Lord Salisbury stated that that, in his opinion, was not according to order, and Lord Granville said the same, and the Motion was then withdrawn. That is what happened.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00789"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I agree. But why did not the noble Earl proceed with the matter on a more suitable occasion when the Bill did come before your Lordships' House? I can only imagine that the noble Marquess, who threw cold water on the noble Earl's proposal, was so effective in the ridicule which he poured upon it as to deter the noble Earl from bringing it forward on a subsequent occasion. May I say that this Amendment is not likely to give us any really useful statistics with regard to disestablishment. In Wales the mere fact that a man is a member of the Church of England will not necessarily make him for or against
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0155"/>
<col>301</col>
any particular Bill. Because a man is a member of the Roman Catholic Church he will not necessarily be for or against the disestablishment of the Church of England, and you cannot be sure when you have got the religion of the people that you can tell what their attitude will be with regard to a measure which is wholly political in its character. The disestablishment of the Church is really a political matter, and the religious opinions of the people do not necessarily have any relation to the political standing of the Church. That is why I think we are justified in taking the opinion of the Members of the House of Commons, who are returned as the representatives of the people, as being more likely to afford a real guide as to the wishes of the people of Wales than would their religious opinions.<lb/>
But I cannot sit down without expressing regret at the attitude which was taken up by right rev. Prelates. It seems to me a matter of deep regret that right rev. Prelates should have used their privileged position in this House to try and force upon the people of this country an inquiry into their religious convictions which is very much objected to by a large section of Nonconformists up and down the country; and I cannot help hoping that before the matter is finally decided, when I suppose it will come back again from another place, right rev. Prelates will see their way to withdraw their opposition to the Bill as it was originally introduced by His Majesty's Government. This matter, of course, is one for your Lordships' House, and His Majesty's Government do not propose to take any active steps upon the present occasion. Their Bill as it was approved of by previous Governments has been before your Lordships' House, and they leave it to your Lordships to act as you think best after they have placed their views in the Committee stage before you. Whether your Lordships prefer to experience at the hands of the other House a rebuff, which seems to be anticipated, I think, by every single speaker who has taken part in this debate, or whether you will yourselves delete this Amendment is a matter to which His Majesty's Government are comparatively indifferent, and which they leave entirely in the hands of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00790"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. DAVID'S</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the challenge which the noble
<col>302</col>
Earl the Lord President threw out to the occupants of these Benches compels me to make one or two observations. It is, I think, always accepted that duty is the correlative of privilege, and if we hold a privileged position in this House I conceive we should try to the best of our ability to do our duty. I do not quite follow the noble Earl's criticism, for I understood that the noble Lord who carried this Amendment last week carefully provided that any one who did not wish to return his 'religious profession need not do so. It is based absolutely on the voluntary principle, which I am quite sure the noble Earl in many applications approves of. Then I was very much astonished at the noble Earl's argument. He said that the Government thought that the opinion of the Welsh Members of Parliament was a great argument for their great project. If they had remained content with that argument, we should have had nothing to do but to meet them on that ground. But they did not do so. The Prime Minister, in introducing the Welsh Disestablishment Bill, certainly did quote the opinions of the Welsh Members of Parliament, but he also quoted statistics. Our contention is that the argument of statistics is a feeble and irrelevant argument for breaking up the historic unity of the Church of England; but if you use the argument of statistics, then you ought to take every possible pains to have that argument fair and sound. I do not intend to trespass upon the time of your Lordships by entering into the merits of the question, but may I quote a precedent? Last week was not the first time your Lordships carried this Amendment. It was carried in 1870 by a majority of four, and no one on that occasion took the course which the noble Lord at the Table has taken to-night of asking the House to change its opinion within a week. What happened then was that the Amendment carried in this House was not accepted in another place; reasons were given for not accepting it, and this House did not insist upon the Amendment. After what the noble Earl said I felt bound to say a few words by way of meeting his challenge. I hope your Lordships will support Lord Newton's proposal to-night as you did last week.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00797">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00798"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill, which I beg leave to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this afternoon, is a Bill to amend the Midwives Act which was passed in the year 1902. That Act set up a precedent in a good many directions, and, as is often the case with new legislation, experience has shown that it is desirable that there should be amendment in one or two directions. It is in order to carry out these amendments that this Bill is introduced. There are one or two results which I should like to mention to your Lordships; they are partly the effect, I think, of the Midwives Act of 1902.<lb/>
During the last few years there has been a remarkable decrease in deaths of a character which might be prevented by competent and skilled midwives. We do not by any means wish your Lordships to imagine that we ascribe the whole of
<col>304</col>
this to the Midwives Act, but we say that this is one of the various tendencies all working in the same direction. In the year 1902, before this Act came into force, there were 2,000 deaths from puerperal sepsis, and the rate per million of women living was 118. In the year 1908 the figure had gone clown to 76 per million women living, which is a very considerable reduction. Taking the rate of mortality in the same disease calculated in proportion to 1,000 births, the figure has gone down from 2&#x00B7;12 to 1&#x00B7;48, which, again, is a considerable decrease. The death-rate per thousand births from puerperal sepsis and accidents in child-birth in 1902 was 4&#x00B7;6; last year it was only 3&#x00B7;57. So that your Lordships will see there has been a very real and considerable decrease since the Act of 1902 came into force. A Departmental Committee was appointed to see how far the Act had been a success, and the amendments embodied in this Bill are substantially founded on the recommendations of the Departmental Committee.<lb/>
I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the admirable work which is being performed by Sir Francis Champneys, the Chairman of the Midwives Board, who has devoted a large amount of time to successfully working the Act. The discharge of their functions by the Board has, I think, earned general commendation, and that is very largely due to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0157"/>
<col>305</col>
the judgment and tact shown by the 'Chairman, upon whom His Majesty was lately pleased to bestow a Baronetcy. During the whole of the seven years Sir Francis Champneys has devoted his time and energy unremittently to the service of the Board over which he presides, and I am sure your Lordships will agree that it is fortunate that the Board should have bad the guidance of a man who at once enjoys the confidence of the medical profession and has a disinterested care for the objects of the law which the Board is called upon to administer.<lb/>
I now come to the clauses in the Bill. The first clause deals with the constitution of the Board. With regard to that matter I may say at once that a considerable quantity of correspondence has reached me on this subject, and representations have been made by various bodies, some of which are anxious to increase their representation on the Board. That is not, strictly speaking., I suppose, a Second Reading matter, but rather one to be dealt with in Committee: but in this matter I shall throw myself wholly upon your Lordships' mercy. Nobody who has had experience of this matter can be ignorant of the fact that there is nothing more difficult in the world than to secure the properly-balanced proportion of various interests on a body that you want to be thoroughly representative of those various interests. There are a number of considerations to be taken into account, and the nicely balancing of the various interests concerned makes it very often a difficult matter, and if once you admit any alteration in the scheme it is very difficult indeed to know where to stop. Admit one alteration and then the other bodies concerned come and ask for further alteration. That becomes an exceedingly difficult matter, and I wish, if any noble Lord is going to move an Amendment on Clause 1, that he could be persuaded at the same time to explain to your Lordships how he would also deal with the other interests concerned. It is easy enough to move that a certain body should have representation, but the effect which that must have on the other interests concerned should be explained. And therefore I hope that if any Amendment of that kind is discussed it may be combined with a general scheme for the reorganisation of the Board.<lb/>
I might mention, in case any noble Lord has any fears with regard to this, that we
<col>306</col>
have in the second clause a provision under which the Privy Council, if after a certain length of time they find the various bodies are not sufficiently represented, take power, after bringing the matter before your Lordships' House, to alter the constitution of the Board. In this matter we follow the precedent in the Medical Act of 1886, which has been found to work satisfactorily. Your Lordships will see that if we find after the Act has been working for some time that there is any real ground for complaint, we take power to make an alteration in any direction which may seem advisable. In Clause 3 we deal with the finance of the Bill, and after the discussion which we had last week on the subject of the rates I am anxious to explain to your Lordships that it really is not a very large charge that we propose should be borne by the rates of this country. Take the Report of the Departmental Committee which went into the question, and your Lordships will there see in parallel columns, on page 33, the amount which is paid by the various authorities under the existing scheme, and alongside of it the amount which would be paid if the scheme which is proposed in this Bill were adopted in its place. I will take the large county of London. London would have to pay an amount of only &#x00A3;77 11s. 8d., and that on the rates of London does not involve a serious or heavy charge. I next take my own county, which is a rural county. The county of Worcester would pay &#x00A3;34, which, again, even in the case of a rural county, cannot be described as a large amount to pay for the benefits derived from this Act.<lb/>
Clause 7 is, perhaps, the next important clause, and that provides for the imposition of an annual registration fee of a shilling upon every midwife who wishes to keep her name on the roll. The Committee were informed that the roll was not in a satisfactory condition, and we think that by imposing this fee, which is not a large one, we shall be enabled to keep the roll better, and that the midwives will derive benefit from their names being upon the roll. Your Lordships will see that under the general scheme of the Act the midwives enjoy a monopoly of practice, and I do not think it is very much to ask them to pay this fee considering the advantages which they get from the existence of the Act.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0158"/>
<col>307</col>
Then we come to Clause 17, which deals with a difficulty of perhaps the greatest importance. Under the rules of the Central Midwives Board a midwife was required, if she noticed certain symptoms of danger or complication, to advise the woman or her relations to send for a doctor. Her responsibility was entirely confined to giving that advice, and she was not hound to secure the doctor's attendance, although as a matter of practice she very often was willing to relieve the family of trouble by communicating with the doctor herself. But the difficulty which arose was this, that the doctor who so attends is at present under no secure expectation of receiving payment for his professional services, and in some cases the medical man has refused to attend unless his fee is paid beforehand. In other cases he has only attended after so much delay that the life and health of the mother and child may have been in danger. Apart from this there has been a movement set on foot by which medical men have pledged themselves not to attend in such cases unless the fee was either paid beforehand or guaranteed by some responsible authority. The Local Government Board issued a Circular in 1907 on the subject, but the matter has been dealt with in different ways. In Liverpool and Manchester the city councils have taken the matter into their own hands, and have provided for the payment of doctors called in under such circumstances; but that is purely a voluntary proceeding on their part; and what is applicable in a city like Manchester or Liverpool is not applicable in a large and scattered area. A considerable volume of evidence was laid before the Departmental Committee on this question, and it was quite conclusive as to the necessity of some intervention by the State so that a doctor&#x2014;and I think quite rightly&#x2014;should be assured of receiving his fee from some public authority if he could not secure it from the woman or her relations. The only question which was at all open to doubt was with regard to the particular authority which should make the payment, and the Local Government Board, in a Memorandum, expressed themselves very strongly in favour of designating boards of guardians as the responsible authority.<lb/>
This particular provision was subjected to very severe criticism in the original form in which the Bill was introduced by my noble friend Lord Wolverhampton,
<col>308</col>
and as it stands in the present Bill Your Lordships will see that some alterations, which I hope will be considered important, have been introduced. Clause 17 provides that where a duly qualified medical practitioner has been summoned upon the advice of a certified midwife attending a woman in child-birth to render assistance in a case of emergency, he shall be entitled to recover from the board of guardians of the Poor-law union in which the woman resides such fee in respect of his attendance as may be prescribed; and such fee may, if the board of guardians think fit, be recovered summarily as a civil debt from the patient or person liable to provide the patient with medical aid. Relief of this nature, whether recovered or not, will no in any case entail disfranchisement, and we hope there will be no disagreeable incident connected with it. If no provision was made for the recovery of the money, gratuitous medical attendance at the cost of the State would for the first time be introduced, and whether that be right or wrong it did not seem that an amending Bill of this nature was the proper occasion for allowing such a provision to be entered on the Statute Book. An endeavour has been made to make this Bill as far as possible non-contentious by avoiding raising any large issues connected with Poor-law relief, and I hope the course we have taken will secure that result.<lb/>
The other matter to which, perhaps, I ought to allude is one which is not directly referred to in the Bill, but one upon which some communications have reached me. I refer to the omission from the Bill of any reference to Ireland. I would point out that one reason why there is no mention of Ireland in this Bill is that this is an amending measure. We only propose to amend the Act of 1902, within the scope of which Ireland was not included. As Ireland was not brought within the scope of that Act it is not desirable in an amending Act to introduce any new principle, or such a great change as the inclusion of Ireland would be. That is the first reason we have for not including Ireland in this Bill. Our second reason is that the system in Ireland is quite different. In that country there are dispensary midwives, and we do not think it would be easy to work that system in connection with the Central Midwives Board in London. But if any noble Lord would introduce a Bill relating specifically to

The original Bill was introduced into this House in March of this year, so that I do not think we can be accused of dealing with this matter with unnecessary or undue hurry.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00802"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have intervened in this debate had I not received representations from Belfast bringing before me reasons why it is hoped that the case of Ireland will be considered in connection with this measure, and that benefits similar to those which this country will receive from the passing of this Bill will be extended to Ireland. The subject is not an entirely new one with regard to Ireland. A Question was put to the Chief Secretary in another place, and he replied&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not propose to introduce legislation on the subject, at all events during the present session. 1 would point out that there is not the same urgency in the matter in Ireland as in England, having regard to the powers boards of guardians in Ireland already possess."</quote>
I do not think that answer would satisfy the gentlemen in the North of Ireland who have brought their case before me, claiming that Ireland beyond all doubt ought to have the same benefits as are proposed in this Bill with regard to England. The noble Earl said that the Act of 1902 did not include Ireland. I cannot agree with that statement. If the noble Earl
<col>310</col>
will refer to the Act of 1902 he will see that Section 2 included a certain amount of relief for the people of Ireland, but it was provisional for only two years, and. after the two years Ireland was left entirely out of the benefit of the Act. It is on these grounds that these gentlemen ask that their claim may be recognised at the present moment.<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to allow me to read an epitome of what was put before me when I was in Ireland. I ask for that indulgence because your Lordships never like any document to be read, but my frends who put before me very clearly their requirements only sent me their views in writing shortly before I entered your Lordships' House, and although I have run through the epitome of what they want I have not got the points clearly in my mind. Therefore I ask your Lordships to allow me to read the views they put forward. The reasons the Irish people think they have a grievance at the present moment are as follow. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"At the present time the Midwives Act only applies to England. By this Act it is enacted that after April 1, 1910, it is an offence for any woman not a legally qualified medical practitioner, unless certified under the Act, to attend women in childbirth, habitually and for gain, except under the direction of a medical practitioner, unless in case of emergency, under a penalty not exceeding 220. The result is that a fully-trained Irish midwife who has passed the examination and holds the certificate of an Irish Maternity Hospital, suffers no disability so long as she is attending a case along with a doctor; but if she has not, in addition to an Irish midwifery diploma, the certificate of the Central Midwives Board, she is not legally qualified to conduct cases herself in England, nor to accept an appointment as midwife under the local supervising authority of an English county, a borough, or an urban or rural district. If she attempts to do so, notwithstanding that she holds an Irish midwifery certificate, she is liable to be penalised.</quote>
<quote>"Also it is now an almost universal requirement in advertisements fur appointments in the Colonies that the State degree must be held. Unless, therefore, an Irish midwife is prepared to go to the expense and inconvenience of crossing to England, remaining there for ten days, and spending money for a diploma, thus contributing to the support of the English Board, she is practically debarred from receiving a Colonial appointment. Further, the military authorities at the Curragh when advertising for a midwife in this, the very centre of Ireland, require that she should hold a diploma from the Central Midwives Board.</quote>
<quote>"The injustice is all the more pronounced since the Irish midwifery training is even more thorough than that given in England. The Central Midwives Board in England require a period of only three months study, while in the Rotunda Hospital, the Belfast Maternity Hospital, and all other training schools in Ireland a six months period is the length required. Further, the Central Midwives Board
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0160"/>
<col>311</col>
require only fifteen lectures to be given to midwives, while in the Irish Maternities the number of lectures is greater, the pupil midwives are more closely supervised, they have opportunities of seeing more cases, and are trained only in sufficient numbers for the efficient care of he patients in the Irish Maternities; in other words, no nurses are trained who are not kept busy constantly throughout the whole six months course.</quote>
<quote>"These facts show that the Irish certificated midwives have a distinct grievance, and that the limitation of the Act to England inflicts upon these trained midwifes a clear injustice. The remedy lies either in introducing a Midwives Bill for Ireland, though from Mr. Birrell's answer to a recent Question in the House of Commons there would seem to be but little prospect of this, or an Amendment might be made to the present measure providing that the Central Midwives Board in England shall certify those Irish certificated midwives who apply, so long as the training and examination for the Irish certificate does not fall below the standard adopted by the English Board. The latter would seem to be the easier method of removing what must be acknowledged to be an unmerited restriction on trained and certificated Irish midwives."</quote>
I do not propose to say any more in bringing under your Lordships' notice this document, except to express the hope that after what the noble Earl has said he will consider the points I have ventured to read to him, and will hold out a hope to Ireland that something will be done by the Government to do away with what seems to me unfair treatment and hardship on these Irish midwives.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00803"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I wish to support in every way the speech which has been made by my noble friend who has just sat down. He said very much what I intended to say in support of the view that this Bill should be extended to Ireland. I am fortified in the opinion that it would be well to do so from communications I also have received from people who are very well able to judge. The Royal College of Physicians, the Academy of Medicine, the Rotunda Hospital and the other medical bodies in Ireland are all in favour of this, and I may say I have received a letter from Sir William Smyly, the eminent physician in Dublin, in which he says&#x2014;
<quote>"The Act is a good and useful one, and will tend to reduce the mortality from puerperal fever in England. In this country Ireland, the deaths from this cause are lamentably frequent. The inclusion of this country under the Midwives Act would be of the greatest importance, and as the Act is at present undergoing revision in the House of Lords it appears to be a favourable time to propose that it should be extended to Ireland."</quote>
I think that is a manifest proof that it would be of great advantage to Ireland to
<col>312</col>
have the Act extended to it. I have heard it stated that there are difficulties in the way, owing to the fact that the Privy Council in this country have no jurisdiction in Ireland; but surely this might be met by the Privy Council here appointing certain qualified people in Ireland&#x2014;say, for instance, three to be appointed by the Local Government Board, one of whom should be a woman, and the other two medically qualified, and one duly qualified medical practitioner to be appointed by the College of Physicians.<lb/>
There is no doubt about the question that my noble friend raised with regard to the present position of Irish nurses. I may say that I received very much the same kind of memorandum from the Rotunda Hospital&#x2014;it is almost in the same words&#x2014;as that which the noble Marquess read, pointing out the excessively unfavourable position in which these midwives, who have been trained in a school certainly second to none, are placed. As my noble friend stated, the military authorities at the Curragh when advertising for a midwife require that she should hold a diploma from the Central Midwives Board, thereby excluding Irish midwives. I feel so strongly on this that I should like at the next stage of the Bill to propose an Amendment which would as far as possible bring Ireland within the scope of this Bill. The matter is so important and affects Ireland so closely that I hope His Majesty's Government will either consent to this, or will introduce a Bill for Ireland separately. If the Government will undertake to bring in a Bill with the same provisions as in this Bill and affording perfectly reciprocal treatment to nurses in England and Ireland, the end will be attained. But when will that take place? How long may we have to wait before a Bill is introduced by His Majesty's Government? That is a point to be considered. I hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will look indulgently on the Amendment that I intend, in Committee, to propose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00804"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a few words with regard to this Bill. First of all, let me congratulate the noble Earl on his very clear description of the Bill. I quite understand that this is an amending Bill, amending the Act of 1902, and I appreciate the difficulty there would be in applying the whole of the Bill to Ireland. Let me say&#x2014;and I say it with some pride&#x2014;that we consider the midwives
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0161"/>
<col>313</col>
in Ireland more highly trained at present than are the midwives in this country. That is to say, they have received a longer training in the Rotunda and the Coombe Lying-In Hospitals. I quite appreciate that to propose to apply the whole of the Bill to Ireland would at this stage of the session jeopardise the Bill; but I think the noble Earl might consider the possibility of inserting an amendment allowing midwives who possess the diploma from these hospitals in Dublin to be engaged as Army nurses, to be employed in the Colonies, and to take their position in this country in the same way as English midwives. That seems to be a provision which would not in any way interfere with the whole scheme of this very important Bill. But, as I have said, I quite follow that applying the whole Bill to Ireland would require a great many changes throughout the Bill. I hope that before we decide on the Second Reading of the Bill, the noble Earl will tell us what his views and the views of the Government are with regard to the particular Amendment which I have foreshadowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00805"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is considerable feeling in reference to this Bill in Ireland, not at all by way of disapproval of its provisions or of its excellent objects, but there is a strong feeling that in this case injustice is being done to a large and deserving class in Ireland. It is true that Irish midwives were left out of the Act of 1902 on representations being made not at all dissimilar to those which are now presented from the Government Bench. Nothing has since been done. And now when an amending Bill is proposed covering modifications and developments the Irish nurses who are affected find that still nothing is done for them.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred to the introduction of a Bill relating specifically to Ireland, and said that if any noble Lord would bring forward such a Bill the Government would place at his disposal all their information concerning the subject. That is not exactly treating us as if we were unwise, but it is not a practical way of dealing with the question. Even to bring in another Government Bill limited to Ireland would not meet the case. If a separate Bill were brought: in with reference to Ireland it might be dropped, or it might not be pressed on with the same insistence that is going to be applied to this Bill. I can see no practical difficulty in so amending this Bill
<col>314</col>
as to extend such of its provisions as can reasonably be extended to Ireland. The noble Lord behind me (Lord Clonbrock) has indicated that he proposes to place. Amendments on the Paper. I am sure the noble Earl will consider them and see if they cannot with advantage be introduced into the Bill. But everything depends on the point of view. If the Amendments are read with a view to giving reasons for not adopting them that is one point of view, and a very easy one for those to take who object to them; but if they are read with the object of seeing how many of these Amendments can be fairly introduced and seeking at the same time to satisfy the natural wishes of Ireland on the subject, that is another point of view.<lb/>
It is to be borne in mind that although this discussion is important, and although I can see the reasonableness of the noble Earl wishing to pass the stages of this Bill before the adjournment which will now take place very soon, that does not mean the end of the Bill. It has then to go elsewhere and there are many people there who will have their attention directed to this question in as full a way as the attention of some members of this House has been directed to this matter; and I have no doubt that if the case of Ireland is not earnestly considered with a view to adopting some of the Amendments moved, it will be found that the Bill may not have as rapid a progress elsewhere as is desired. I merely say that to indicate that I think there are many reasons which should induce the Government to consider this question, not only with an open, but with a favourable mind. I do not think it would be fair to ask the noble Earl now to indicate in any detail what he would be prepared to do, but I think he might, when he reads the Amendments of my noble friend Lord Clonbrock on the Paper, consider them with a fair and reasonable mind, in concert with his advisers, and with a desire to meet the case of Ireland as far as he possibly can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00806"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, rise to say a very few words with regard to this Bill, and I shall not express any opinion as to the expediency in the abstract of extending the operation of the principal Act to Ireland. From all I hear, similar provisions to this Bill would be welcomed in Ireland; but I think there would be considerable technical difficulties in fitting this Bill, which is an amending
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0162"/>
<col>315</col>
Bill to the Act now on the Statute Book, to the circumstances of Ireland. I speak with some knowledge on that point, because had the privilege of piloting the original Bill through this House, and at that time I knew perhaps better than I do at the moment the technical difficulties of applying the same certifying authority to both England and Ireland, and, as a matter of fact, to Scotland.<lb/>
As one of those responsible for the original Act I heard with the greatest possible pleasure the satisfactory statement of the noble Earl of the results of the operation of that Act during the past five or six years. It seemed to me to be extremely satisfactory and to entirely justify those of us who were responsible for the original Board; and I think the noble Earl did no more than justice in paying what was really a well-deserved tribute to the chairman who has given the most self-denying service to the work of the Board. The noble Earl passed in review some of the clauses of this Bill. I think I appreciate the motives of the noble Earl in withdrawing his predecessor's Bill and bringing in a new one. There were a certain number of Amendments suggested to that Bill, and I think probably on the whole it was a convenient course to the House and more satisfactory to himself that lie should bring in a new Bill rather than attempt to amend the Bill of the noble Viscount. Lord Wolverhampton, in light of the criticisms which it had provoked.<lb/>
But, my Lords, undoubtedly on some points some of those keenly interested in Lord Wolverhampton's Bill are rather dissatisfied with the amount of effect which their representations have had, and to this extent they think they have a grievance. I do not express an opinion upon it myself. I merely am acting as the mouthpiece for others. The Bill of the noble Viscount having been long before the House and the public and then withdrawn, it was hoped that larger changes would be made in it; and bringing it in at this period of the session in a renewed form and proposing to pass it through this House in some eight to ten days has an appearance, at any rate, of not being altogether fair to those who did not know what was likely to be done when the former Bill was withdrawn. I do not express an opinion. I merely say that these criticisms are made, and I think that if the noble Earl perseveres in his intention to pass the Bill through this House next
<col>316</col>
week, he will find those criticisms more loudly expressed by other noble Lords.<lb/>
I am bound to say that so far as Clause 17 is concerned&#x2014;the clause which makes provision for the recovery of the medical fees&#x2014;I venture to agree with the noble Earl that that clause is a great improvement on its predecessor. The noble Earl in calling attention to the amendment which lie has made, clearly stated the undoubted difficulties which surround the whole subject.; and it is very satisfactory to me, at any rate, and I think to most of those who are interested in the subject, that what I would venture to call the Poor-law taint has been very largely removed. It was one of the points in Lord Wolverhampton's Bill more adversely criticised than any other, and I am bound to say that in the main I agreed in that criticism. But the Poor-law taint is not altogether removed. No penalty attaches to the fact that the family may not be able to pay the doctor's fee, but there is still the undoubted disadvantage that that money has to be found through the Poor-law authority. I am not sufficiently versed in English local government to express a confident opinion as to whether any better substitute can be found. I think it is much more a point for Committee than Second Reading, and I content myself with saying that I rejoice at the direction in which Amendments have been inserted. They are undoubtedly a great improvement on the Bill as it stood although I venture to think the provisions are not yet wholly satisfactory.<lb/>
There is one other point on which I want to say a word&#x2014;namely, as to the representation of various bodies upon the Board. The noble Earl threw himself upon the sympathy of the House, and I think the difficulty of deciding between the conflicting claims of various people, all of whom think they ought to have a majority on the Board, will be admitted by any one who has had experience of such matters. The noble Earl said to those of us who are not satisfied with the present constitution of the Board, "If you are going to make a change in one particular, you must make a corresponding change so as to keep up the balance over the whole Board." That would have been a very fair challenge if he had told us the reasons which had satisfied him in producing these provisions in the Bill, but it can hardly be said that criticism is not justified unless you are prepared
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0163"/>
<col>317</col>
to produce a wholly complete scheme when you are in ignorance of the reasons uppermost in the minds of those who proposed the scheme before us; and it does seem to me&#x2014;and this is the only criticism I shall venture to make&#x2014;that the certified midwives; are rather shabbily treated in only having two representatives, one of whom is to be a. certified midwife. I should have hoped that an additional one might have been added to their representation, so that they, the body so largely concerned with the administration of the Bill, might have had larger representation on the central authority. I fully agree, however, having made that remark, that it is much better that it should be left over for those who are more deeply concerned in it than I am to make the exact suggestion as to the representation which they would like to have on the Board.<lb/>
There is one other matter. I venture to think that the noble Earl has not paid quite sufficient attention to some of the representations made. I refer to Clause 11, the notification clause. It must, I think, be obvious that many of those actually concerned and practising as midwives are not highly skilled in technical forms, and to impose two or three different forms of notification upon them seems to me to require rather more justification than has yet been given. I frankly admit that this clause is an improvement upon its predecessor. The time before which a practising midwife has to give notice has been extended, and the penalty has been reduced; therefore it is not quite so drastic or terrible an engine as it appeared in the former Bill. But many of these women, excellent as they are in the practice of their profession, are not skilled in filling up forms and giving notices, and I venture to say that the requirements as to this class of writing work should be made as easy and as gentle as possible.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, those who have made representations to me are also afraid that the particular provisions of Clause 11 will have a very detrimental effect upon the employment of midwives when a doctor is in attendance. It is, of course, an advantage that the nurse who is attending along with the doctor in a case of confinement should as often as possible be a certified midwife, but if all the obligations laid upon certified midwives are to be put upon them even when they are in attendance along with a doctor, it seems to me that the
<col>318</col>
certain result will be that you will place them at a. disadvantage and recourse will be again bad by the doctors to the employment of women as monthly nurses who are not certified midwives. The only quotation I shall read is a representation which has been made to me on the point that I have endeavoured to explain to the House. It is this&#x2014;
<quote>"We suggest that the only effect of this clause will be to induce medical men to abstain altogether from their growing practice of employing a certified midwife as monthly nurse, for the clause operates to compel the certified midwife, under penalties, to report the medical man for being absent front whatever cause at the minute of birth."</quote>
If the monthly nurse is not a midwife and not endowed with that power and not put under that obligation, it is quite obvious, it seems to me, that medical men not of the first class will have a tendency to run the risk mentioned. The result of that will be to the disadvantage of the population, and will tend to annul to some extent the advantages of the existing Act which the noble Earl laid before us. I have, perhaps, gone rather too much into detail; but, as your Lordships know, I shall not have, or it is most unlikely that I shall have, the opportunity of speaking at the subsequent stage, and so I thought it best to make these criticisms for the purpose of showing the noble Earl the sort of questions he is likely to have to meet in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00807"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have every reason, I think, to be grateful for the reception which has been given to this Bill. The danger, it seems to me, is that the Bill is likely to be smothered with too much kindness in the anxiety of noble Lords opposite to apply it to Ireland. As to the application of this Bill to Ireland, I think the position is this. The original Act may be described as having a double effect, first of all as a scheme for the general benefit of the country, and also having regard to the individual qualifications of the midwife. With regard to the first, I venture to think there would be serious difficulty in applying this amending Bill to Ireland, or applying the scheme of the original Act through an amending Bill to the whole of that country. But if the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, would be good enough to draw up some Amendments, I can assure him they will receive very careful attention.<lb/>
With regard to the other point., the hardship on the individual, I will be very glad
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0164"/>
<col>319</col>
to do what I can to meet the noble Marquess. He called attention to the fact that Section 2 of the original Act did give certain advantages to women who had been trained either at the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland or at the Rotunda Hospital in Ireland. If the noble Marquess introduces an Amendment carrying out that, I shall be very glad indeed to consider it favourably and to do what I can to meet the claims of these individuals. But may I point out that that is one of the objects of Clause 12 in this Bill. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Clonbrock, and the noble Marquess will look at that clause. The object of it is to give reciprocal treatment to any women who produces to the Central Midwives Board satisfactory evidence that she has been trained as a midwife and certified in any other part of His Majesty's Dominions. So that one of the objects of the amending Bill is to see that a woman who can produce satisfactory evidence that she has been certified by a public authority qualified to give her the certificate shall come under the Act and receive the advantages of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00808"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Earl think that will cover the individual cases he has mentioned, because I had not noticed that clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00809"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Subsection (1) of this clause reads&#x2014;
<quote>"Any woman who produces to the Central Midwives Board satisfactory evidence that she has been trained as a midwife and certified in any other part of His Majesty's dominions in which there is for the time being in force any Act or ordinance for the certification and registration of midwives under a public authority, and which admits to its register midwives certified under the principal Act on reciprocal terms, shall on payment of the like fee as is payable in ordinary cases be entitled to be certified under the principal Act; provided that the standard of training and examination required in such other part of His Majesty's dominions is equivalent to the standard adopted by the Board."</quote>
I am not prepared to say, without consideration, whether that would apply to the various cases mentioned by the noble Marquess, but if he and his advisers think it will not, I shall be very glad to consider any Amendment, and perhaps in consultation with the noble Marquess, be able to arrive at some agreement before the Committee stage. I can assure the noble Marquess that it was not in our minds to affect adversely any woman from any country so long as she is properly trained.<lb/>
<col>320</col>
Perhaps I might say, in answer to the two points on which Lord Balfour of Burleigh chiefly spoke, that the object of Clause 11 is to meet certain cases which we are afraid may happen in which women not properly qualified may be regularly employed by a doctor, the doctor himself not meaning to be present at the actual moment. Our idea is to prevent such a practice taking place, so that when the doctor makes a habit of not being present then by virtue of these notifications which will reach the central authority they will become aware of its being a practice and take steps in order to prevent it. But I quite agree with the noble Lord that this is a matter for Committee, and I had in mind a possible Amendment submitted to me with regard to which we may come to an agreement at the Committee stage. Then as to the slight criticism by the noble Lord with regard to the small alterations to the original Bill, might I say that if the alterations are small it seems to me not unfair to ask that the time given to the consideration of this Bill may also be small. If I had made alterations enlarging the scope or revolutionising the effect of the Bill, it would have been only fair to have given several weeks to its consideration; but the amendments being, as the noble Lord said, of a somewhat small character, I do not think it unfair to ask your Lordships not to delay too long before taking the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00810"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I draw attention to one remark of the noble Earl? I fully recognise the spirit in which he has met the representations from Ireland and our desire to remove what we think a hardship. As to Section 2 of the original Act, he promises that if we bring forward an Amendment based on the lines of that section with regard to Ireland, lie will consider it very favourably. The noble Earl then referred us to Clause 12 of the Bill under discussion, but I would point out this difficulty. This clause refers to the Colonies more or less. It is meant to be reciprocal. It is given to the Colonies because there is an actual ordinance in force. In Ireland there is no actual "ordinance" in force, but only a good system. Perhaps the noble Earl will consider that before he brings the Bill forward again.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00820">2. Where a tenancy has been terminated before the commencement of this Act, and the tenant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries that he has incurred any loss or expense for which he would have been entitled to compensation under the foregoing section of this Act if the tenancy had terminated after the commencement of this Act, the Board may, out of the small holdings account, pay to the tenant such compensation for such loss or expense as they think just: Provided that no compensation under this section shall be payable if the claim for compensation is not made before the first day of September nineteen hundred and ten.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00821"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member> moved to amend Clause 2 by extending from September 1 next to November 1 the time in which the tenant in such cases might apply for compensation for the use of his land for the purposes of small holdings. The noble Earl said: The Amendment that stands in my name is merely intended to facilitate the carrying out of the objects for which this clause was inserted when the Bill was in Committee in the House of Commons. The object of this clause is self-evident; it is to enable farmers whose tenancies have terminated before the commencement of this Act to avail themselves of the benefit of the Act. But as it stands now, they will have to send in their claims before September 1. This Bill may not receive the Royal Assent for some weeks, and I suggest that September 1 hardly gives sufficient time to tenant farmers, at what your Lordships must remember is the busiest time of the year for them, to send in their claims. I trust, therefore, that the President of the Board of Agriculture will extend the time from September 1 till November 1. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00824"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Earl will give us some further explanation of how this is a question of privilege. It is not a matter of money at all; it is simply a question of the date before which a claim for compensation must be made. The proposal made by the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, is surely a very reasonable one. This Bill will not become an Act much before August, if then, and you give only four weeks for making the claim at the most busy time of the year when the hay-harvest in some cases is proceeding, and in others the preparations for the corn harvest are taking place, and, of course, we know that farmers are not men who are well acquainted with Acts of Parliament or become very speedily acquainted with them. The result is you really leave them only four weeks during which to give their notice. This, of course, was originally an oversight in the Act; it is one of several oversights; and what the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, really proposes to do in some cases is to take away with one hand what he gives with the other. He says he is prepared to give them compensation, but through allowing such a short time within which to make their claim the result is that many people will very likely find themselves debarred; and when persons who really have a right to compensation find themselves debarred because in four weeks they have not put in their claim, the noble Earl may depend upon it that their grievance, which this Bill is intending to remedy, will be renewed and he will have more trouble. I am sure this cannot be a question of privilege; it is only a question of notice. How that can be a question of privilege I cannot understand. I hope the noble Earl will explain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00825"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: All I have to explain to my noble friend is that I am informed, on the best authority, that this is a question of privilege. It is not for me,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0166"/>
<col>323</col>
being a layman, to explain how or why that is. I have only to state that this Amendment is considered on high authority to be a question of privilege. My duty is most respectfully and most humbly to put that before your Lordships. The matter, of course, is entirely in your Lordships' hands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00826"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that my noble friend who moved this Amendment will hardly be likely to accept the statement of the noble Earl as quite a sufficient reason for the proposition that this is a question of privilege. I think I understand the point the noble Earl refers to, although certainly I cannot claim to be any authority upon that subject. I suppose the idea is that if the date before which the claim may be made is extended to November, that would enable a greater charge to be put on the Treasury than would otherwise be the case, and that from that point of view it would be a question of privilege. But the question of privilege has been raised in such a very remarkable way on several occasions of late years that I confess I should be very sorry to think that your Lordships were prepared to accept this view of the noble Earl, for which he gives no authority, as settling the matter.<lb/>
I am anxious to say a word to your Lordships upon the merits of the question. This is a retrospective clause; it is of an exceptional nature, as it allows tenants whose tenancies have been terminated before the commencement of this Act to make a claim under the Act on account of the past termination of their tenancies. I feel very strongly that retrospective legislation of this kind is very often open to grave objection, and I think we ought to limit it as much as possible. How is it limited here? It is limited in this way, that the claim must be sent in by September 1. The noble Earl who proposed this Amendment, I think, had in his mind the view that a farmer who would come under the definition of this clause would never have heard of the clause until the Bill containing it became law. But, my Lords, this question has been mooted in Parliament, and has been known to Chambers of Agriculture all over the country for months past, and I venture to say that every farmer who could possibly be entitled to claim under this clause has known all about it for months. I
<col>324</col>
confess that if the noble Earl opposite opposes this Amendment on its merits, and not as a question of privilege, I should personally be inclined to support him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00827"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess it comes as a matter of surprise to me that His Majesty's Government should oppose this Amendment on the plea of privilege. As the noble Viscount has just said, we have had this plea of privilege brought up on many occasions of late years. Amendments which have been drafted merely to assist the working of an Act have been swept aside on the ground of privilege. I might instance an Amendment which many of your Lordships will recall to mind on the Old Age Pensions Bill. The clause dealing with disqualification for imprisonment was found to admit of possibilities of grave injustice which were never intended by His Majesty's Government. And yet on the plea of privilege our Amendment dealing with this point&#x2014;a non-contentious point&#x2014;was rejected.<lb/>
In these cases Amendments did, to some extent, vary the charge. But this Amendment that I have proposed does not vary the charge at all; it does not alter the number of people who will be able to avail themselves of the benefits of this Bill; it merely gives them a little more time to take advantage of a Bill which I presume the Government intends should benefit them. Even Sir Edward Strachey, who inserted this clause in the Bill when it was in Committee in the other House, said in regard to the limitation of time&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Bill only received the Royal Assent on the 15th August, an alteration of the time at which the provision would come into operation might be made in another place."</quote>
Sir Edward Strachey evidently foresaw that it might be difficult for farmers in the time allotted to them to send in their claims, and anticipated that, if necessary, such grievance would be remedied by an Amendment in this House. Now, my Lords, if this contention of privilege is to apply to Amendments which do not in themselves vary the charge but merely enable the people of this country to avail themselves of the benefits afforded by a Government Bill, then I most emphatically protest against the action of His Majesty's Government. I think it is, as Mr. Speaker
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0167"/>
<col>325</col>
said in the House of Commons in regard to another Amendment, a case of privilege mad, and therefore I must press my Amendment to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00828"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I respectfully ask the noble Earl to consider whether he is not a little ill-advised in refusing this Amendment? This Bill enables any one to make a claim for compensation before September 1. Every one, therefore, who is entitled can come in up to that time. If the Amendment is accepted it simply means that every one who is entitled to come in up to September 1 will be entitled to come in up to November 1. The time will be extended For all those who are entitled to come in. and it cannot mean that one single person more will be brought in. In my opinion, therefore, no rule of privilege can apply. The whole point of the Amendment is that a man who is entitled and who means to claim before September 1 gets a little more time in which to make his claim.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00829"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not the practice or the business of members of the Government in this House to discuss whether the House of Commons will make a claim of privilege in regard to a particular Amendment. We may have our opinions upon the subject. If I am asked my opinion I should say I anticipate&#x2014;whether your Lordships may think it a wise exercise of privilege or not&#x2014;that the claim will be made on the present occasion if the Amendment is passed. I may prove wrong, but, as one knows, it is practically Mr. Speaker, and in the last resort the House, often interpreted by previous notice on the part of persons officially employed in the House of Commons, that is the source through which the claim is made, and there is an interpretation of the claim which is recognised in the House of Commons. I will not say anything more upon that subject beyond this, that I think it is present to the minds of most members of your Lordships' House at the present time that it is undesirable in the public interest that we should have any unpleasant controversy on questions of privilege with regard to financial matters with the House of Commons. To-morrow or next day it may be desirable in the minds of some people, but unless there is a good reason for doing otherwise I should think it would be better on the whole at the moment to
<col>326</col>
leave a matter of this kind so far as we can in suspense. The noble Viscount on the merits, I understood him to say, was disposed to support the Government in opposition to this Amendment. That is the view of members of the Government, and I hope the noble Earl, after such weighty advice as that of the noble Viscount, will not think it necessary to divide on his Amendment merely for the sake of pressing a question which may lead to unnecessary conflict and unpleasantness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00830"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with almost every word that the noble and learned Lord has just said, but I claim him as an advocate against the President of the Board of Agriculture. The noble and learned Lord says he does not think it advisable in this House for us to commence this discussion of privilege, or as to what would be regarded as privilege in another place, I would ask him who commenced this discussion here? Why, Lord Carrington. He not only commenced it, but he did not give us any reason for his opinion; he did not even tell us who had advised him. His legal advisers, he will remember, have not always been right in regard to this Bill. He does not say that it is the opinion of Mr. Speaker. I quite agree it is much better that in this House we should not discuss these matters, but leave them to the House of Commons to settle. Turning from the argument which has been advanced by Lord Carrington to the merits of the question, it has been pointed out by Lord Alverstone that no man can claim under the Amendment who is not by the Bill as it stands entitled to claim. That being so, what can be the objection to saying that a man is to have five, six or eight weeks more within which to make his claim? If the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, may not think it worth while to persevere with his Amendment, I should say, <i>a fortiori,</i> that there is much more reason why the noble Earl in charge of the Bill should not persevere with his objection, which is founded on a point which the Lord Chancellor, in common, I believe, with, all the rest of us, thinks should not be discussed here.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE SUPER-TAX.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00848"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to call attention to the directions required in filling in particulars of income for Super-Tax; and to ask His Majesty's Government on what ground of law and equity they justify these directions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00849">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in putting this Question to my noble friend who represents the Treasury in this House I think the shortest and best course for me to take to bring the matter as clearly as lies in my power before your Lordships is to refer you in the first place to the Income Tax Act of 1842, upon which all subsequent amendments of the Income Tax have been based. Under Section 124 of the Act of 1842 it is provided in the case of any one who makes a claim for exemption from Income Tax that a declaration so made shall be&#x2014;and I wish to call your Lordships' attention to these words&#x2014;
<quote>"in such form as may be provided under the authority of this Act declaring and setting forth therein all the particular sources from whence the income shall arise and the particular amount arising from each source."</quote>
Those are the words in the Act of 1842, and any one who has studied the last Finance Act will be struck by the fact that in a great many cases for the purposes of convenience the Act of 1842 is referred to as the governing principle to be followed. It rather emphasises my point, that being so, that when you come to Section 72 of the Finance Act of 1910, which deals with this question of the form of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0169"/>
<col>329</col>
the return of Super-Tax, these words are inserted&#x2014;
<quote>"Every person upon whom notice is served in manner prescribed by regulations under this section by the Special Commissioners requiring him to make a return of his total income from all sources,"</quote>
and so on. If it had been the intention of Parliament that such a Return should involve the very elaborate and minute directions which have now been issued by the Treasury, nothing would have been easier than to have inserted in the Act a requirement that, instead of a return "of his total income from all sources," he should make a return setting forth all the particular sources from whence his income arose and the particular amount arising from each source.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00850">Speaking, of course, as a layman, it does not seem to me to be the intention of Parliament, having regard to this subsection, that those who make a return for Super-Tax should make any other return than a total return from all sources. In the notice which is sent round in regard to returns for Super-Tax it is specified that particulars of income from trade, property, ownership or occupation of land, bank and other interests, and the wife's income must be given. Now, my Lords, I maintain that if any one honestly makes a return of the totals under those heads he is fulfilling the requirements of the Act of Parliament, and I want to ask my noble friend how, under Section 72, you are going to subject to any penalty a person who makes a return as regards totals but declines to make the very elaborate return required by the Commissioners. Subsection (4) of Section 72 says&#x2014;
<quote>"If any person without reasonable excuse fails to make any return or to give any notice required by this section, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds."</quote>
Of course, a person would have made a return; he would not have failed to make a return.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00851">Then if you turn to subsection (5) you will find that it says that if a person fails to make a return under the section or if the Special Commissioners are not satisfied with the return&#x2014;that is to say, if they consider the return is a dishonest and improper one, and not a return giving a full statement of his income&#x2014;they are to have the power of making an assessment of the Super-Tax according to the best of their judgment. I do not complain now
<col>330</col>
of that power, but what I say is this. I will take it that I or any member of your Lordships' House make a return giving our total income under the different heads. That return, we will suppose, is not accepted by the Somerset House authorities, who say they consider that we have made an insufficient return. What is the course to be gone through? First, the Special Commissioners in that case assess our income at what they consider to be its real amount. We then say that that is not so, and we appeal from the Special Commissioners to the General Commissioners. I presume that the person who is obliged to appeal cannot be liable to a fine before the matter has been settled by the General Commissioners. But what would happen in that case I What I presume would happen&#x2014;and it does not seem to me to be an unfair arrangement&#x2014;would be that the person against whom the charge was made that his return was an insufficient one would be liable to have his books and his accounts examined and searched, exactly the same power as is now possessed under the Income Tax Act of 1842 in the case of persons who are claiming for an exemption of Income Tax. In that case I presume the Commissioners would send down and look into the matter themselves, and I, for one, should not have the slightest objection, if it was considered necessary, to submit to a full investigation of that kind. But that is a totally different thing from obliging everybody every year to make a most elaborate statement of the most minute details regarding each particular item of property, and that is what seems to me most unfair and inequitable. Subsection (8) of Section 72 says that the Commissioners may make regulations for the purpose of carrying the section into effect. But surely that only gives the Commissioners power to make regulations to give effect to the purport and the purpose contained in the section. It does not give them power to make regulations outside the intention of Parliament. Therefore the first contention I wish to submit to your Lordships is that as a matter of law it does not seem to me that the Commissioners have the right, under Section 72 of the Finance Act, to require more than a general statement of the totals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00852">But it is not merely a question of law; it is a question of common sense. I
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0170"/>
<col>331</col>
should like to call your Lordships' attention in a very few words to what a person is asked to do. The direction runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"If any part of the total income arises from the ownership of land, tenements, or hereditaments, state the precise situation of each property."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00853">I should like to know what the Commissioners mean by asking for the precise situation of each property to be stated. Would the number in the street be sufficient? Or what do they mean by the words "the precise situation of each property"? Does it mean that they must be furnished with elaborate maps, or what? Then the direction goes on to say that the name of the occupier must be given. With the very best intentions in the world I really do not see how it is practicable for an owner of property let to weekly tenants to give the names when the occupiers are changing perhaps from week to week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00854">Then, again, take another case of property in towns, especially in large cities, let to a tenant. The tenant sub-lets the house under his lease to a lot of other tenants for chambers. Is it possible in that case for the person who makes the return, the owner of the chambers, to give a precise list of all the people occupying the chambers who are sub-tenants of a tenant of his? The only person he has to deal with is the person who pays him the rent. Let me mention one more point. The direction goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"If a ground rent, mortgage interest, or other annual charge is payable on any of the property, particulars thereof should be stated"</quote>
in a certain form. That seems to me to show a most extraordinary disregard or ignorance of the system under which a great deal of property is held in large cities. I, and I have no doubt many of your Lordships also, happen to be an owner of town property. What happens is this. A builder comes to me as the ground landlord and says, "If you will grant me a lease of eighty years I will erect. a suitable building upon that land." After I have done that, I know nothing whatever as to what the builder does with regard to his financial operations. The constant habit, of course, is for the builder, upon the security of the lease, to borrow a certain sum of money with which he builds his house, and he again creates a charge to another tenant under him, and so on <i>ad infinitum.</i></p>
<col>332</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00855">One of the points which was very strongly urged in the course of the discussion upon the Finance Bill in the House of Commons was that these returns were no longer to be considered confidential. It is obvious that the owner cannot give this statement about the mortgage interests. He knows nothing about what the builder does, and I do not believe the builder would give the figures, because it might interfere to a certain extent with his credit. Those are the main points which I wish to impress upon my noble friend; and as there is considerable doubt among great legal authorities as to the right of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to ask for all these details, I would ask him whether, supposing the Treasury maintains the view that they can insist on these details, they would object to have a case stated for the decision of the High Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00856"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think there is no doubt whatever with regard to the legal position of the Treasury in this matter. They ground their case on Section 72, subsection (2), of the Finance Act of last year, to which the noble Earl has himself referred. I read out the words in this House on a recent occasion in answer to a Question from the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, on this very point. I would ask the noble Earl to look at the end of that subsection, which says that every person shall, whether he is or is not chargeable with the Super-Tax, make such a return in the form and within the time required by the notice. In addition to that, I would refer the noble Earl to Section 164 of the Act of 1842. He quoted the Act, but not the section. I would ask the noble Earl to read that section in conjunction with Section 66, subsection (2), of the Finance Act of last year. I do not think I should be giving much further information to the House by reading those sections, but I am informed that there is no doubt of the legal position of the Treasury in this matter.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl asks on what authority the Treasury would in certain cases impose certain penalties. I am afraid I am unable to give the noble Earl the exact reference in the Act, but I have no doubt that the legal position of the Government in this matter also is perfectly sound. Then there is another point which has not been referred to by the noble Earl to-night, but which has been raised in this House more than once, as to which,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0171"/>
<col>333</col>
as it is not irrelevant to the question, I should like to be allowed to give a little explanation to the House. Exception has been taken by several noble Lords that these particulars are unnecessary on the ground that they are already in the possession of surveyors of taxes in the various localities. If the House will allow me, I would make one or two remarks on this point. Surveyors of taxes are not concerned with, and do not know the ultimate recipients of, ground rents, feu duties, fee-farm rents, royalties, easements, way-leaves, and other matters of that kind. Accordingly it would not be possible for them to give any certificate either in gross or detail which would cover income of this character. Secondly, a surveyor's certificate would not extend to cases of partial ownership, or of a, share in a trust estate; and thirdly, with regard to rents other than those which I have just specified, except in the ease of properties in which the landlord pays direct to the collector the Schedule A assessed upon his tenants, Income Tax is paid in the first instance by the tenant and is ultimately borne by the landlord by way of reduction from the rent. In these cases the statement that surveyors have complete information in a readily available form is not a correct one. As a matter of fact, surveyors of taxes would have to ask for just the same information as the Super-Tax Commissioners have asked for, and their difficulties would be increased by the fact that estates are situated in different parishes and different surveyors of taxes would have to collate the different information with regard to one estate, which would be a very difficult matter.<lb/>
There is one point where a relaxation of the regulations is to be allowed by the Treasury. Where the landlord pays direct to the collectors the Schedule A assessed upon his tenants, the demand note for the Income-Tax would presumably have attached to it lists giving particulars of the properties, and if the landlord was prepared to send up for the retention of the Government these lists for 1908 and 1909, accompanied by the demand note, we would accept them as sufficient evidence with regard to the property specified, whether farm lands or allotments. I think the fact that we have made this concession will show your Lordships that we have endeavoured to meet some of the objections which have been raised in this House by my noble friend Lord Onslow and by Lord Heneage
<col>334</col>
and other noble Lords. I agree that the filling up of the forms asked for by the Super-Tax Commissioners is a rather irksome business, but, as was said by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, the Government were really in this position&#x2014;either they had to ask for very detailed information or for practically no information at all, relying absolutely upon the word of the individual. Of course, there is bound to be, in setting up a new tax of this kind, a certain amount of friction and a certain amount of creaking of the machinery in the first instance, bat it is the desire of the Government to avoid giving any unnecessary trouble to people who have to make this return. There was one point on which, I think, the noble Earl was not quite correct. He anticipated that this very detailed return would have to be made up and furnished year after year. I think that is not so. I cannot make an absolutely definite statement, but it is very unlikely that anything like such a detailed return will be required again from owners of estates or people liable to the Super-Tax. There are other ways in which we have endeavoured to ease the regulations with regard to the information asked for. For instance, the Super-Tax Commissioners, with regard to estates in Scotland, have accepted a copy of the valuation roll and a summary of the totals as sufficient for their purpose with regard to landed estates in Scotland. And in England many people have sent in copies of their rent roll, and that with a summary of the totals, has in many cases been sufficient to give the Super-Tax Commissioners all the information they require.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00857"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: It would facilitate matters if my noble friend could say that it is not necessary to make a detailed statement of each property and each house such as is required in the directions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00858"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I think that is necessary; but the information is furnished in many cases in the rent roll of the particular property. The noble Earl has raised several points of detail and stated several particular cases. I am afraid 1 must ask him either to give me notice of those particular questions, or, what perhaps would be the better way, if they are, as I think he mentioned, cases that affect his own property, to communicate direct with the Super-Tax Commissioners. He will find them always
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0172"/>
<col>335</col>
ready to give any information that may be desired. The noble Earl appears to think that it is an extremely inequitable proceeding on the part of the Government to ask for all these details and this voluminous information. As against that I am in a position to state the opinion of a noble Lord who sits in the same quarter of the House as the noble Earl himself&#x2014;Lord Faber&#x2014;who, as your Lordships may remember, spoke strongly against the Finance Bill of last year, and, if I recollect rightly, against the Super-Tax, but who is of opinion that now the Finance Bill has become law and the Super-Tax part of the machinery of raising revenue, it is not unreasonable for the Government to ask for the details which have been demanded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00859"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps my experience at the Treasury may justify me in detaining your Lordships for a few minutes on this subject. My noble friend raised, in the first place, the question of the legality of the procedure of the Super-Tax Commissioners in calling for such a detailed return as they have called for in the paper that has been sent to various persons whom they suppose to be chargeable with the Super-Tax. He has quoted the words of the Act of 1842, and has shown that they are different from the words of the Act of this year. But I think the noble Lord who has just sat down has fairly answered that by referring to Section 72 of the Act of the present year as empowering the Commissioners to ask for practically whatever particulars they may choose to require. I may add that I do not think they could have condensed their inquiries under fewer heads than the five heads which appear in the return of total income which has to be made. But I think there is still something required with reference to head B of that form&#x2014;namely, the particulars of income from property. According to what has been stated a return of each house, or something like that&#x2014;a very minute return&#x2014;is required to be made; but this evening the noble Lord who has just sat down said that there would be some change made in that respect. If I understood him rightly, he said that where an Income Taxpayer could produce the demand note for the year 1908&#x2013;9, the items on that demand note would be taken as representing the return which he should make, so that no more details would be required from him under such heads.</membercontribution></p>
<col>336</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00860"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: That is only in regard to property assessed under Schedule A.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00861"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCUONT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Quite so. I am thinking of property assessed under Schedule A. But the demand note for 1908&#x2013;9 is dated some time ago, and I suspect that very many Income Tax payers on property under Schedule A have long ago thrown away those demand notes, and have nothing to show except the receipts for the Income Tax which they have paid. I very much wish that His Majesty's Government would take into consideration what I venture to suggest to them now&#x2014;namely, that they should be content not to ask for more details than the separate assessments of the Income Tax for 1908&#x2013;9. Take an ordinary case of the assessment for Income Tax of an ordinary country property. You will find each farm tenant separately assessed. His farm would be separately returned. You will find all the woods in a parish belonging to and occupied by the same owner, although scattered over the parish, assessed under one single head. You will find, again, all the cottages in that parish belonging to the same owner and not occupied with farms assessed under one single assessment. Why cannot the Commissioners be satisfied with those assessments and not require the owners of property of that kind to specify all the details of such property&#x2014;each wood and cottage separately? I make that suggestion because I am quite sure that the details asked for under this head only give useless trouble to the owners of that class of property, and are quite unnecessary for the fair assessment of the tax.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00862"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe the Inland Revenue have made a concession on one point, but on that I do not think the public are quite clear. The paper sent out required a gross return, and I know that in a number of cases people have been a good deal troubled by having to add the Income Tax again to the net income as returned in their pass books after payment of Income Tax. Now I understand that the Inland Revenue, or the Treasury, have made a concession with regard to that point, and a very important one&#x2014;namely, that the Inland Revenue will themselves add the Income Tax on to the net return as put in by the taxpayer. But I am informed that no order has gone out to that effect, and I would press upon
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0173"/>
<col>337</col>
my noble friend whether it would not be a good thing if some order were issued by the Inland Revenue which would make it clear to the taxpayer that he was not obliged to take the extra trouble of adding the Income Tax already paid to the net return defined in his pass book. If such a, concession has been made, I think it is an error on the part, of the Inland Revenue not to make it perfectly clear by some public document that they have made it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00863"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise for the, purpose of making only cine remark. Lord Denman, as I understood him, concluded by saying that Lord Faber was now of opinion that these minute returns which have been asked for by tin; Commissioners are reasonable. I do not know what his authority for making that statement is, but I can tell him this, that only the day before yesterday Lord Faber told me that he had sent in the returns under each of the four or five heads mentioned, and that they had been accepted by the Commissioners, and he had been asked Co send a cheque on that basis for Super-Tax. I do not know whether I have made it clear that I mean the totals under those heads, distinct from the directions. Income from trade, profession, and so on, is one head; then there is income from property, from occupation of land, from bank and other interests, annuities, dividends and wife's income. As the noble Lord quoted Lord Faber, I think I am justified in doing the same, and in telling your Lordships that Lord Faber sent in his return, according to what he said to me, under those five heads, giving the totals in each case, and no particulars.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00864"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: Not giving details?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00866"><member>LORD SEMPILL</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Lord replies further, I should like to state what happened with regard to an estate in Scotland in which I am interested. Quite recently the factor went to the surveyor of taxes and asked for information as to filling up the schedule. The surveyor informed him that he had received private instructions that he was not to give assistance to any person in filling up these schedules. I must confess to your Lordships that I think a matter like this is not private, and cannot be made private; and I wish
<col>338</col>
to ask whether those are the instructions that are given by the Super-Tax Commissioners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00867"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think some little allowance ought in fairness to be made to a very hardly pressed, and, as far as I know about it, overworked office at the present moment; but to the best of my belief the Super-Tax Commissioners are perfectly willing to give information. I do not say they are going to assist every individual to fill up his return, but they are quite willing to give information, and I know in a great many cases they have done so in respect of how the returns are to be filled up. If the noble Lord would like to give me details afterwards as to the particular case he referred to, I will make inquiries about it; but if information was not forthcoming immediately, I think it may be due to the fact that these gentlemen are extremely hard worked at the present time, mid it is very difficult for them to cope with the great mass of work waiting in their office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00868"><member>LORD SEMPILL</member><membercontribution>: I must admit that my own personal communications with the Super-Tax Commissioners have invariably been met with courtesy and prompt attention. The particular case that I referred to had reference to a subordinate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00869"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: Then the noble Viscount opposite seemed to think it was a very simple matter for surveyors of taxes to give information without referring to the Super-Tax Commissioners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00870"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: No, I did not mean that at all. My point was this. I understand that hitherto the practice has been to ask owners of property assessed under Schedule A to give a separate return of every piece of land or every cottage occupied by a different person belonging to them in a parish. My suggestion was this, that the Commissioners should be content with the existing Income Tax assessments, and that no further details should be required than are now given for the purpose of Income Tax under each assessment. I put a case where all the woods in a parish are assessed under one assessment, and all the cottages in the parish under another assessment; and instead of compelling an owner to send in a return of each separate wood, or each separate cottage, the Commissioners should be content with the existing assessments.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CATTLE FOOD.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00874"><member>THE EARL OF HAREWOOD</member> rose to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture "what was the name of the cattle food which was referred to in this House on June 27 as being composed partly of sawdust; and if it is not a fact that the product referred to was not that made entirely from sugar-cane, which is proving of so much service both to the sugar-cane grower and to the British agriculturist."</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00875">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the Question which I ask the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture does require, I think, a few words of explanation. On June 27 last, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh asked the noble Earl opposite a question with regard to the Fertilisers and Food Stuffs Act, as to why a prosecution was not instituted by the Board of Agriculture in reference to a food stuff which was examined by the official analyst of the Devon County Council and found to consist of forty per cent. of sawdust. In his answer the noble Earl stated that the mixture contained molasses obtained from sugar-cane, and that some absorbent material was added whereby a sort of powder was obtained which was sprinkled over the hay or feeding stuff, a departure from the practice of sprinkling with water. The absorbent material, said the noble Earl, was no doubt derived from wood; there was no doubt at all it was sawdust which had undergone some chemical treatment whereby it became to some extent digestible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00876">My Lords, I am not concerned with the composition of this feeding stuff, nor am I particularly curious to know its name. I merely ask the noble Earl this Question because it has been brought to my notice by the West India Committee,
<col>340</col>
of which I am a member, that the answer given on June 27 has considerably damaged the sale of two food stuffs which are imported from the West Indies, and which have proved of considerable benefit to agriculturists in this country, and, I believe, also in Canada. Those two feeding stuffs are, first, Molascuit, and secondly, Colco. Into the composition of Molascuit sawdust does not enter at all. It is manufactured entirely from sugar-cane products, and nothing else, and on looking at the analysis which I have in my hand I find that the quantity of indigestible fibre contained in that feeding stuff is 5&#x00B7;91, and the absorbent used for the purpose of absorbing the molasses and rendering it suitable for exportation for cattle food is entirely the interior fibre of the sugarcane finely screened, the greater part of which is digestible. So that no sawdust enters into the manufacture of Molascuit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00877">Then in the case of Colco, the anaylsis of which I also hold in my hand, the quantity of fibre, which! I presume is the indigestible part of the food, amounts to 12&#x00B7;84; so that it appears that in neither case does sawdust enter into the composition of these foods. The answer which the noble Earl gave on the occasion I have quoted has caused great damage to the sale of these foods, and, as your Lordships know very well, when a portion of the community, especially the agricultural community, get an idea into their heads, it requires a very distinct and public statement to get it out again, and it is with the object of making this as public as it is in my power to make it that I ask the noble Earl this Question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00878"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has referred to the question that was brought up on June 27 last, and perhaps I may in a very few words repeat what I then said. We all know that there are several patented sugar foods for cattle. They are composed, as my noble friend has said, of molasses absorbed into a product called cellulose which is manufactured either from wood or peat fibre. The absorbent to which the noble Earl has called attention is used as a medium merely for absorbing the molasses, and as I am informed is of very little or no feeding value whatever. The appearance of these manufactured foods is, I believe, something like the coarse sugar which is well known to us in shops&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0175"/>
<col>341</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00879"><member>THE EARL OF HAREWOOD</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Earl, but I beg to remind him that the analyses which I have quoted show that neither wood nor peat fibre is a component part of the foods that I have referred to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00880"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl mentioned the word sugar-cane, and I think that those who have been to a good school will remember that cane is wood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00881"><member>THE EARL OF HAREWOOD</member><membercontribution>: It is the interior soft portion of the sugar-cane, not the outside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00882"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: These sugar foods are used in small quantities, not as regular food but as appetisers or relishes. A bullock will eat about a hundredweight of roots and swedes in a day and 15 to 20 lbs. of hay, and as an appetiser 5 to 7 lbs. per diem of these sugar foods. Those figures show, therefore, that these foods are simply used, as I have said, as appetisers or relishes, and not as regular food for cattle. The products in which my noble friend is interested include the refuse, I believe, of the sugar-cane, scientifically treated;
<col>342</col>
the others, as I said before, are prepared from wood or peat. I think the House will agree that it does not fall within my province as President of the Board of Agriculture to make any comparisons or to draw any distinctions in this House between the different forms of patented sugar foods. Still less ought I, I think, to make any statement whatever which might be used either as an advertisement or a disparagement of any particular manufacture. My duty, I conceive, is to see that the provisions of the. Fertilisers and Food Stuffs Act are properly carried out. Therefore I am not prepared to give the name of the cattle food which was referred to in this House on June 27; and as to the value of the cane food which was mentioned in the speech of my noble friend, I do not think, either from the point of view of the manufacturer or the British agriculturist, I ought to be asked to offer any opinion. I therefore very much regret that I am unable to meet the wishes expressed by my noble friend opposite.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LAWLESSNESS IN IRELAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00901"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> rose to call attention to the withdrawal of prosecution against the nine men engaged in violently resisting the law at the evictions at Kilmurry, Castle Island, co. Kerry, in June, 1909, and to ask whether His Majesty's Government are so satisfied with the present state of the county of Kerry as to deem the vindication of the law in this case unnecessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00902">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the circumstances connected with the eviction which forms part of the Notice on the Paper are so peculiar that I hope I may be allowed to state them in some detail. It appears that negotiations for the sale of this farm were entered into as early as the year 1903. The landlord is Mr. Peirce Gun Mahony; the name of the tenant was Mr. Richard Walsh, and the rent of the farm &#x00A3;34 13<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. At that time the tenant signed a paper stating that he was perfectly content with the terms offered, provided certain minor matters with regard to turbary were arranged. A scheme was then drawn up by two parish priests of the neighbourhood, but the tenant refused to accept their decision although he had previously stated he would do so. He then refused to go on with the terms of purchase or to pay any rent whatever. In the year 1905 three years rent was due, and proceedings were taken by the trustees for the rent. Judgment was marked against the tenant, and as he had removed all his hay and stock on the farm, his
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0177"/>
<col>345</col>
interest was put up for auction and purchased by the agent of the property. An offer was then made to him to accept twenty-one and a-half years purchase of the rent, which was a second term rent. This the tenant refused absolutely. He then fell ill, and no further move was taken for some time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00903">But in the year 1907, the tenant having paid no rent in the meantime, the trustees of the property issued a writ of ejectment. He defended these proceedings unsuccessfully, and this caused still further delay. The next step was on November 5, 1908, when an attempt was made at ejectment, which failed owing to the insufficient force brought to protect the sheriff and the determined resistance offered by the tenant and others in the neighbourhood. On November 15 of the same year a large meeting was held under the auspices of the. United Irish League, at which violent speeches were made by Members of Parliament and others, calling upon the people in the neighbourhood to support Richard Walsh in his "sturdy struggle for his home against exacting landlordism." A fund was started called the "Castle Island Eviction Fund," which received large subscriptions, and by the help of the people in the neighbourhood the house was fortified in a most scientific manner. Trees were cut down and laid across the road, trenches were cut round the house, fences of bushes and barbed wire were erected, a subterranean passage was made from the house to the yard, the walls of the house were propped up with timber, and barrels of tar and lime were procured, with syringes and a pump in order that the ingredients might be poured on the attacking party.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00904">Another attempt at ejectment was made on June 4, 1909, which again failed. Finally, early in July of last year a force of 250 police accompanied the eight bailiffs, and in the course of a several hours siege the police, as the right hon. gentleman the Chief Secretary stated in the House of Commons, were subjected to every kind of violence. Hot tar and lime were poured upon them, and the sight of one police officer was seriously imperilled. An entrance was effected after several hours by making a breach in the wall, and the garrison, consisting of fifteen men, were arrested on the spot. They were then brought before the magistrates at Petty Sessions, but though they had been caught red-handed, the magistrates
<col>346</col>
by a majority of one refused information. The then Attorney-General, recognising that there had been a gross miscarriage of justice, directed the prosecution of nine of them at the Spring Sessions last March. Six had in the meantime left the country and gone to America. One would have supposed, seeing the excitement and agitation that prevailed in the district and that the magistrates had refused to convict, that it would have been manifest that nothing better could be expected from a common jury, and one would have thought that the case would have been brought before the Winter Assizes, when the trial would not have been held in the county of Kerry, or else that application would have been made to change the venue. But the matter was brought before a Kerry jury last March, and the jury acquitted the prisoners on the main charge. The learned Judge who tried the case, Lord Chief Justice O'Brien, expressed strong disapproval of the verdict, but added some words of commiseration of the jury in the position in which he saw they were placed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00905">It was then stated, that the prosecution of the defendants on several other charges would be for the present postponed. But we saw from the statement of counsel for the Crown a fortnight ago at the Summer Assizes that these prosecutions had been withdrawn in consequence of the peaceable state of the county. It is only fair to say that the learned Judge who presided, Lord Justice Cherry, had previously spoken of the peaceable state of the county. There had only been a few cases of minor boycotting and threatening letters reported to him by the Constabulary. But even with this apparent outward improvement as regards the diminution of these offences, it is hard to imagine why His Majesty's Government, in the face of the terrorism which they must have known was exerted a few months before, when the jury were afraid to convict in the face of clear evidence, should consider the county to be. in a satisfactory state. They must surely see that if it is quiet, it is because the United League and the party of agitation have got matters so completely into their own hands and have been able to defy the law so successfully that they have exercised a system of terrorism over the country which has enabled them to dispense with any acts of violence. It is hard, therefore, to conceive how this could be considered a satis-

factory state. But, even if it were, I confess I fail to see the connection between the present peaceable state of the country and an outrage which was committed a year ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00906">We sometimes hear comparisons instituted between the state of crime in Ireland and the state of crime in England. It would be no doubt impossible to draw a parallel with regard to this particular outrage, because I do not suppose it has ever happened in England that an ejectment for non-payment of rent has had to be executed by 250 police; but taking any other sort of crime, people would be very much surprised in England if they heard that a prosecution for any criminal offence was withdrawn because for the last few months no similar crime had taken place in the county concerned. Have these prosecutions been abandoned because the Government supposed that their abandonment would be popular in the county, that the majority of the people are in sympathy with the parties who were to be brought up? If that is the case, and if there is a widespread sympathy on the part of the majority of the people in favour of resistance to the law, what becomes of the peaceable state. of the country? Is it to be considered in a. satisfactory state? Or is it the case that the party of agitation have not only established a, thorough system of terrorism over the particular district, but that they have struck terror into His Majesty's Government, and that the Government are afraid that any proceedings taken against these men would create a disturbance? If so, it would appear that they are so anxious to be able to assure the country of the peaceable state of Ireland that they want peace at any price&#x2014;even at the price of allowing offenders against the law to go scot free. It is so curious that I am anxious to know from His Majesty's Government what motive they had in dropping the prosecution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00907"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support my noble friend in his action in putting this Question to His Majesty's Government. I do not wish to go into the details of this case. They are sufficiently known to the officials at Dublin Castle, to the officials at the Irish Office, and to the Chief Secretary; and your Lordships have heard from my noble friend Lord Clonbrock what happened&#x2014;how the jury refused to convict, and how the Lord Chief Justice said that, after all,
<col>348</col>
he pitied these jurymen for there was no doubt they could not convict, because we all know that a very broad hint is given to common juries in that part of Ireland that if they convict their lives will be made unbearable, and perhaps something worse may happen. The details of the case, as I have said, are well known. But some reference to the action of the Chief Secretary and the Law Officers of the Crown is absolutely essential with regard to this matter.<lb/>
I will take what occurred at the Kerry Summer Assizes on July 8 this year. Mr. Lynch, K.C., referring to the case of the King against Richard J. Walsh and others, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The principal indictment was disposed of at the last, Assizes."</quote>
We know how that was disposed of&#x2014;by the jury refusing to find the parties guilty, although they were caught in the act. Mr. Lynch continued&#x2014;
<quote>"There were still some minor charges, but the Attorney-General had directed him, in consequence of the peaceable condition of the county, to enter a <i>nolle prosequi."</i></quote>
The Judge is thereupon reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am very glad. Let it be done."</quote>
With regard to the "minor charges," I should like to ask His Majesty's Government whether they consider tins one of the minor charges. Sergeant John McIntyre, of the Royal Irish Constabulary depot, stated before the magistrates at Castle Island&#x2014;
<quote>"The remains of a bag of dry lime were thrown on him; he became practically stone blind for a time, and his right eye was still very weak. He was medically treated."</quote>
There is one thing which is rather satisfactory with regard to this matter, and that is that since the authorities announced their intention of sending these persons for trial six of these blackguards have left the country. I only wish that the minor charges had been gone on with, because the rest of the blackguards would most likely have left the country also, and we should have had no more of this ruffianism in the district.. I know it is wrong to animadvert on anything that a Judge does, but I should like to refer to the remark of the Judge when the Attorney-General withdrew these cases at the Assizes. The Judge said he was "very glad." I wonder if the respectable citizens and farmers and those who wish to do their business
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0179"/>
<col>349</col>
in quiet in the county of Kerry are very-glad that these people are not to be prosecuted for these offences.<lb/>
With regard to the statement that the county of Kerry is in a perfectly peaceable state, I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to what the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kerry said in his Lenten Pastoral published a few months since. The Bishop drew a very different picture. He referred to "wholesale drunkenness," "violence," deeply criminal conduct, in connection with malicious injury to property, which he denounced as "contemptible, mean and cowardly," "personal violence leading to the loss of human life"&#x2014;these are some of the epithets employed by the Bishop in admonishing his people and trying to reform them. I submit that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kerry knows a great deal more about the doings of his flock than even the officials, the police, or the resident gentlemen and farmers in the county of Kerry. He has the means of knowing exactly what is going on, and no stronger language could have been used than that contained in his Lenten -Pastoral. I wish that those in authority in Ireland and in another place would use that language or language approaching to it.<lb/>
No doubt we shall be told that this is an isolated case, and that the rest of Ireland is in a prosperous condition. But what these people want is to be able to go about their business in a quiet and orderly manner, and to see the ordinary law of the land carried out and malefactors of this kind pursued in the same manner as they pursue their evil practices. I hope the Government will give a direct though I do not know whether it. will be a satisfactory answer to the Question which my noble friend Lord Clonbrock has put to them. We do not bring these cases up for Party purposes, or anything of that sort. It does not matter to those who live in Ireland what Party is in power. We ask that Party to keep the country in order according to the law of the land as it exists. That is what we ask, and I hope that an answer will be given which will at all events allay the doubts which exist in our minds at present.</membercontribution></p>

sat down disclaimed any intention of making Party capital or advantage out of the case which Lord Clonbrock has brought before your Lordships' attention this afternoon. If we start from that basis, I think we shall get on better in this and similar matters than if a Party spirit prevailed. This case is on the general lines stated by the noble Lord, but perhaps you will allow me to recapitulate rapidly exactly what happened. This farm was held by a man named Walsh at a judicial rent of &#x00A3;31. and he had fallen into arrears for rent. In March, 1906, judgment was marked against him for &#x00A3;107 and &#x00A3;10 costs.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00910"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I do not know how far it was retrospective, but that was the judgment given in March, 1906. Walsh thereupon removed his hay and stock from the farm. The sheriff then seized his interest in the farm and put it. up for sale, when the agent purchased it. In July, 1907, a writ of ejectment was issued, and after a good deal of litigation Walsh's eviction was carried out on June 22, 1909. On this date the sheriff's officers, assisted by a protecting police force, arrived at Walsh's house, finding it strongly barricaded as has been described, and on the sub-sheriff demanding possession, hot water, tar, lime, etc., were thrown at him and his officers as well as the police. In endeavouring to effect an entrance the sub-sheriff and his officers were assaulted, and the police, on instructions, forced an entrance. They were also attacked. and two men were rather severely injured., but. I am glad to say that I hear in both cases they are doing well and there is no permanent injury. There were fifteen men inside the house, and they were arrested and brought before the resident magistrate, who remanded them; on July 7, when the case came before the bench of magistrates, it was adjourned to July 16, and further adjourned to August 3, and on that date the magistrates refused information, the resident magistrate dissenting.<lb/>
Upon that the Attorney-General took up the matter, and bills against nine of the defendants were sent up to the Spring Assizes. The charges made against them were three&#x2014;first, resisting the sheriff's officers; secondly, assaulting the police;
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0180"/>
<col>351</col>
and, thirdly, unlawful assembly. As the noble Lord has stated, the jury acquitted the defendants on the first indictment&#x2014;that of resisting the sheriff's officers. I may here say, in parenthesis, that the position of the police in cases of eviction is peculiar. They are not entitled to assist the sheriff in bringing about the eviction. They can only step in if there is a breach of the peace, or likely to be a breach of the peace. I do not know whether it was on that ground that the jury acquitted the prisoners under the first. head. I merely mention it as a technical point which may have availed in regard to this case. The trial on the other indictments was postponed to the next Assizes, and then the Crown counsel, by direction of the Attorney-General, entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i> and the defendants were discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00911"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: What were the charges then outstanding?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00912"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Assaulting the police, and unlawful assembly. With regard to the state of the county, I may say no further disturbance occurred in connection with the eviction, and the county generally remained peaceful throughout the remainder of the year, although there were some cases of serious crime. Your Lordships will remember that an election took place in January of this year as a result of a petition, and although feeling ran very high the police were able to maintain the peace; in April and May there was a slight anti-grazing outbreak in a part of the county, but in June, however, the county inspector reported the county to be generally peaceful.<lb/>
With regard to the statement of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kerry in his Pastoral Letter, I dare say the House would like to have the figures as to the state of lawlessness in that. county at the present time contrasted with last year. There were last year 13 cases of incendiary fires; this year, up to June 30, there were 10. Of cattle maiming there were 7 cases in 1909; for the half-year up to June, 1910, there were 5. These are the chief headings under which compensation for malicious injuries is claimed. As regards the Bishop's reference to crime involving violence or loss of human life, I may mention that in 1909 there were: one case of murder,
<col>352</col>
2 cases of manslaughter, 3 cases of firing at the person, 5 cases of aggravated assault, and 3 cases of maiming. It is satisfactory to know that there has been no case of murder, manslaughter, or firing at the person since January of this year. In 1909 there were 3 cases of firing at the person, and 8 cases of firing into dwellings. There has been no case of firing at the person since January of this year, and there have been 5 cases of firing into dwellings. The number of cases in which police protection is afforded is about the same as in previous years, but there is no case of serious boycotting. Six cases of cattle-driving were reported in 1909; there has been only 1 case since January of this year. It was upon those facts, no doubt, that Lord Justice Cherry felt himself justified in making the speech to the Grand Jury at the Summer Assizes at Tralce, in which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am extremely happy to be able to inform you that there are only three bills to go before you involving three offences, none of which is of a serious character";</quote>
and he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"There is not any crime of a serious character which has not been brought to justice, and I am glad to be able to inform you that the whole county is now in a perfectly peaceable condition."</quote>
With regard to cattle-driving he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I also hear that there is no cattle-driving here";</quote>
and then he made a statement with regard to threatening letters, the figure of which is contained in the schedule presented to Parliament, and I think what he said is worth considering, because very often these threatening letters are of a most bombastic kind, and have very little real intimidatory meaning. He says, for instance&#x2014;
<quote>"There have been twenty cases of threatening letters; but threatening letters not followed up by any hostile action is not a very serious matter; and I am informed that they are entirely disregarded by the recipients, who are not even annoyed with them, so that they may be regarded as of no importance. There is in the Irish character a certain melodramatic temperament, which derives pleasure in writing bloodthirsty letters and making bloodthirsty speeches which do not mean very much."</quote>
I may say that, as Lord Mayo anticipated, the Government regard this as an isolated case. It is a case where many special conditions prevailed, not in any sense connected with a general conspiracy to refuse to pay rent. Several features
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0181"/>
<col>353</col>
occurred of a kind which would be easily understood by noble Lords opposite. For instance, a new owner came into the property, and possibly he may have been a little lacking in tact in dealing with this case. Then there is the familiar figure of an old woman of eighty in the house, and all these things tended to inflame feeling in the district.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00913"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: The landlord never interfered with the old lady at all. It was entirely the action of the son which created all this row. She is still in the house, and is as comfortable as circumstances will permit her to be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00914"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I only mention that to show that there was in this case all the elements which lead to a popular demonstration in favour of the tenant. Anyhow, with regard to this prosecution, as I have said, the first charge failed, and the Attorney-General, using his discretionary powers, decided that it was undesirable, in the interests of the permanent peace of the district, to pursue the defendants with other charges. The discretionary power of the Attorney-General is a very real one. He is obliged to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and it is for him to decide whether, in the general public interest and having regard to the general condition of the country, it is desirable that the Crown should prosecute or not. Even if the Government had been in possession of those greater powers under the Crimes Act, it would have fallen to the Attorney-General to use his discretion in exactly the same way. I also frankly admit, although I cannot speak for the Attorney-General, that he may have had a doubt in his mind as to whether the Crown would have been more successful in securing a conviction on the other two charges than they were on the first.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00916"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I have no doubt the Attorney-General ' considered that, and came to the conclusion that it was not in the interests of permanent peace to pursue this matter any further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00917"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Why?</membercontribution></p>
<col>354</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00918"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Because the general state of the country is satisfactory. The noble Marquess himself admitted, in the recent debate on this subject, that with the exception of four counties&#x2014;Clare, Galway, Longford, and Roscommon&#x2014;the condition of Ireland is on the whole peaceful, and that a considerable improvement has taken place of late years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00919"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Yes; but I was careful to point out that, however satisfactory the condition of affairs might be in other parts of Ireland, it is extremely unpleasant for the unfortunate people in these four counties to be ignored, and to be told that they must not complain of the misery they are undergoing because the rest of Ireland is satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00920"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Speaking last year the noble Marquess gave the House to understand that in his opinion the condition of Ireland was worse than it had. been for thirty or forty years. That Was the impression which the noble Marquess conveyed to the House last year. But in the speech he made the other day he carefully stated, in his opening remarks, that he addressed himself merely to the condition of affairs in the four counties I have named.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00921"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My point is that the people in those counties have the same right to protection as the people in other counties, and ought not to be ignored and told that they must not complain because the rest of Ireland is satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00922"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess will have an opportunity later of making his point. I say that there has been, as is admitted by noble Lords opposite, a great improvement in 'the condition of Ireland generally, and Kerry is one of those counties in which, according to the noble Marquess himself, there has been an improvement. I do not know whether noble Lords opposite are again hinting or suggesting that the Crown ought to be armed with greater powers than are now possessed for dealing with these cases. Of course, this is a bad case. I do not deny that for a minute, and it is very unfortunate that such a case should occur. I am not concerned to argue the inefficacy
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0182"/>
<col>355</col>
of coercive measures, if it is coercion which noble Lords opposite desire. No doubt in a way and for a time you can, by the exercise of the Crimes Act, produce a temporary and superficial state of law and order. You can crush crime, no doubt, by the use of the Crimes Act, but what we say is that that policy is a sterile policy, and a proof of that is to be found in the fact that even in the eyes of its authors and advocates the policy of coercion has been a failure. In proof of that I would refer your Lordships to the speech made in this House by the noble Earl, Lord Dudley. Lord Dudley said&#x2014;
<quote>"Ever since I went to Ireland I have striven, to the best of my humble ability, to do the best I could in the true interests of the country, and I cannot refrain now from dissociating myself from the advocacy of a policy the policy of coercion] which, though, perhaps, temporarily efficacious, to my mind cuts at the root of all true union between England and Ireland, and embitters public opinion in that country to such an extent as to render successful government difficult, if not impossible."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00923"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Lord Dudley stood in the debate alone in that opinion. I followed hint and repudiated many of the things he said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00924"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: It is none the less true that Lord Dudley made that speech, and it is none the less true that he was your Viceroy in Ireland. If any further proof were needed of the failure of coercive measures, it is to be found in the introduction of Mr. Wyndham's Act. The fact of the matter is, the management of Ireland requires tact and patience. We shall no doubt have these cases from time to time. They are very deplorable and no one can defend them. But we do say that we are gaining ground, that the condition of Ireland is better than it was two years ago, and is increasingly on the mend. His Majesty's Government do not in any sense of the word condone anything that has happened in this or in similar cases, nor have they refrained from prosecuting because, as was suggested, it would be an unpopular act in the county. We are pursuing steadfastly the policy of putting into operation, so far as we are able and when not advised to the contrary, those ordinary processes of law which exist, and we believe that if we are allowed to continue that policy for a sufficiently long time the condition of Ireland will be very much better.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00925"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just spoken has gone
Lord Ashby St. Ledgers.
<col>356</col>
very much outside the point that was brought under the notice of the House by my noble friend Lord Clonbrock. My noble friend referred to nothing except the condition of Kerry, and in that connection he largely directed attention to one particular case. The noble Lord who has just spoken has gone far outside that. He even went back to a debate of a couple of years ago, when my noble friend Lord Dudley somewhat surprised many of us by a speech which he made on that occasion. With regard to this case, I think Lord Ashby St. Ledgers failed to give sufficient weight and significance to what was said, with all the weight of his responsible position, by the Roman Catholic Bishop in this part of Ireland. Every one knows the close attention which the Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church give to everything that goes on in their diocese, and the deep interest they take in the happiness, well-being, and correct conduct of those within their religious jurisdiction. Therefore what was said by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kerry and quoted by my noble friend Lord Mayo is entitled to very great weight. The grave words which the Bishop used in his Lenten Pastoral this year were written with a profound knowledge of the whole position, and are consequently entitled to serious attention from your Lordships and every one desirous of understanding the real, unvarnished tale to be told with reference to this matter.<lb/>
An important circumstance is that very few of these people were made amenable for the offences. And of those who were made amenable, how many were convicted and punished? In other words, in how many cases were the crimes allowed to remain unpunished? This is a grave question. It may be that terror has now wrought its inevitable result, and that in many- cases the victim ceases to struggle. I do not disparage statistics, or suggest that the state of Ireland and the state of Kerry may not be reasonably examined by the light which statistics may give; but statistics have to be examined with a knowledge of the whole of the circumstances of the case. What. is the position which the noble Lord who has replied on behalf of the Irish Office has presented with reference to this special case? He has not sought to minimise its importance and gravity, except that the general tone of his remarks was rather, I will not
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0183"/>
<col>357</col>
say, to whitewash it, but to prevent its looking as dark as people thought. And I think be described this as an isolated case. I am not sure that I could give assent to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00926"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I mean that it was not part of a conspiracy not to pay rent. It rested on quite exceptional circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00927"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I will take that as the noble Lord's meaning, but if I were discussing this question in the presence of those who were informed technically on the matter and with all the information before them, I would be disposed to greatly question that description. There was a great deal of co-operation in reference to the matter, and that it was an isolated case is one of the last things I would be disposed to accept. In occurrences of this kind if you find a good deal of local sympathy, no matter how you may describe it, it is a serious element, and there must have been a good deal of sympathy and cooperation among all the neighbours in this matter. What are the "exceptional circumstances"? Is not a man who is owed several years rent entitled to look for it? Is he not entitled, if payment is not forthcoming, to ask for possession of his land? Is he not entitled, if he does not get possession of his land, to take legal process?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00928"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The tenant has been evicted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00929"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, but where are the exceptional circumstances? What is there exceptional in a man who is owed several years rent asking for that rent? And what is there exceptional in a man who cannot get his rent seeking to regain possession of his land and appealing to the law? I think it is to be regretted that a word which gives a false impression should be used in reference to this transaction. To misrepresent a single word that the noble Lord has said would be the last thing I would desire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00930"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I used the word "exceptional" in connection with the decision which the Attorney-General had to take. It was not at all a matter as to whether the man had a right to stay on the land. The circumstances were exceptional, and when the Attorney-
<col>358</col>
General had to make up his mind what to do, he took those circumstances into account.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00931"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord now explains what he meant by exceptional circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00932"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: That is what. I said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00933"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Then I take it that what was taking place in reference to this matter was normal; that it was not improper, not exceptional, and not unbecoming on the part of the landlord to seek to get possession of his land as he could not get payment of his rent. That being so, what is the state of facts? The landlord did not get his rent. He endeavoured to obtain possession of his land, but failed. He tried to execute legal process, but again failed. He then appealed to the Government of the day for aid, and I gather from the discussion that the Government felt it so important to overcome the feeling that was surrounding this case that they sent a large force of police to see that the legal process was executed and the law administered in that part of Ireland. If there is one thing that is needed everywhere, particularly in Ireland, it is to satisfy the people that the law is strong enough to assert itself and to insist on being obeyed. Here the law failed to enforce itself and to be obeyed. The police were repudiated and driven back; and when ultimately possession of the house was obtained the men who had actively and openly resisted the law were found to a substantial number inside. It is to those men and what was their fate that my noble friend has directed attention. Some of them have left the country. I do not regret it. Others were summoned before the magisterial bench, but informations were refused. Then they were presented at the Assizes, but the local jury acquitted them of one of the charges, and the two other charges, since baptised "minor charges"&#x2014;resistance of the police and unlawful assembly&#x2014;have stood over.<lb/>
The result of the proceedings in Court being what it was, it would probably have been wiser if at an earlier stage in the proceedings some effort had been made to change the venue to a calmer atmosphere. The noble Lord has said that the Attorney-General has to consider
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0184"/>
<col>359</col>
many things when he comes to decide, in reference to particular cases, how he will assert and vindicate the law. I have filled that office myself and know that it is one of great responsibility, and I have no doubt whatever that the Attorney-General in dealing with this case applied his mind to it with a desire to do the best he could in the circumstances. But, none the less, it is to be regretted, in face of the grave defiance of the law that had taken place and the painful incidents that occurred in the administration of justice in this case, that at an earlier period some vigorous effort was not made to ensure that the trial would take place in a locality and under conditions where prejudice, violence, and possibly terrorism did not prevail.<lb/>
In reference to this matter I should like the noble Lord or any member of His Majesty's Government who may take part in this discussion to tell me whether anything has been done, or is going to be done, in reference to the carriage of arms in Ireland. I have no doubt that if there was a check on the holding of firearms in Ireland&#x2014;a check unfortunately removed by the action of His Majesty's Government &#x2014;the men who resisted the police and resisted the assertion of the law would have found themselves not in possession of the weapons which enabled them to offer the defiance which they did. I regard this matter as of the highest importance. Since the discussion the other day in this House many people, not men of my own way of thinking in general politics, have spoken to me in reference to this matter, and they say that one of the greatest misfortunes in Ireland at the present time is the ease and facility with which firearms can be -obtained. This ease might have presented a different aspect in some of its particulars if the Peace Preservation Act had been in force, and I venture to think that it is reasonable to press the Government upon this point. There is not a single member of the Government who does not agree with us in reference to this question of the carriage of arms. I do not think the Government were right, judicious, or prudent. in allowing to lapse the Act which placed restraint on the possession of arms; but, having done so, their responsibility to show that some kind of discretion will be exercised in reference to this matter is increased.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00934"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with reference to the last part of the noble and learned Lord's speech, I can assure him that we are not losing sight of this question of the carrying of arms in Ireland, or, indeed, in the United Kingdom generally, and he can rely upon it that we shall endeavour to deal with the subject as a whole. At the same time I am not quite sure what bearing that fact, although I fully admit it is important, has upon the particular case brought forward by the noble Lord, Lord Clonbrock. In this particular case of eviction, when most regrettable and reprehensible violence was used, I am not aware that firearms were even produced. I am, however, certain that they were not used, and therefore I confess I do not quite follow the noble and learned Lord in his observation that had more severe restrictions been placed upon the carrying of firearms this particular incident might have assumed a different character. There was, I am afraid, a great deal of violent assault. with hot water and tar in the course of these proceedings, but I think I am right in saying that there was no exhibition of firearms in the case.<lb/>
I do not complain of noble Lords opposite for having called attention to this case, but the general issue raised by the noble Lord's question is, I think, a simple one. It was somewhat complicated owing to the interruption made by the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, during the remarks by my noble friend behind me. My noble friend Lord Ashby St. Ledgers was, I think, justified in drawing attention to the fact that when four counties were specifically mentioned by the noble Marquess as forming the disturbed part of Ireland, the county of Kerry, in which this incident occurred, was not one of them; and the importance of that fact rests upon this, that the reason, as I understand, which actuated the Attorney-General in taking the course he did in not proceeding with the prosecutions was that the state of the county of Kerry was not unsatisfactory. That, I admit, is a point on which any noble Lord is entitled to hold his own opinion. Whether it is or is not a sufficient reason for not proceeding with the prosecution in a particular case that the general state of the county, particularly in relation to the special offence, that of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0185"/>
<col>361</col>
resistance to eviction, does not give cause for apprehension, is, as I say, a matter on which every one is entitled to his own opinion; but, after all, the Attorney-General has that particular discretion. It is in a sense an act of government, but it is the discretion of the Attorney-General, taking into account, as the noble and learned Lord has stated, all the circumstances of the case; and my learned friend the Attorney-General, reviewing the whole of the circumstances, did undoubtedly decide, in view of the general state of the county, and I conclude also bearing in mind the special circumstances of the case, that it was not expedient, in the interests of justice or of the public peace, to proceed with these particular prosecutions. We cannot, I think, take it further than this. The Attorney-General acted on his own discretion, and if noble Lords opposite consider that he acted imprudently I am afraid they must retain that. opinion. But the discretion exists, and I confess that, speaking for myself and with recollections of Irish administration, I agree that there are cases in which it may be more expedient not to proceed with a particular prosecution in view of the general circumstances of a particular locality.<lb/>
There is only one other point to which I desire to allude. Lord Justice Cherry's charge to the Grand Jury and his expression of satisfaction at the result of the case have been the subject of souse animadversion, to some extent in this House, but also outside. As regards the learned Judge's statement as to the state of the county, that was obviously founded on the police reports, and upon them alone; and, in view of what was said by the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down, it is important to note that it was not merely the fact that there were but few cases before the Court which caused the learned Judge to express that satisfaction&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00936"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I know the noble and learned Loll did not, but what the noble and learned Lord did say was that the mere absence of criminal cases might not be a true index of the condition of a county, because a county might be so terrorised that there is no crime. But in
<col>362</col>
reading the charge of the learned Judge I gather that the police had informed him&#x2014;and, after all, a Judge speaks on police information&#x2014;that there was not any quantity of undetected or unprosecuted crime, and that there was not any serious boycotting. If that is so, if there was neither crime nor boycotting, I think it is difficult to assume that a state of terrorism exists. Terrorism may be carried on in one of two ways. It may be carried on, as it has been at different times in some parts of Ireland, by threats to commit crime, by firing into dwellings, and so on, or it may be carried on by boycotting; but in the absence of those two symptoms it seems to me difficult to assume that a state of anything like terrorism exists.<lb/>
But the point to which I wished to draw attention was that the learned Judge expressed his satisfaction, as was stated by Lord Clonbrock or by Lord Mayo, at the result of the ease. What I understand the learned Judge to have done was to have expressed his satisfaction that the state of the county was such that the Attorney-General felt justified in not proceeding with the case, which is altogether a different thing from expressing satisfaction at the result of the case. I think it is important to draw that distinction, because although we are not in the habit of discussing, I am glad to think, in this House the conduct of learned Judges on the Bench, yet this is a case in which I know animadversions have been made adverse to the particular learned Judge. I have nothing further to add, because my noble friend behind me dealt so very clearly and fully with all the details of the case itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00937"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who speaks for the Irish Office let fall one observation which I think sums up very aptly the whole of the somewhat unedifying story to which we have been listening. He said this was a bad case. So it is; and if the noble Earl who leads the House will forgive me, I am not sure that the statement to which we have just listened makes it a much better case. I am still puzzled as to the reasons which induced His Majesty's Government to abandon these prosecutions. We are, of course, all aware that there have been periods in the recent history of Ireland when His Majesty's Government have found it necessary, and have pro-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0186"/>
<col>363</col>
claimed that they thought it necessary, to deal leniently with persons who had broken the law. I do not suggest that they have condoned lawlessness. But take, for example, the case of the restoration of the evicted tenants to their holdings, many of whom, as we all know, were deeply implicated in lawless proceedings. They regarded these people as sufferers in a great agrarian conflict, and they desired that bygones should be bygones. That was the proclaimed policy of His Majesty's Government. More recently they have given the benefit of extenuating circumstances to persons implicated in the offence of cattle-driving. That was in a way justified by His Majesty's Government upon the ground that these people not unnaturally cast hungry eyes upon the great cattle ranches which joined their holdings; and I think we were once told from the Bench opposite that it was really we who were to blame because of the immense advantages which we have conferred upon the occupiers of land in many parts of Ireland by giving them the opportunity of purchasing their holdings, and that we had thus created the land hunger which the cattle-drives were to satisfy.<lb/>
But in this case where are the extenuating circumstances? What is the pretext for taking a lenient view of the occurrences we have been discussing? It seems to me, in the first place, that the initial offence committed by the people who defended "Walsh's Fort"&#x2014;I think that is what it was called&#x2014;was absolutely unpardonable and unjustifiable. The tenant held his farm under a judicial rent which had been twice reduced. It was a rent considerably below the Poor-law valuation, and that is notoriously a low rent in that part of Ireland. The tenant had, moreover, an opportunity of acquiring the fee of his farm upon terms of the most tempting and advantageous character. Some of my noble friends will, perhaps, correct me, but I will venture to say that in all probability this man before he went into the Land Court had been paying a rent somewhere in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;40, and that he had an opportunity of buying his farm upon terms which would have left him the payer of an annuity of &#x00A3;20. That was a. golden chance for any occupier of land, and the terms were notoriously good because they were accepted by the other tenants on the estate. In the case of this particular man there was a breakdown owing to some hitch with regard to turbary.
<col>364</col>
We know how extremely important this question of the supply of fuel is to Irish tenants, and nobody would think worse of a man for declining to proceed with a purchase arrangement because he found that satisfactory terms were not forthcoming with regard to the supply of turf. But that is not what he did. He said he would neither buy nor pay rent, and he remained for several years without paying any rent.<lb/>
What followed? The farm was fortified, and the people of the neighbourhood were incited, I am sorry to say. by Members of Parliament and others who visited the county, to resist the operation of the law, with the result that there were no less than three successive attacks on this place before it finally succumbed to the police. There was an assault in which sixty police were involved, a. second in which 170 were employed, and finally a third in which no fewer than 250 police were engaged. The noble Earl pointed out just now that no firearms were employed. That is quite true, but it is, I believe, in evidence that boiling tar, quicklime, scalding water, and I think I heard something about vitriol&#x2014;I am not quite sure&#x2014;were employed by the defenders. The resistance, to use the Chief Secretary's language, was so fierce that the Chief Secretary thought it desirable to pay a high compliment to the police force that was employed. The place was finally carried, and I see that when the trustees of the estate put in a claim for compensation, Judge Shaw, a learned Judge no doubt well known to many of your Lordships, described the whole occurrence as a shocking outrage. I must not forget to mention that among the persons caught red-handed in the so-called fort was one person who had been concerned in the second of the three assaults, and who had been bound over to keep the peace, but nevertheless was found engaged in these hostile operations.<lb/>
Then, after that, we get a most instructive glimpse of the criminal law as it works in Ireland. First there were the proceedings before the magistrates. The evidence was amply sufficient. I believe it satisfied the stipendiary magistrate who was present. But the two other magistrates refused informations. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has lately been paying attention to the circumstances under which
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0187"/>
<col>365</col>
Justices of the Peace are appointed in this country, and I would suggest to His Majesty's Government that it might. be useful if some inquiry were to be made as to the conduct. and appointment of some of these Irish magistrates. In spite of this miscarriage before the magistrates, the men were put on trial and the trial took place at Tralee, in a county which, in spite of all that has been said, was, at any rate a very few months before, considered to be&#x2014;parts of it., at all events&#x2014;in a not very peaceful condition. So much was this the case that Lord Justice O'Brien went out of his way to say that he sympathised with the jurors&#x2014;that is, the jurors who had acquitted the persons charged&#x2014;on account of "the state of society." Now what does that mean? It means that the state of society, in that particular neighbourhood at. any rate, was such that the jurors had to choose between, in plain words, forswearing themselves, or taking the consequences of the honest discharge of their duties and facing the persecution to which that honest discharge of their duties would certainly have exposed them. After that abortive proceeding the accused men were to be tried a second time, and on that occasion, as your Lordships have been told, the Attorney-General entered a <i>nolle prosegui</i> on behalf of the Crown, and he did so on account of the condition of the county.<lb/>
I do not want to enlarge on the condition of the county. I am quite certain it has undergone considerable improvement. I am quite certain that there are many parts of it wholly free from lawlessness and crime. But it is, perhaps, asking a good deal to ask us to accept the view that the condition of the county is wholly satisfactory when we remember the emphatic words used this year in his Lenten charge by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kerry. Let me remind the House of the words which the Bishop used. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Another subject which claims our attention is malicious injury to property. We must candidly state that recently we were shocked to see the large number of these criminal cases which came up for hearing before some of our Courts.&#x2026; Recent happenings oblige us to censure very severely the tendency still existing in some places to settle agrarian disputes by recourse to violent and lawless methods."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00938"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think he also spoke in two places of the improvement of the county.</membercontribution></p>
<col>366</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00939"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Earl will not misunderstand me. I admit the improvement. That is conceded. Then there is the remarkable statement made by Lord Justice O'Brien in regard to the jurors which I quoted a moment ago, and which also seems to me to show that one must take <i>cum grano</i> the assertion that the condition of the country is quite so satisfactory as we are asked to believe. What I venture to put to the House is this. Let us assume that the condition of the county has not only improved, but that it is as satisfactory as we are told. Is that a sufficient reason for not allowing the law to take its course in a case of this kind? I fail altogether to follow the train of thought which leads to that conclusion. I say nothing of the question of moral right or wrong in this matter. Let us put it merely upon the bare ground of expediency. The noble Lord who spoke for the Irish Office told us that it was necessary to deal, I think he said, with tact arid patience with these matters. 1 do not see that any tact or any patience is exhibited in the abandonment of this prosecution. What reason can there be for letting off men who break the law, because their neighbours have not broken it? It seems to me so illogical that I cannot understand the reasons -which have influenced His Majesty's Government. Whom are they going to propitiate by this clemency and forbearance? Not the law-breakers. I do not believe for one moment that persons who are disposed to be lawless in that or in any part of Ireland are going to become less lawless because you deal with these matters with kid gloves on. Then what about the effect upon the law-a biding part of the population, the people who have stood aside and kept clear of all these conspiracies? What will be the effect upon their minds of seeing that His Majesty's Government are so easily deterred from following up a really atrocious case such as the one we are discussing this evening? I am afraid that what has happened in this case will further inculcate a lesson which we have been too apt to inculcate upon the people of Ireland during the last few years&#x2014;I mean that in all these cases the scale inclines in favour of those who break the law and against those who have the courage to abide by the law and to vindicate it.<lb/>
There is one other point. What will be the effect of this action upon the police,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0188"/>
<col>367</col>
who were complimented upon the courage with which they faced the defences of this so-called fort? Could anything be more discouraging to them than to see the whole of the arduous work which they had done rendered abortive by this miscarriage of justice in the last stage? Then, my Lords, are we quite sure that an occurrence of this kind does not place rather a slight upon the Courts of law and the learned Judges who have had these matters before them, and who at the last moment see that no further attempt is to be made to vindicate the law and to uphold what they have done? Finally, is it not worth while to consider what effect a scandal of this kind&#x2014;for I can only call it a scandal &#x2014;must have upon the progress of land purchase in Ireland? Land purchase, as has been readily admitted on both sides of the House, has proved the panacea for most of this discontent and lawlessness. Here you have a case where a land purchase transaction was going forward quite smoothly and satisfactorily, but one reckless, malcontent, cantankerous man is allowed to disturb the whole peace of the locality and to upset by his conduct all the good that is being done by the transfer of their farms to the tenants. It seems to me that this affair has been discreditable from beginning to finish, and I do not think that in the course of the debate anything has been said to diminish the grave misgivings with which we regard the conduct of the whole business.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ALDERMEN IN MUNICIPAL BOROUGHS<lb/> BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00940" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00941">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00942"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, perhaps your Lordships will allow me to state briefly what it enacts. The Bill was introduced in another place on behalf of the Local Government Board, and it has passed that House without any amendment at all. Its object is to assimilate in two very small particulars the procedure in municipal boroughs to the kind of procedure now in vogue in the case of county councils and metropolitan borough councils. The councils of municipal boroughs, as your Lordships well know, consist of a mayor, aldermen and councillors; the number of aldermen being one&#x2014;
<col>368</col>
third of the number of councillors; the aldermen hold office for six years, one half of their number retiring every three years, when their places are filled again by election. At these triennial elections of aldermen in municipal boroughs the aldermen, other than the outgoing aldermen, have been allowed up to now to vote; but in the case of county councils and metropolitan borough councils the sitting aldermen have not been allowed to vote in the election of new aldermen, the object being to secure that the aldermen should be chosen only by the elected representatives &#x2014;namely, by the new councillors. This Bill extends this principle to municipal boroughs.<lb/>
The second portion of the Bill is as regards outgoing aldermen. It provides that an outgoing alderman shall not, as alderman, vote in the election of mayor. As your Lordships are well aware, as soon as a new council comes together the first duty is to elect a mayor, who presides over the deliberations of the councillors during the corning year, and it seems only reasonable that the outgoing aldermen, who will not, unless they are re-elected, form part of the council, should not vote in this election. As I have already said, this is the rule which prevails in the case of county councils and the metropolitan borough councils, and it seems only right to extend it to municipal councils. The second subsection of Clause 1 merely makes the necessary amendment to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, to carry into effect the object of the Bill. In other words, this Bill is simply an amending Bill to the Municipal Corporations Act of 1882.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00944"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to oppose the passage of this Bill, the objects of which, indeed, I entirely approve, but to suggest to your Lordships the expediency of making certain additions to it in Committee which will make it even more useful than it is as presented to your Lordships now. Let me, in the first place, call attention to the fact that we. are put in rather an inconvenient position in respect of this Bill, because, although it was brought up here some time since, it has not been circulated, and it was not until this after-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0189"/>
<col>369</col>
noon when I came down to the House that I was able to procure a copy. I do not know where the delay has arisen, but I think that as it his occurred we ought not to suffer for what has happened.<lb/>
The object of the Bill, as the noble Earl has said, is to extend to the election of aldermen of municipal councils the rule which now applies to the election of aldermen on county councils and the metropolitan borough councils. As your Lordships will remember, the introduction of aldermen on county councils and municipal councils was long resented by the advocates of pure democracy as an inroad on the principle of confining the composition of these councils entirely to those elected by the people. But we have had less and less objection of late years to this principle, and it now seems coming to be well admitted that, owing to the defects in representation as we have it at present, it is necessary that elected councillors should be supplemented by co-opted persons if you desire to obtain a body which shall be competent on all sides to undertake the affairs of the community, whether from the point of view of knowledge or experience or even of judgment and practical action. So that now the question is how we can best secure these aldermen, how we can bring into the composition of municipal councils aldermen who shall satisfy the conditions to which I have referred.<lb/>
Formerly, under the Municipal Corporations Act, on all these councils aldermen were admitted to equal rights with the elected councillors, and therefore had a share in the election of the aldermen and were not distinguishable in their powers from other members of the corporation. That gave rise to much criticism, and the unfairness of the operation in the election of aldermen was long made the subject of complaint. There used to be in the other House a Bill annually brought in providing for the election of aldermen by a different method so that they should represent as nearly as possible the different elements in the composition of the original council. It did not, however, pass, but when Mr. Ritchie brought in his County Councils Bill he conceded the objection to the system which then prevailed by providing that in the election of aldermen to county councils the aldermen themselves should have no voice in the election, but
<col>370</col>
that the election should be entirely confined to the elected councillors. But he did not provide that the elected councillors should themselves elect the aldermen by methods which would secure a fair apportionment of aldermen among the different parties represented by the elected councillors, and he may not have done that for many reasons. Up till quite recently in the election of aldermen on the London County Council care was taken to apportion the aldermen among the two main parties on the council so that they should represent a fair proportion of the original elected elements, not disturbing the balance but bringing into the composition of the council elements corresponding to the original elements in the council. I am sorry to say that that method, so honourably initiated and pursued in the London County Council, has recently been flagrantly abandoned, and the election of aldermen has been employed, not for the purpose of adding to the council elements of experience and judgment and weight from persons belonging to both parties, but simply employed in order to add to the voting power of the majority; and I desire that your Lordships may seize this opportunity by means of this Bill to add to the proposal of His Majesty's Government, which provides that in the election of aldermen on municipal councils only councillors should take part and that the aldermen themselves should not vote&#x2014;to add to that a provision that the councillors themselves shall elect according to a method which shall secure an addition to the council of aldermen representing the different elements in the original composition of the council; in other words, that the aldermen should remain as valuable an addition to the council as it is possible to secure.<lb/>
It has been said by the noble Earl that this Bill passed through the other House without amendment, and it may be asked whether it is prudent to raise this question here. The conduct of a Bill through Parliament has become, owing to various circumstances, largely a series of man&#x0153;uvres. You introduce your Bill and construct it so as to prevent as far as possible any discussion or any amendment, and this Bill was brought into the other House in a manner which effectually prevented the mooting of the question I am submitting to your Lordships. The Motion was made to bring in a Bill to deal with the election of aldermen
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0190"/>
<col>371</col>
by alderman, and inasmuch as the Resolution admitting the Bill governs the subsequent dealing with it, it was impossible to introduce into the Bill the Amendments which I now suggest to your Lordships it would be advisable to bring into it. Here we are free to deal with the matter as we may think desirable in the public interest, and it will be in the power of your Lordships, if you are so disposed, to secure that the councilors engaged in the election of aldermen shall vote in such a fashion that the aldermen they elect shall correspond to the divisions of opinion among the councilors themselves. Amendment can be made to the Bill to secure that result, and it would be competent for your Lordships to alter the title of the Bill so as to cover the additions you make to it; and I have reason to believe that they were totally unable to make owing to the very ingenious way the Local Government Board presented the Bill to their notice.<lb/>
As I have said, this Bill was brought in without your Lordships having had an opportunity of seeing it, and it will be obvious that the Amendments which I have hinted at, and which I propose to put on the Table, require some little care and attention in their construction. I think, therefore, I may appeal with confidence to the noble Earl in charge of the Bill to allow the Committee stage to be postponed for a sufficient time to enable your Lordships not only to become acquainted with the scheme of the Bill as it stands but to consider the Amendments which will be put down to it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-00994">Order of the Day for the Third Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00995">Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014; <i>(Earl Carrington.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-00996"><member>Loan BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before your Lordships lose control of this Bill altogether, 1 should like, with your Lordships' permission, to make a short reference to what occurred during the passage of the Bill through Committee while was occupying the Chair. An Amendment was moved, and upon that Amendment privilege was pleaded as a bar to this House entertaining the Amendment. In the first instance, I should like, quite briefly, to recall the facts. The Amendment proposed was in the second clause, and was the substitution of the one word "November" for the word "September," thereby increasing by two months the length of time given to applicants or claimants for compensation in which to prefer their claims. There are, of course, questions on the merits as to whether that extension of time should be given. Into that aspect of the matter I do not propose to enter, or upon it to say a single word.<lb/>
But the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, who is in charge of
<col>378</col>
the Bill, met this proposal to increase the time by two months, not by any argument on the merits, but by a simple statement that it would be a breach of privilege. I venture to say that that placed the Committee in rather a difficult position, because if this House accepts, even upon the word of a. Cabinet Minister, that a certain Amendment is a breach of privilege, the House or the Committee may thereby be afterwards committed to the abandonment of its privilege without knowing what it is doing. That does not seem to me a safe position for this House to take. I am perfectly certain that if any member of the Government or any member of this House thinks that a course proposed by a noble Lord is a breach of privilege, he is not only within his duty but is almost bound to point out to the House his opinion. But it is not only reasonable and courteous, but absolutely necessary, that the grounds on which the statement that a particular proposal is a breach of privilege is made should be put before the House; for this reason, that each House is the guardian of its own privileges. Supposing we make an Amendment in a Bill here and it goes down to another place and the authority there says that that particular Amendment is a breach of privilege, that is conclusive so far as the other House of Parliament is concerned. We may accept it or not, or record our opinion. But it is impossible for us to express any intelligent opinion as to whether an Amendment is or is not a breach of privilege until we know the reasons upon which that statement is founded.<lb/>
It is difficult for me, I am bound to say, to see how this Amendment can possibly be regarded as a breach of privilege. I listened to the arguments while I was in the Chair; and the point which seems to me to be conclusive against its being a breach of privilege is this, that the Amendment does not give one single individual who had not a right to make a claim under the Bill as it formerly stood any right to make a claim. It cannot, therefore, be said with any justice that it places any extra charge on the Exchequer. If a man fails to make a claim by September 1, as the Bill stood he loses his right; but the extension of the time does not give to a single individual who had no right up to September 1 any right to make a claim up to November 1. I think the argument of the Lord Chief Justice on that was conclusive. The request which I want to make to those in authority here or else-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0194"/>
<col>379</col>
where is this. If, as seems to be foreshadowed, a claim is made elsewhere that this is a breach of privilege, I hope that when that comes up it will be accompanied by a distinct and concrete statement as to wherein consists the breach of privilege of which this House is supposed to be guilty.</membercontribution></p>

I submit very respectfully that it is not my duty in any way to raise a question of privilege; still less is it my duty to state grounds upon which such a question may be raised in another place. I believe that the question is absolutely certain to be raised in the House of Commons in this instance. I may be wrong, but I did think that I would be wanting in courtesy to your Lordships had I not stated my belief when the Amendment was moved by Lord Dunmore.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TERRITORIAL FORCE AMBULANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01009"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> rose to call attention to the recent scheme issued by the Order of St. John of Jerusalem as lately published, and to ask what scheme is now proposed by the War Office for the efficient nursing of the Territorial Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01010">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I know that your Lordships are anxious, as all connected with County Associations are, that the scheme for the nursing of the Territorial Force should be on a sound footing, and as, unfortunately, some doubt and misunderstanding have arisen concerning the subject, I venture to call attention to it to-day. Last year a scheme was propounded for the thorough nursing of the Territorial Force. That was left to the Territorial Associations, and the general principle was that., whatever body found the organisation and enrolled the detachments, the whole question of examination and the granting of certificates was to be in the hands of the St. John Ambulance Association. The result was that the St. John Association formed a special branch for Territorial ambulance. A great work has been done
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0195"/>
<col>381</col>
by this Association ineducating people in the giving of first aid, and the fact that there are over 300 centres in England alone working for this purpose shows how keenly the St. John Ambulance Association have taken up the work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01011">Unfortunately, some disputes have arisen, into which I do not propose to enter, which have produced. a certain uncertainty which is seriously handicapping the work of the Territorial Associations. One case has come to my knowledge in which members of the St. John Brigades have felt themselves compelled to leave the detachments already formed. I cannot help feeling that this must be entirely owing to some misunderstanding, which no doubt will shortly be put right. But I quote it to show that this, among other things, is very discouraging to the Territorial organisation throughout time country. But the question I specially wish to bring before the attention of the War Office to-day is that of certificates of efficiency. I hope it is not the intention of the War Office in any way to lower the efficiency standard. There is one large county detachment which I know intimately, the members of which all possess the certificates of the St. John Association, and those people, while proud of belonging to the Territorial Force, are equally proud of their St. John certificates, and they would be very averse to any persons joining that detachment who did not possess a certificate of equal value and of an equally high standard. It has been suggested in some cases that lectures might be given by nurses to women candidates for certificates; but I hope that, if a limited number of such lectures are so given, the remaining lectures of a course will be delivered and the examinations for final certificates conducted by medical men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01012">I have seen it stated in the Press that the War Office at one time contemplated that nurses might not only give lectures but also give certificates. That would be bringing the whole thing to such a farce that I cannot believe it was ever seriously contemplated by the War Office. A really qualified nurse might, perhaps, give women one or two lectures out of a course, but, as I have said, the remainder should be given by qualified medical men. One point on which I hope to get a satisfactory answer is that the War Office will insist on the certificate being given by an independent medical man. On the question of medical
<col>382</col>
men there is one other point I should like to bring to the notice of the War Office. A large number of patriotic medical men have given their services gratuitously in the teaching of classes in their districts, but I understand that the Medical Association is endeavouring to put pressure on medical men to charge certain fees for these classes. I hope that will not be carried to any great extent, because if the Medical Association insisted on medical men demanding large fees for their lectures, it would render the classes practically prohibitive. I hope the War Office will take that matter into consideration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01013">This whole subject will come before the Territorial Associations at their meetings shortly, and it would be a great advantage if we could he assured with regard to the standard of the certificates. These voluntary aid detachments were only begun last autumn; great progress has been made, and I am sure, if it is clearly understood throughout the country that the whole system of nursing for the Territorial Force in time of war is really meant seriously, that during the coming winter numerous classes will be formed all over the country, and that by this time next year we shall have a thorough organisation. But if we are to have this scheme complete in time of war the whole of the arrangements must be made in time of peace. If, unfortunately, the standard is lowered, the scheme will fail from want of support, and deservedly so. I hope the noble Lord the Under-Secretary will be able to give a satisfactory answer on the points I have put before him, and an answer which will remove the doubts which at present exist.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01014"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure I can echo what fell from the noble Viscount with regard to the very valuable work that has been done by the St. John Ambulance Association. We know that they did form what I believe they called a Territorial branch to meet the great calls that were being made upon them in connection with the Territorial Force, the holding of their certificate being ft necessary preliminary to any man or woman becoming a member of a voluntary aid detachment. They have done valuable work in that way, and thanks to what they have done the Red Cross Society has been enabled by much hard work to organise a considerable number
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0196"/>
<col>383</col>
of voluntary aid detachments. I need not go more than the noble Viscount did into certain differences of opinion that arose; but one good thing certainly has come out of this&#x2014;that is that we have recently formed an advisory council which sits at the War Office and has upon it representatives of both the Red Cross Society and County Associations. Recommendations made by that advisory council have recently been submitted to the Army Council, but we have not yet come to any actual decision upon them. I can assure the noble Viscount, however, that we have no intention whatever of lowering the standard of efficiency of persons entering the voluntary aid detachments of the Territorial Force.<lb/>
In the first place, it is a necessary preliminary before anybody can go into a voluntary aid detachment that he or she should hold a certificate. I would qualify my statement that everybody who goes into these detachments is required to hold a certificate, by saying that we propose to make one or two exceptions for the benefit of specialists, such as people who have already been in the Regular, the Special Reserve, or the Territorial Army Medical Corps&#x2014;pharmacists and people of that kind; but everyone who joins for general duty will be required to possess a certificate. With regard to the nature of the certificate, there is no doubt that, though good work has been clone by the St. John Ambulance Association, there is a great demand that the granting of certificates should be facilitated. In a number of places there has been a. general desire to raise voluntary aid detachments, but for one reason or another the people who had intended to join have not been able to get the first aid certificate. We are, therefore, considering the acceptance of certificates other than that of the St. John Ambulance Association. The nature of those certificates we have not yet settled, but we do not intend that the certificate should be any lower than that of the well-known standard maintained by the St. John Association.<lb/>
As to whether classes should be trained by nurses or medical men, the noble Viscount has there touched upon what is undoubtedly a very vexed question. There are a large number of people who consider that nursing should be taught by qualified medical practitioners, and there is another
<col>384</col>
large section who hold the opinion that the best persons to teach nursing are nurses. We have to reconcile those warring factions and arrive at a conclusion which, while enlisting both parties in our support, will not in any way let down the standard. This matter is being considered at the present moment by the advisory council. We are issuing one letter to County Associations on the question, and we shall be issuing more. We are also issuing a letter to General Officers commanding setting out, and asking them to communicate to the County Associations, the attitude we propose to take up with regard to these detachments. We regard the County Association as the authority which should recognise the voluntary aid detachments, and we do not propose ourselves to recognise any voluntary aid detachments which are not recognised by the County Associations. To such voluntary aid detachments as are recognised by the County Associations we shall, of course, afford formal recognition; and we propose to publish from time to time in Army Orders the lists of recognised voluntary aid detachments forwarded to us by the County Associations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01015"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT KNUTSFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a former director of the ambulance department of the Order of St. John and a member of the British Red Cross Society, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words on this occasion, especially as I desire to clear up one or two points that have arisen and which I have seen noticed in the newspapers. In the first place, I am glad that the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War has been good enough to recognise, and with great courtesy, the work that the ambulance department of the Order of St. John has done under the original arrangement of 1909. A territorial branch of the ambulance department was at once formed, and at considerable labour and expense a staff and county sections were started in most of the counties to facilitate persons coming up for instruction and receiving certificates. Then difficulties arose. I do not, however, desire to accentuate them, or to dwell upon them.<lb/>
I will deal first with the point raised by the noble Viscount, which is one of great importance, and upon which there has been considerable misapprehension. The ambulance department have granted certificates
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0197"/>
<col>385</col>
during the last year to something like 30,000 men and women, every one of whom is free to join the voluntary aid detachments. It has been said that there has been a brigade order of the ambulance department of the Order of St. john which prevented members of the brigade from joining voluntary aid detachments, but I am informed that there is no such order. In one county&#x2014;Devonshire&#x2014;a letter was shown stating that was the case that since the department had separated from the agreement with the War Office members of the brigade would not be allowed to join voluntary aid detachments. That was a pure mistake, and it arose in the office during t he absence of Sir Richard Temple, the assistant director of the. St. John Ambulance Association, whose work has been most excellent and consistent throughout in helping forward these great objects. Directly the matter came to his notice Sir Richard made a speech at Gosport in which he stated distinctly the position of the ambulance department. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Join voluntary aid detachments if you wish, or join the St. John Ambulance companies if you wish. It is nothing to the St. John Ambulance Association which you join, as long as you do join one or the other and learn first-aid and nursing. Choose in your own neighbourhood the One which best suits you."</quote>
To prevent difficulty arising in the future or any doubt that those who obtain the St. John certificate are at liberty to join any body, it has been arranged that the substance of the speech of the assistant director shall be embodied in a circular, which will be sent out as soon as possible. I hope that statement will satisfy the noble Viscount on that important point.<lb/>
To return to the difficulties and friction that arose: The original agreement provided that all persons who joined voluntary aid detachments should have the certificate of the ambulance department of the Order of St. John, and it was feared that if certificates were accepted of other societies, or if certificates were given on an inferior course of training and examination, it would tend to lessen the value of the certificates of the St. John Ambulance Association. I need hardly say that it would be fatal to our work and to the work of ambulance altogether if in any way the value of those certificates were diminished. Not only would that be the case
<col>386</col>
in this country. It would be a fatal blow in India, where we have done magnificent work, helped by Lord Curzon, Lord Minto, Lord Kitchener, and, amongst others, by Lieut.-Colonel A. Yate, who did very good service in promoting that work; and also in almost every Colony (those with responsible government as well as Crown Colonies), where we have active working centres in close touch with the ambulance department here. Therefore to lessen the value of the certificate would he a dangerous thing, and I am glad that Lord Lucas recognises that. I need hardly point out, moreover, that the decision to allow an inferior certificate was a direct breach of the agreement that was entered into between us, the British Red Cross Society, and the War Office. Therefore after very careful consideration by what I may call the experts in this work&#x2014;the director of the ambulance department., the assistant director, and the executive committee&#x2014;it was decided that we could do better and help the War Office more easily and without friction if we acted independently; and to show that we were desirous in every way of continuing the work two resolutions were passed, one giving the reason why we separated from the War Office arrangement, and the other stating that the ambulance department &#x2014;
<quote>"will continue to carry on the work of instruction it has already inaugurated on a large scale, and will in such other ways as are open to the St. John Ambulance Association render assistance to those who desire to qualify themselves to give aid to the sick and wounded of the Territorial Force in time of war."</quote>
Turning to the actual scheme now put forward of having St. John Ambulance county companies, I may explain that it was felt to be necessary to give greater facilities to people who wished to undergo instruction and obtain certificates. Therefore these companies have been established in the counties, but every member who obtains the St. John certificate can join any body he pleases&#x2014;a voluntary aid detachment, or the brigade, or the ambulance association. I may add that every man arid woman who obtains the certificate of the St. John Ambulance Association and joins at any time one of these St. John county companies is bound to make a declaration to serve with the Territorial Force whenever it is mobilised in the event of war. Therefore under this
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0198"/>
<col>387</col>
system there will be thousands and thousands of trained men and women at the disposal of the County Associations and British Red Cross Society if they are wanted. Experience has shown that there is a different feeling in different counties. In Lancashire, for instance, as I am informed, there is a very small feeling in favour of the British Red Cross Society but a very strong feeling in favour of the work of the ambulance department of the Order of St.. John, and I think probably in that case most of the men and women who get certificates will prefer to join the St. John ambulance company. In sonic other counties&#x2014;Gloucestershire, I am told, and Devonshire, for instance&#x2014;the feeling is the other way. But, at all events, every man and woman who obtains our certificate is free to join whatever organisation lie or she prefers. I hope I have shown that we have in no way separated from the scheme of the War Office through any dislike of the work or any intention not to carry it on. It is quite the contrary. We hope to do the work more effectively in the future than we have been able to do it hitherto considering the differences of opinion that arose under the original agreement; and the result is that the War Office will have in time of war an enormous number of men and women all ready and bound to join the Territorial Force,</membercontribution></p>

I was under the impression that the noble Lord the Under-Secretary was going shortly to provide the County Associations with fresh instructions. I do not know whether it is desirable, certainly not so far as we are concerned, to wait until the advisory council have made up their mind on the matter. What I wish to specially emphasise to-night is that the County Associations who have had instructions to do this work are at a standstill because the foundation on which they were originally instructed to build has broken down. The scheme as represented by the diagram is admirable. You have at the head the War Office; following that you have the British Red Cross central office; then you get the County Associations all working in unison, the county branches of the Red Cross Society, the county directors appointed by those branches, and, finally, the voluntary
<col>388</col>
aid detachments. But those voluntary detachments are in the chrysalis state.<lb/>
In the first instructions the County Associations were made responsible for ambulance services for the Territorial Army. They were allowed, however, to delegate their powers to the Red Cross Society, and to that society alone; but in the original scheme, paragraph 22, County Associations in England were told that all persons wishing to join voluntary aid detachments should be in possession of the first aid and nursing certificates of the St. John Ambulance Association. And here I should like to add my meed of praise to the St. John Association for the admirable work they have done. It was, as I have said, originally contemplated that every man and woman before joining the voluntary aid detachments should be in possession of the St. John Ambulance certificate. I do not propose to deal with the differences of opinion that have unfortunately arisen, but I should like to say a word with regard to the county companies of the St. John Ambulance Association, which were also referred to by the noble Viscount who has just sat down. In most counties, although we may not have our voluntary aid detachments absolutely complete, we have the framework for them, and counties which have delegated their powers, as most have, to the Red Cross Society will be placed in a position of great difficulty if they have to compete with the county companies of the St. John Ambulance Association. Gloucestershire has already got forty-three voluntary aid detachments in full work, and they are very apprehensive of the difficulty which may arise.<lb/>
As to the question of certificates, I think we understood from what fell from the noble Lord that these certificates would be given by independent medical men. That, I take it, the St. John Association is very anxious to insist upon, and also that there should be no lowering of the present standard. The noble Viscount who initiated this discussion raised the question of instruction by nurses. To the ordinary mind instruction in home nursing given by a certified nurse is a very natural and desirable thing; but I believe the great difficulty in introducing the question of home nursing lies in the fact that the British Medical Union will have nothing to do with it. That Union is a very powerful body, and if that point is lost sight
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0199"/>
<col>389</col>
of we may again find ourselves in considerable difficulty with those medical men who are in the British Medical Union. I believe a great number of the most responsible medical men belong to that Union, and it is quite possible, unless we are very careful in this matter, that we may find ourselves in the difficulty of not having the necessary medical men to give the instruction and the help required. While we have up to now in many cases been able to depend on the generous assistance of the medical profession in giving instruction free, I understand that in certain parts of the country medical men have been instructed that they must be paid for the work they do. That, of course, would add very largely to our expenditure. I refer to these points because if we are to have a satisfactory solution they will have to be carefully considered.<lb/>
There were one or two other points raised in a discussion at a meeting of the Council of Territorial Associations, and I undertook that these points should be put before the noble Lord. As an impression has got about that members of voluntary aid detachments in time of war will receive ls. a day and rations, I should like to ask the definite question whether that is right or not, and whether any payments in money or kind will be given to Members of voluntary aid detachments. The other question which was raised, and which I undertook should be brought before the noble Lord's attention, was that of the county companies of the St. John Ambulance Association. If they are formed and officially recognised, will they in case of war be protected under the Geneva Convention? That is a point worthy of consideration, because it may make a considerable difference when the choice is offered to those interested whether they will join the voluntary aid detachments or the county companies of the St. John Association. We hear a good deal at one time and another about a free hand being given. I gather from what the noble Lord the Under-Secretary has said that County Associations are to be given a free hand in this direction; but where we have already formed voluntary aid detachments under the original scheme of the War Office, we shall be in a considerable difficulty. I would therefore urge that definite instructions should be given to County Associations at the earliest possible date.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INJURED TERRITORIALS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01017"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War whether any application had been made that pensions and allowances should be paid to the men of the 4th London (Howitzer) Brigade injured by a motor-van on August 12 last, and if so, what action His Majesty's Government proposed to take in the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01018">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the Question I have put on the Paper refers to an accident that happened on August 12 last year on Salisbury Plain. Your Lordships may, perhaps, remember that the 4th London (Howitzer) Brigade was returning to camp, I think after doing its annual firing, when a newspaper motor-van dashed into the rear of the column, hurling the men in all directions. Five of the men were so seriously injured that they were unable to return to their ordinary vocations for a considerable period, and two others were injured to such an extent that there is great doubt whether they will ever completely recover. I am informed that the owners of the motor-van, the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, have behaved with considerable liberality, but the men have not yet really received proper compensation. I believe I am correct in stating that there is no legal liability on the War Office to make any payment at all; but were these men employed by private individuals they would receive compensation under the Act, or if they were members of the Regular Forces they would receive the usual pensions and allowances. I think your Lordships will agree, therefore, that there is considerable moral obligation that some payment should be made to them. Perhaps it is going rather far to state that if the War Office behaved with generosity and promptitude in this case it would be an incitement to people to join the Territorial Force and be run over by a motor-van; but I think the noble Lord will agree that if a grievance, either real or imaginary, is allowed to continue in such cases, it will at any rate be a grave deterrent to recruiting, I therefore trust that the noble Lord will be able to assure the House that the claims of these men will be met in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01019"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one of the men injured in this unfortunate accident last year died; nine were treated in the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0200"/>
<col>391</col>
military hospital, two of whom were removed in November to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; and six men were treated in camp. I take it that the noble Earl's Question refers more particularly to the two men who were very seriously injured. They have just recently, 1 understand, left the civil hospital to which they went, and have, I very much regret to say, been discharged from the Territorial Force as being medically unfit to perform their duties. We deal with Territorials in such cases as this on exactly the same lines as we deal with Regulars. A man who has to be discharged from the Army as being unfit to perform his duties has a claim for a pension, and we have done with regard to these men what we should have done with regard to Regulars. We have forwarded their case to the Chelsea Commissioners, who are at the present moment considering whether they can give pensions in this case. As your Lordships know, the rules with regard to the granting of pensions are laid down, and they are rules from which we can never depart in any circumstances whatever. They are carefully drawn up and extremely fair. But I can assure your Lordships that the case of these men will receive the fullest consideration, and that they will be treated in every way exactly as if they were men of the Regular Army who had been injured. With regard to the other men whose injuries were not of what may be called a permanent character, we have a special method of treating such injured persons. Whilst they are in hospital or under medical treatment they draw for every day they are there a certain rate of pay, usually 3s. 6d. a day. I am sorry to say I have not been able to get accurate information as to whether those men have received the pay to which they are entitled, but 1 have no doubt they have. If the noble Earl has any information to the effect that they have not, I hope he will communicate with me, and. I will see that the money is paid, though I have every reason to believe it has been.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01020"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it would be satisfactory to your Lordships if my noble friend could give some assurance that if these pensions are not granted by the Commissioners and cannot come within the terms of the Army regulations, the greatest possible
<col>392</col>
pressure will be used by the War Office to obtain pensions from those who caused the injuries. If I recollect aright, it was the most disgraceful case of racing in the early morning that I ever heard of. The men in this motor-van, in the rush to sell their newspapers, drove right into this Brigade. There was a dense fog at the time, and when the motor-van was in the midst of the men the driver drove on and injured more. I never heard of a worse case, and it will be a national disgrace if these men do not receive pensions from some source.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE SUPER-TAX.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01021"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether the notice and form to be served on persons required to make a return of their total income from all sources for the purposes of assessment to Super-Tax, and attached to the Regulations made by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under Section 72 (8) of the Finance Act, 1910, and laid upon the Table of this House, are regarded by His Majesty's Government as part of the Regulations, and whether, in the event of the Commissioners altering the form at any future time, any revised form will be laid before Parliament as a Regulation under the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01022">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Question which I have on the Paper is of some importance considering what has been said in another place by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to the reconsideration which the Regulations for the Super-Tax may require. Under Section 93 of the Finance Act the Super-Tax Regulations have to lie on the Table of your Lordships' House for forty days. I take it that the object of Parliament was to ensure that the questions which were asked by the Treasury officials should be reasonable questions, and that the period within which those questions should be answered should give adequate time for getting the answers. The Question I ask is, Arc this return and this form regarded as part of the Regulations? If not, it is open to the Treasury officials as soon as the forty days expire to tear up this paper, to issue a totally new set of questions some of which it may be impossible to answer, to fine people for not answering them, and to change the period of time within
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0201"/>
<col>393</col>
which they have to be answered. The last sentence of the first paragraph of these Regulations runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Such notice shill be in the form hereto attached or in such amended form as the Commissioners of Inland Revenue shall approve."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01023">Section 93 of the Act says that all Regulations shall be laid on the Table, but what I want to make sure of is whether this Regulation which enables the Treasury to make other Regulations absolves them from laving those other Regulations on fie Table of the House. If so, it would leave the matter in the same position as if these forms were merely schedules and not part of the Regulations. I merely want an assurance that these questions arc not to be changed for totally different questions at the will and pleasure of the Treasury without being laid before Parliament, as was undoubtedly the intention of Parliament when the Finance Act was made law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01024"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first part of the noble Lord's Question is in the affirmative. The notice and form are part of the Super-Tax Regulations. As to the second part of the Question&#x2014;namely, whether in the event of the Commissioners altering the form at any future time any revised form will be laid before Parliament as a Regulation under the Act&#x2014;I am advised that any subsequent alteration of the form will not necessitate its being laid before Parliament. That is the legal position of the Treasury in the matter. But I should think it would be very unlikely that alterations of importance would be made off-hand by the Treasury without Parliament being aware of the fact; and, of course, it is always open to any member of either House of Parliament to criticise the Regulations which have been made. The noble Lord appears to think the Treasury capable of altering the Regulations merely for the purpose of having the pleasure of finding or punishing people who do not make a correct return. I must remind the noble Lord that all the Treasury want is to get the necessary information with the least possible trouble to the individual, and they are certainly not likely to take a course which will necessitate the making of further returns than are absolutely necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01025"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot quite understand the noble
<col>394</col>
Lord's answer. He began by telling me that both of these papers are part of the Regulations. Under the Act the Regulations have to be laid before Parliament. Consequently I presume, if there is any alteration in any part of this form, including the questions which have to be answered, that, being part of the Regulations, it would have to be laid before Parliament for forty days under Section 93 of the Act. But the second part of the noble Lord's answer contradicted that. The noble Lord said that if the Commissioners alter this form it would not be laid before Parliament. But if this form is a part of the Regulations it would be a breach of Section 93 not to lay it before Parliament. In those circumstances I do not understand the answer of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01026"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I am unable to explain the legal ground on which the Treasury have given me this information, but I have no doubt that their legal position in the matter is perfectly sound. I really do not think there is a contradiction in terms, as the noble Lord suggests, and it is obvious that it must be necessary for a Department to have this power. Very often the alteration made would be of a minor character, and it would be rather superfluous for the Department to have to lay a Paper before Parliament in every case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01027"><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is an important matter. I do not think any Department of the Government ought to have the power of really going contrary to the wish of Parliament owing to a technicality. The wish of Parliament evidently is that these matters should be laid on the Table of the House and be considered, but apparently it is in the power of the Treasury to get round the Act. That is, I think, a matter which the House ought very seriously to consider.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARMY HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01028"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War what arrangements are made at Whittington Barracks (Lichfield) for providing accommodation for nurses and hospitals for the women and children in the barracks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01029">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I have given the noble Lord notice of this Question,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0202"/>
<col>395</col>
but if he is not in a position to answer the particular point raised I have no doubt he will be able to inform me what is the usual practice and what system does exist in garrison towns for providing nurses and hospital accommodation. My attention has been called to the want of this accommodation in the case of Whittington Barracks, which are situated within three miles of Lichfield. It is a large garrison, and there are connected with it 242 women and 509 children. I am told that there is no sort of hospital accommodation for the women or any provision as to nurses. The local Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association has for the last few years provided a nurse to look after these women and children, but she is now on leave. She had to go away because there was considerable danger of her health breaking down, and the cause of that was the impossibility of procuring suitable lodgings in the neighbourhood of the barracks. That we hope, in course of time, to overcome; but as a matter of fact the nurse has had to go on leave, and there is no one to look after the women and children connected with this garrison. Whatever is done by the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association is, of course, private effort, and does not absolve the Government from responsibility in this respect. It has been suggested to me that there ought to be some form of women's hospital, or at any rate some military nursing sisters, to look after the women and children in these big garrison towns. By the July Army List I see that there are attached to the garrison of York five of these nursing sisters. I believe Lichfield has a larger garrison than York, and I am told that Lichfield has none of these nurses allotted to it. I hope that the noble Lord will undertake that full inquiry shall be made, and that he will find out the actual state of the case at Lichfield.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01030"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl was kind enough to send me notice of this Question, but I have not had time to inquire into the specific case. I can, however, tell your Lordships what is our general policy in matters of this kind. In certain of our larger garrisons we do maintain military hospitals. We also maintain them for some of the smaller garrisons if a civil hospital is nowhere within reach. We do not, however, maintain hospitals in what may be considered the smaller garrison towns. But where we have these
<col>396</col>
military hospitals, if there are more than 100 beds for soldiers we also maintain a certain number of beds and cots for women and children. We do not, however, recognise any actual responsibility with regard to that. In Lichfield we have not got a military hospital, and I am afraid we do not propose to maintain anything there in the nature of a hospital for women and children. We quite recognise and arc grateful for the work done by the organisation of which I think the noble Earl is the head in that county-, which maintains a nurse there. These women and children when they require special treatment can be admitted to the civil hospital, and if they do not require that they receive medical attendance in their own quarters. That is our general rule with regard to places such as Lichfield, and I am afraid it would be useless for me to hold out any hope to the noble Earl of our being able to modify that.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE AUTHORITY OF COLONIAL<lb/> GOVERNORS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01080"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he would consider the advisability of issuing detailed instructions to Governors-General and Governors in the self-governing Dominions of the Crown as to limits of their authority when acting its Governors-General or Governors in Council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01081">The noble Lord said: My Lords, my reason for putting the Question on the Paper which I am about to address to the noble Earl opposite is that circumstances have recently occurred which, I think, justify this House in asking that the position of Governors-General and Governors in Council in the self-governing Dominions shall be re-emphasised and fully explained. The circumstances to which I refer are the recent action of the Transvaal Legislature, which has already occupied the attention of His Majesty's Government in another place; but I think the discussion which took place in the House of Commons was inconclusive and unsatisfactory in its results, or, if it is to be deemed as conclusive, then I think the conclusion was so unsatisfactory as to warrant its further consideration by your Lordships. It is not my intention, on the present occasion, to enter into any close examination of the conduct of the late Transvaal Assembly, because, in the first place, that Assembly is defunct and no censure that we could pass upon it would be of any weight, and, in the second place, the time has passed when the Home Government could interfere with any effect in the matters with which it was then concerned.</p>
<col>402</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01082">It is possible that some of your Lordships and certainly a good many of the outside public are unfamiliar with the action of that Assembly, and therefore, with your Lordships' permission, I will very briefly refer to some of the salient: points of the case. I have in my possession an enormous mass of information which, if I desired to make any attack upon the Transvaal Assembly, would occupy more time than I should care to devote to the subject in your Lordships' House; but the main features of the case are these. By the Act of 1907 the members of the Transvaal Legislature were entitled to receive a salary of&#x00A3;300 a year, subject to certain deductions for non-attendance, in recompense for their Parliamentary services, and an ordinary session was defined to be a session in which the ordinary estimates of expenditure fur the administrative services of the year were considered. The second class of session was that described as extraordinary or special, upon which members were remunerated on a different basis; and according to the figures supplied to me the extraordinary session of that Assembly to which I am now seeking to draw attention would have entitled the members of the Lower House to a payment of&#x00A3;42, and the members of the Upper Chamber to a payment of&#x00A3;30. Nevertheless, the late Transvaal Assembly saw fit to pass a resolution transforming the extraordinary into an ordinary session, thereby putting into their pockets the difference between&#x00A3;42 and&#x00A3;32 and the&#x00A3;300 to which they would be entitled in an ordinary session.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01083">And it is to be noted, in connection with this, that the Assembly was politically on its death-bed. Its last few weeks of existence were running out, and its members had nothing to fear from any adverse criticism or judgment at the hands of the electors at the approaching polls, because the Transvaal Assembly was about to be merged into that larger body which was created by the establishment of the South African Constitution. Certain members of the Legislative Council took strong exception to the attitude of the majority of the Assembly and of the Ministers, and they took that exception on the ground that the provisions of the resolution were in direct conflict with the terms of the Payment of Members Act and the Audit and Exchequer Act of 1907. They held that if the terms of those Acts were to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0206"/>
<col>403</col>
be in any way altered or amended, it was proper and constitutional that it should be done by means of a Bill regularly introduced and passed in both branches of the Legislature, and they further held that the Governor's power to sanction extra expenditure by warrant was not applicable in a case when the House was actually in session, and when the matter could be constitutionally dealt with by Bill. Accordingly they raised this objection in the highest Court of the land, before the Chief Justice of the Transvaal, and with your Lordships' permission I will venture to read the expression of opinion delivered by the Chief Justice. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Necessary expenditure cannot be met by special warrant unless it occurs whet Parliament is not in session. The terms of Section 20 of the Act are perfectly clear upon that point. The breach of the law has therefore been proved."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01084">The action was, however, dismissed by the Chief Justice and his colleagues on the technical ground that the appealing members of the Legislative Council had no <i>locus standi</i> in that Court as mere taxpayers. But it is somewhat significant to note that the costs of the appeal were not, as I believe is usual, imposed upon the appellants, but their appeal was dismissed without costs. And in dismissing the appeal the Chief Justice said that, though they had no <i>locus standi</i> in their capacity as taxpayers&#x2014;
<quote>"The Constitution provides a remedy, and that remedy lies, in my judgment, in the intervention either of the Crown or of Parliament."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01085">I do not wish to go further into ancient history than just to say this, that I conceive that it is incredible that any person outside the ranks of those Transvaal Members who voted themselves increased salaries would contend that the payment of such increased salaries to themselves constituted any such grave case of public necessity or expediency as to justify any exceptional action by the Governor or anybody else in this case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01086">The more important point, however, which I wish briefly to discuss is not whether the Transvaal Assembly were right or wrong, but what is to be the future position of His Majesty's personal representatives in self-governing Dominions in their respective capacities of Governor-General personally and Governor in Council. So far as the personal authority of a Governor or Governor-General is concerned, I do not propose to trouble your Lordships
<col>404</col>
to-night. I think that upon the whole his personal position is fairly well defined; and, after all, his personal authority must always depend a great deal upon the man himself, upon how long an experience he has had with the Dominion in which he resides, and the extent to which he may be fortunate enough to find himself in possession of public confidence in his desire and attempts to discharge his duties honestly and efficiently. But the position of the Governor in Council is very much less simple, unless the latest pronouncements of His Majesty's Ministers in the House of Commons are to be taken as a definite and determined expression of policy, in which case his position will, indeed, be an extraordinary simple one, but one in which no previous Governor to my knowledge has ever yet found himself. On June 29, when the matter was being discussed in the House of Commons, Mr. Balfour asked whether it was the case that within a few days of the highest Court in the land saying that a course was illegal that course was to be taken by the Governor if his Ministers thought it right for him to do so, and the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies interjected "Yes." Well, my Lords, all I can say is that I cannot conceive that His Majesty's Government or any set of Ministers will allow so grave a constitutional position to be disposed of in so very summary a fashion. I do not wish to attach any undue or excessive importance to what may have been a mere interjection in the course of debate in another place, and my particular reason for calling attention to that interjection is that unless it is in some way explained or qualified by His Majesty's Government, it is quite certain to be quoted by self-governing Dominions as an expression of deliberate opinion by the Colonial Office upon any constitutional difficulties which may arise between the Governor representing His Majesty and the politicians in his particular Dominion; and, moreover, if that is to be considered as the final expression of opinion by His Majesty's Government I really fail to see what is the particular value of the Oath of Office which Governors-General and Governors are required to take when they assume responsibility over the seas. I think it might be really modified into this, "I swear to do whatever my Ministers tell me I am to do."</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01087">I may say, in connection with my own particular case, that whenever a Bill was
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0207"/>
<col>405</col>
presented to me when I had the honour to occupy office in Australia for signature as Governor-General in Council, it was my duty, and it was according to regulations, that I should obtain a certificate from the Attorney-General, acting in his legal capacity, that I might sign such a Bill constitutionally and without any violation of the law. But what is to become of that power or what is the use of that rule if it is to be overborne by the simple expression of Ministers' opinions? This doctrine is not only an entirely novel one, but it is absolutely inconsistent with all the precedents which have hitherto, I believe, guided His Majesty's representatives in the Dominions. I will venture to detain your Lordships with a few very brief quotations, and I do so with the less apology because they set forth the case which I wish to lay before His Majesty's Government more clearly and ably than I could hope to do myself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01088">The first quotation I will take is one from a Despatch addressed by Lord Cardwell to Sir Charles Darling in 1865. Lord Cardwell wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"In paying salaries without sanction of law you have departed from the principle of conduct announced by yourself and approved by us&#x2014;the principle of rigid adherence to the law. It is for you to take care that all proceedings taken in the Queen's name and under your authority arc consistent with the laws of the Colony."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01089">And in a Despatch addressed to Sir Charles Darling in 1866 Lord Cardwell wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"It is always the plain and paramount duty of the Queen's representative to obey the law and to take care that the authority of the Crown devised to his Ministers through him is exercised in conformity with the law."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01090">The Duke of Buckingham wrote to Lord Belmore, then in New South Wales, in 1868&#x2014;
<quote>"You would he <i>prima facie</i> bound to refuse to sign a warrant sanctioning any expenditure of public money which has not been sanctioned by law.''</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01091">The only exceptions which the Duke of Buckingham made in that Despatch were cases of grave public emergency or great public expediency, and, as I have ventured to suggest to your Lordships, the payment of a few hundred pounds of self-voted money to Members of Parliament can hardly come under either of these categories. Then Lord Granville wrote in 1869, also to Lord Belmore&#x2014;
<quote>"To require the Governor's warrant as a condition of the expenditure of public money would be
<col>406</col>
merely nugatory if the Governor was at liberty to issue that warrant for expenditure not justified by law. The mere fact that a certain number of public, officers would be put to a temporary inconvenience cannot be viewed as an unforeseen emergency, nor is it such a case of expediency as justifies a violation of the law."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01092">And in another Despatch Lord Granville wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"The obstacle imposed on Ministerial expenditure by requiring first the personal sanction of the Governor, in addition, of course, to the judgment of his Ministers, is a useful obstacle."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01093">The last quotation with which I will trouble your Lordships is one from Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, now Lord St. Aldwyn. Writing to Sir George Bowen in 1877 the noble Viscount said&#x2014;
<quote>"Your duty is to act on advice if satisfied that it is lawful. If not so satisfied, take your stand on the law."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01094">and later on in the same Despatch, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"It became then your duty to satisfy yourself that the action which your Ministers proposed that you should take was justified."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01095">I may venture to remind your Lordships that Sir Charles Darling was actually recalled and that Sir George Bowen was censured for failure to comply with the spirit of the instructions I have quoted. In that case it seems to me that Sir Charles Darling and Sir George Bowen if alive now might have felt themselves rather aggrieved, for what they carried out is, on the face of it, the present policy of His Majesty's Ministers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01096">I do not desire, in putting this Question, to suggest in any sort or kind of way that the position or the authority of a Governor should be amplified or extended. I do not think it would be fair to expect that of either His Majesty's present advisers or of any future advisers His Majesty may possess, because I am well aware that any such proposal would meet with the strongest opposition in the self-governing Dominions themselves. But I am equally anxious that such authority as Governors possess shall not be diminished; and, above all, that it shall be clearly and strictly defined. I have no desire to make this a Party question. The extracts which I have read to your Lordships are two of them from the Despatches of Liberal Colonial Secretaries and two from Conservative; and as the best evidence that I could give of my desire to keep these matters apart from Party questions, I
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0208"/>
<col>407</col>
felt it my duty, and a matter of courtesy, to furnish the noble Earl the Leader of the House with the material of the remarks which I have just ventured to make. I hold that alike in foreign, in Indian, and in Colonial matters, continuity of policy so far as possible is eminently desirable; but I do think that the recent action of the Transvaal Assembly presents a dangerous precedent, and one which certainly does call for a clearly-defined and well thought-out course of instructions to be laid down for His Majesty's representatives. It is in the hope that I may be fortunate enough to secure from His Majesty's Government a promise that they will take this matter into full and serious consideration and come to a determined deliberation upon it within a reasonable period of time that I now venture formally to ask the noble Earl the Question I have put on the Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01097"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF ST ATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord opposite has in his Question raised a subject of deep interest, and he has done so in a tone of moderation and responsibility which one would have expected, not only from his personal character, but also from, one who has filled the high offices abroad which he has occupied with so much distinction. I am grateful to him also for having, as he told the House, supplied me with the materials of what he was about to say. I heartily agree with him that this is not a matter in any sense of a Party character, and fortunately it cannot be regarded as a Party matter either in this country or in South Africa owing to the actual circumstances in which the events occurred to which the noble Lord has alluded.<lb/>
The noble Lord has correctly and clearly described what took place with regard to this question of payment of Members in the extraordinary session which was held in the Transvaal in April last. As he told us, there was a fixed scale of&#x00A3;300 a year, less&#x00A3;2 a day for non-attendance, in an ordinary session, whereas in an extraordinary session payment was only&#x00A3;10 for the session, <i>plus</i>&#x00A3;2 a day for attendance, working out, as the noble Lord said, in this instance to&#x00A3;42 in the case of the Assembly. On April 28 last the Assembly met in session and decided that it was proper, for reasons which seemed
<col>408</col>
good to them, to treat that particular session as though it were an ordinary session for the purposes of this payment. The question, as I have said, was not a Party one, because I think I am right in saying that the proposal was made by a Minister and was seconded by one of the leaders of the Opposition. The proposal was not submitted to the Legislative Council, and on the same day Parliament was prorogued. Then the application of which the noble Lord has spoken was made to the Supreme Court, and was refused on May 10 on the grounds which he has told the House. It is quite clear that the mere resolution of the Assembly carried with it no power to make this payment. Therefore the point that was brought before the Supreme Court was a simple one in itself, and although the case was dismissed because those who brought it forward were held to have no <i>locus standi</i>, yet it was quite clear that on the facts as they were at that time&#x2014;on May 10&#x2014;no warrant existed for the payment being made.<lb/>
Then the Transvaal Government decided to proceed in a different manner, and they applied themselves to Section 20 of the Audit and Exchequer Act, 1907, to which the noble Lord has alluded. Section 20 of that Act runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"If at any time when Parliament is not in session it should appear to the Governor to be necessary</quote>
that is to say, the Governor in Council&#x2014;
<quote>"in the public interest that an issue of public moneys should be made for any purpose not authorised by law, he may by special warrant under his hand authorise such issues as may be required from time to time for such purposes";</quote>
and the Governor in Council was asked under that section to authorise the payment, Parliament not being at that time in session. In the course of the ease the Chief Justice indicated, as the noble Lord, I think, has stated, that he did not consider that particular course to be a. proper one. But, on the other hand, it has to be remembered that the point was not before him. It was an <i>obiter dictum</i> of the Judge, and although, of course, it was entitled to every weight and consideration, yet it was not a decision in the case, because the point had never been raised. Therefore I think it is reasonable to state, whatever may be thought of the circumstances in which the payment was made by warrant of the Governor, that it was not an illegal payment. It fulfilled the conditions of the Act of Parliament, and consequently
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0209"/>
<col>409</col>
I do not see how anybody can hold that the payment was in itself an illegal one. That was the view which the officer at that time administering the government at the Transvaal took after having applied to me for my opinion, and I, of course, obtained the best advice I could, and I take full responsibility for the decision that the payment in those circumstances came within the four corners of the Act of Parliament, and was, therefore, not illegal. In that respect, therefore, this case appears to me to differ <i>in toto</i> from those Australian cases to which the noble Lord alluded&#x2014;all cases which I entirely agree are well worth closely looking into. They are cases of great interest from many points of view, but in every one of those cases the payments which the Governor was invited to authorise were not payments authorised by law. He was asked to go outside Parliamentary powers and to make the payment by executive action. In this ease the condition is precisely opposite. Whatever the view may be as to the wisdom of the particular transaction, with which, I think, we here are not concerned, I repeat that it cannot be maintained, in my opinion, that the payment was in itself an illegal one.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite quoted a sentence, or rather a very short interjection in another place by my right hon. friend the Under-Secretary in my Department. I have the <i>Hansard</i> report in my hand. Mr. Balfour said&#x2014;
<quote>"Do I understand the right hon. gentleman to lay down the proposition that within a few days of the highest Court in the land saying that a course is illegal that course is to be taken by the Governor if his Ministers think it right for him to do so?"</quote>
and Colonel Seely is reported as having replied "Yes." What I am given to understand Colonel Seely really said was&#x2014;
<quote>"Yes, in this particular case";</quote>
meaning, thereby, not that the course was illegal, because the Solicitor-General had just before stated in the debate that the course was not illegal, but that in this particular case the Governor was justified in taking the course he did.<lb/>
To come to the wider question, I think the. House will see that if the Governor in Council in a case of this kind is to exercise the sort of discretion which the noble Lord desires hint to be able to exercise, you may be getting on to somewhat dan
<col>410</col>
gerous ground. The Act says that it is necessary in the public interest that an issue of public money should be made by the Governor with the advice of his Ministers. Is the noble Lord prepared to lay down as a general proposition that in a case where the Governor in Council is asked to arrive at an opinion of that kind he should be the sole judge of what is or is riot the public interest? Because if you lay down any proposition of that kind you will find that ultimately you will he transferring the final decision in all these cases from the Governor in Council to the Governor in person. I quite admit that there may be cases in which the Governor in Council would be right to put the strongest pressure on his Ministers not to proceed with a. particular point. I also admit that it is quite arguable that this particular discretion ought to be in the hands of the Governor and not in the hands of the Governor in Council, and it is open to any noble Lord to say that the Act of 1907 should have been passed in that form; but since it is not so, and if the terms are so general as they are in this Section 20, I confess that, once the Governor is satisfied that the act is not illegal, as he and those who advised hint were in this case, if the matter is pressed by the Ministers the Governor acting as Governor in Council has no choice but to comply. For that reason I find it very difficult, although 1 am willing, of course, at the noble Lord's invitation to take the whole matter into consideration, to lay down any general proposition which can be put in the form of instructions to Governors and Governors-General on matters of this kind.<lb/>
As the noble Lord has said, where the Governor acts alone the position is comparatively simple. There he has practically a complete discretion, subject, of course, to his relations with the Department at home. I think I am right in saying&#x2014;the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that so far as South Africa is concerned the only two subjects on which a Governor has absolute discretion are those with regard to the prerogative of mercy and the reservation of Bills. On those his discretion is absolute. Then you come to a class of questions where admittedly illegal action is proposed. I think we should all be prepared to say, and we should found our opinion on the instructions to Governors, that it can only be in cases of most supreme public necessity that the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0210"/>
<col>411</col>
Governor, acting in concert with his Ministers, could approve of illegal action. But those cases are, of necessity, exceedingly rare, and for this reason. The action would not, I should think, in nineteen cases out of twenty be pronounced illegal until after it had been taken&#x2014;that is to say, the matter would have to come at a later stage before a Court of law before the action in itself could be pronounced illegal; and it must be remembered, as the noble Lord very truly pointed out, that the Governor has his Attorney-General and his legal advisers, and he presumably, not as a. rule being a legal expert himself, is bound to take the view of the state of the law from them. That being so, I do not think it is reasonable or necessary to lay down instructions for a Governor as to what he is to do if action is proposed to him which he considers illegal.<lb/>
But, my Lords, when you come to say what a Governor is to do when he is asked to take action which may be described as unconstitutional, you get into a far more difficult order of ideas. The word unconstitutional is sometimes very vaguely used. It was used, I think, both of the action of His Majesty's Government and of the Opposition during the last year with great freedom on many platforms. But, speaking generally, one has to remember this. The Governor has, of course, in theory vast power. He can practically, by his instructions, refuse to agree to anything that his Ministers propose; but, on the other hand, he has to act with Ministers, and if not with those Ministers he must find some other Ministers with whom he can act; and I am sure the noble Lord will agree with me that if it came to be the practice that Governors or Governors-General got into the habit of raising objections to particular propositions because they considered them unconstitutional or undesirable in a public sense&#x2014;if they got into the habit of regularly and publicly objecting, we should get into a state of friction with the self-governing Dominions which the noble Lord would be, I am sure, the last man to desire. The fact is, my Lords, that the working of responsible government, and, indeed, the working of all Parliamentary government, depends upon a series of understandings which it is hardly possible to reduce to the form of black and white. For that reason I confess I should find it very difficult to attempt to frame any fresh set
<col>412</col>
of instructions to Governors-General or to Governors in the manner which the noble Lord seems to desire, though, as I have said, in consideration of the arguments he has used and of his experience I will give the fullest consideration to the Question he has asked me.<lb/>
I repeat that in this particular Transvaal case I do not consider that we are called upon to express any opinion whatever on the policy which was adopted in that final sitting of the Legislative Assembly, all the more because, though I am in as good a position to know as most people, I am not aware what the precise reasons were which actuated both parties in the Legislative Assembly to make this particular proposition. Of course, the money to be found was South African money, and the public opinion which matters in a case of this kind is South African public opinion and not public opinion here; and therefore, so far as that side of the matter is concerned, I am disposed to leave it there. I hope I have dealt with the various points raised by the noble Lord, and I can assure him once more that I will give the fullest consideration to his suggestion, though not with much hope of being able to arrive at anything like detailed instructions to Governors-General and Governors, because it appears to me that each case as it arises is almost certain to differ from any previous case, and can, therefore, only be dealt with on its merits.</membercontribution></p>

The point that is of importance is the construction to be given to the words that a Governor is to act on the advice of his Council. If the construction which appears to be given by the noble Earl is to be the construction in South Africa, it must be the construction in England. The words are the same. In a great many instances His Majesty has to act upon the advice of his Council, but
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0211"/>
<col>413</col>
it certainly would be a novel proposition to suggest that he is to be a mere puppet and is to do exactly what his Ministers advise. I agree with the noble Earl that where the question concerned is one of policy or of what it is expedient for the Colony to do, that is the sort of thing that must necessarily be left to those who are the advisers of the Governor for the time being; but the point here is whether the Governor is bound to do that which he knows to be illegal, and therein I am surprised to hear the noble Earl say that the Solicitor-General, Sir Rufus Isaacs, ever suggested that he was so bound. I have here the report of what he said, and certainly his words do not bear this out; and knowing what an excellent lawyer Sir Rufus Isaacs is, I should be surprised indeed to hear that he ever committed himself to any such opinion.</membercontribution></p>

That was declared in the course of the ease to be illegal. It had only passed one House, whereas the payment could only be properly made if the Bill bad passed both Houses.

It was spending money without Parliamentary authority in the sense that both Houses had agreed to it, and against the authority of the law. To render it legal by the warrant of a Governor who is only authorised to do this in a case of great emergency is, I venture to submit, absolutely unprecedented.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MINES ACCIDENTS (RESCUE AND AID)<lb/> BILL.</title>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01110">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01111"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill which comes to us from another place with, I am glad to say, the general approval of everybody interested in the matter. The object of the Bill is to enable the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, by Order, to require that provision shall be made at all mines for the supply and maintenance of appliances for use in rescue work and the formation and training of rescue brigades, and also for the supply and maintenance of ambulance appliances and the training of men in ambulance work. The first remark that I ought to make is, perhaps, that His Majesty's Government are very anxious not to interfere with the work which has already been done, and very well clone indeed, by a number of mine owners in different parts of the country; but one practical result of this Bill will be to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0212"/>
<col>415</col>
compel provision for rescue and aid in case of accidents to be made wherever, in the opinion of the Home Office, it may be thought desirable to do so. There is legislation of this kind in various countries abroad, and in this matter we arc following the example of Austria, France, Belgium, and most of the coal-mining states of Germany. The whole of this question was considered by the Royal Commission on Mines which was appointed in 1906. A good deal of attention was drawn to it by a dreadful catastrophe which happened at the Courrieres Mines in 1903, when a large number of men lost their lives. Interest was awakened afresh in the matter by a second disaster which happened at the Whitehaven Colliery this year, which resulted in the loss of over one hundred lives, and it was felt by the Home Office that if this organisation had been available at the time some of those lives might have been saved. The Home Office thought the matter could no longer be left to voluntary effort, and that legislation was necessary in order to bring those who lagged behind the general standard up to that which had been already reached by the more generous owners. In this matter the Home Secretary was strongly supported by those who spoke on behalf of colliery proprietors both on the Second Reading and on the introduction of the Bill. The method of the Bill follows the precedent in the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1896, by which the Secretary of State is empowered to make Orders as to the use of explosives. Exception was taken to some clauses in the Bill as originally introduced, and accordingly Amendments were agreed to by the Home Secretary which provided that if any objection is made to a draft Order, the Order shall not be made by the Secretary of State until that objection has been referred to a referee agreed upon between the Secretary of State and the objectors, or, in default of agreement, appointed by the Lord Chief justice. As this Bill has passed through the other House with the general approval of all parties, I venture to hope that it will meet with an easy and a safe passage in your Lordships' House. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COMPANIES (CONVERTED SOCIETIES) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01114" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01115">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01116"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a very short Bill consisting of a single clause and dealing with a single point. Its object is to validate the transactions of certain companies which have been entered into in perfectly good faith and in accordance with what was believed to be the law at the time, but which, in consequence of recent legal decisions, are now believed to be invalid. I can explain to your Lordships in a very few words how this situation has arisen. Under the Friendly Societies Act of 1896, and also under the former Acts, friendly societies were permitted to convert themselves into limited liability companies by following certain procedure. That procedure was laid down in Section 71 of the Act of 1896. This section was somewhat modified by the Insurance Companies Bill of last year. I need not, however, deal with that point, because all these transactions took place under the former law. Under that law what had to be done was that a special general meeting of the friendly society was called and at that meeting a special resolution was submitted authorising the conversion. That resolution also set forth the powers which it was proposed to confer upon the new company, and if that resolution received the requisite support the conversion could then take place, and the terms of the resolution were incorporated in the memorandum of agreement of the new company.<lb/>
It was always supposed by every one who has given any attention to the matter that, provided they did not contravene the ordinary company law and the assurance companies law, any powers might be taken by the new company which they deemed to be desirable, and on that understanding a number of conversions have taken place and the companies have carried on business ever since. Recently a series of legal decisions have been given under which it is laid down that a friendly society, in converting, could only confer upon the new company powers which it itself possessed, and therefore the restrictions imposed by the Friendly Societies Acts would also be imposed upon the new company. The result of that is that certain transactions which have been entered into,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0213"/>
<col>417</col>
as I say in perfectly good faith, are now believed in all probability to be illegal and irregular.<lb/>
In the ease of one particular company which has been brought to the notice of the Board of Trade 1,000,000 policies arc believed in all probability to be invalidated&#x2014;policies issued to insure small sums of money, but amounting in the aggregate to&#x00A3;18,000,000. It would he very hard upon the management of these societies and upon the policy-holders that this state of affairs should be brought about, and what it is proposed by this Bill to do is to say that these transactions&#x2014;transactions which have been entered into up to the passing of this Act&#x2014;shall be made valid, but that for the future all these companies will have to conform to the law as it at present stands. This Bill has passed through the House of Commons without any opposition. I hope your Lordships will agree that it is right that this relief should be given to these people, who, through no fault or carelessness of their own, now find themselves in a very difficult position. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>418</col>
House. The Home Office think it needs some small amendment, but that is a matter which will come up in Committee. I may say, shortly, that the Children Act made it a criminal offence for any person having the control or custody of a girl under sixteen years of age to bring about her seduction or her prostitution. A case was tried where a girl of that age, by the influence and power of the person having control over her, was put into an immoral way of acting, but as it was not for the purposes of money it was therefore not prostitution. The Judge who tried the case recommended a conviction, but on appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal declared that where it was not prostitution it was not an offence. It has been felt that that is a blot which ought to be remedied, and the object of this Bill is to remedy it. As I have said, the words of this Bill go, perhaps, a little too far; but if your Lordships will read it a second time the matter of limitation can be considered in Committee.

for myself, and I expect for not a few others, I was by no means unwilling to defer to the opinion expressed by the noble and learned Lord that additions should not, if possible, be made to the Magisterial Bench pending the consideration of the Report of the Commissioners; but the number of aspirants for the coveted honour has mounted up. Parliament will shortly be adjourning and as Quarter Sessions will meet in the recess I venture to suggest that it would be a matter of considerable convenience if the Lord Chancellor could give us some idea what steps he proposes to take on the Report of the Commission. I beg to ask the Question that stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01129"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>:My Lords, I welcome very heartily the Report of the Royal Commission, and I believe the result of its recommendations will be to break down the unfortunate tradition that Justices of the Peace should be appointed to that office as a reward for political services. It is an event of great importance that a Commission composed of men of all parties and opinions, whose authority cannot be doubted, should have unanimously declared that all concerned might to decline to recognise political or religious opinions as any ground for qualification or disqualification. I also thoroughly agree in the unanimous opinion of the Commissioners that it is not in the public interest that there should be an undue preponderance of Justices drawn from one political party. The proper course is to discard political influences altogether, and to appoint the most suitable men for this responsible office in such a way that the Bench shall command the complete confidence of the community.<lb/>
In regard to the practical recommendations made by the Royal Commission, I am prepared in substance to adopt them, and I express the hope that all who are interested&#x2014;Lords Lieutenant, members of both Houses, and the existing body of Justices&#x2014;will co-operate in a settlement of this question on the lines of the Report.
<col>420</col>

For the next two or three months there will be a close time, if I may use the expression, but I shall offer to the Lords Lieutenant proposals and suggestions before the expiration of the holidays and before Parliament meets again, and I sincerely hope we shall be able to agree as to suitable steps to be taken to carry out the Report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01203">Amendment, moved&#x2014;</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01206">(2) The following subsection shall be substituted for subsection (4) of section sixty of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1882:
<quote>"Every person entitled to vote may vote for one person and no more by signing and personally delivering to the chairman a voting paper containing the surname and other names and place of abode and description of the person for whom he votes."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Courtney of Penwith.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01207"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hardly think that my noble friend in moving this new clause and also later on proposing to move to alter the title of the Bill is -within the question of order, but perhaps I might, in a few words, state the reasons why the Local Government Board object to the insertion of this new matter. The Bill, as your Lordships are aware, simply desires to apply the principles laid down in the Local Government Act of 1888 to the election of aldermen and mayors in municipal boroughs. My noble friend's Amendment would go very much beyond the range of this amending Bill. The Bill, as it refers to the election of aldermen, is designed only to limit the persons who may vote for aldermen in municipal boroughs. The Amendment would alter the whole system of election. Secondly, the Bill is limited in its scope to the election of aldermen and mayors in municipal boroughs. The Amendment would affect
<col>430</col>
the election of aldermen in the case of county councils and apparently also of metropolitan boroughs.<lb/>
I think your Lordships will realise that these alterations go entirely outside the scope of the Bill. The Bill passed through another place with no Amendments at all, and, as I have said, it desires to assimilate in these two small particulars the procedure in municipal borough councils to that in county councils and metropolitan borough councils. On the Second Reading the noble Lord said he was in sympathy with the Bill, but I think his Amendments not only introduce entirely new matter into this very bumble and unpretentious Bill, but would cause a certain amount of difference of opinion with reference to the provisions laid down for county councils and metropolitan borough councils as regards the election of aldermen. In these circumstances I venture to hope that the noble Lord will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01208"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the observations I addressed to your Lordships on the Second Reading of this Bill I explained pretty fully the process by which I propose to enlarge the provisions of this Bill, and I stated the reasons which led me to believe that that process was quite legitimate. It is a surprise to me, therefore, to hear the statement, which the noble Earl has just made. I took some pains to consider the matter, and what I propose to do appeared to me to be perfectly in order. Nor do I understand from the noble Earl that he ventures the opinion that the Amendments are out of order. He says they are inconvenient, but nothing more. I think it would be unfortunate if your Lordships were to consent to the opinion that this proposal was out of order, because it would fetter your action very seriously in regard to other Bills which might be held to be of more importance than the present one.<lb/>
What is the situation? This Bill proposes to deal with the election of aldermen in the provincial boroughs of England, and it provides that whereas at present aldermen and common councillors have equal rights in the election of aldermen, in future aldermen should be denied the privilege of joining in the election of aldermen and that it should be confined to common councillors alone. That is the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0220"/>
<col>431</col>
scope of the Bill, and the title of the Bill as introduced into the other House was so closely prescribed that it was impossible by the rules to make any alteration there in the provision contained in the Bill as introduced. My noble friend said that no Amendment was made in the other House. But, as I have said, the adroitness of the draftsman of the Bill prevented the introduction in the other House of any Amendment such as I am now moving. What I propose to do is to continue the provision that only common councillors can elect aldermen by adding that each common councillor shall have only one vote in the election of aldermen, so that the aldermen elected should correspond to the composition of the common council.<lb/>
What is desired in the election of aldermen is to bring in, if possible, expert knowledge and experience which cannot be introduced by the ordinary process of election. By my Amendment that would be secured in a full instead of in a partial way as proposed in this Bill. The alteration contained in the Amendment is a very simple one in the body of the Bill, and it is necessary to alter the title in order to correspond to that alteration. But that is not out of the power of your Lordships. It would be irregular to go entirely beyond the scope and purpose of this Bill, but you may enlarge it by adding to the provision that only common councillors shall vote a prescription as to the way in which those councillors shall vote. I am unwilling to go into the arguments regarding the merits of this Amendment because this embarrassing question has been raised. I do not wish to enter into conflict with the general opinion of your Lordships. It. may be that the subject I have raised in this Amendment is one which should be deferred for further consideration, and if I assented to the negativing of my Amendment it would be on that ground and on that ground only&#x2014;namely, that it is desirable that the matter should be further considered by the municipal corporations throughout the country. It is unfortunate that in regard to an Amendment such as this we should be confronted with an official attitude of pure negation. I said in my speech on the Second Reading that the process of carrying a Bill through the Legislature now is a series of man&#x0153;uvres, and the way in which this Bill was drafted and piloted through the other House of
<col>432</col>
Parliament by the Department concerned was most adroit. I hope your Lordships will not assent to the suggestion that to insert my Amendment is beyond your Lordships' power. Negative it, if you like, on the ground that the question should be further discussed, but do not, I pray you, negative it on the ground put forward by the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01209"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have risen but for a remark made by Lord Courtney when he introduced this subject on the last occasion, and from which 1 am afraid your Lordships might derive an idea entirely at variance with the facts. The noble Lord based this Amendment largely on what he described as the recent action of the London County Council&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01210"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: I mentioned that incidentally. I did not base the Amendment upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01211"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Lord mentioned it incidentally, perhaps I may be allowed to show incidentally what the effect would have been in that particular case if the plan contained in this Amendment had been carried out. I will not trouble your Lordships with past procedure, though I could have shown that as long as the Progressives were in a majority in the London County Council it was their practice to attach to themselves aldermen more or less of the same way of thinking, just as was done by the other side recently. I quite sympathise with the noble Lord opposite, who would all through, if he could, have introduced the principle of proportional representation; but he is endeavouring now to build on a foundation a superstructure which really it will not carry.<lb/>
The effect of the noble Lord's Amendment in the case of the last London County Council election would have been this. At the last election in March there was practically a tie, sixty members being elected on the one side as against fifty-eight on the other. But those sixty members were elected by a majority of 79,000 erectors. Yet bad the noble Lord's plan been in operation and had it been impossible for the sixty members to obtain more than a majority of one in the aldermen over the fifty-eight members, you would literally have had the government of London being
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0221"/>
<col>433</col>
carried On by two parties within two of each other in the division lobby, although a majority of 79.000 electors had supported the party which was supposed to be in power. That would have meant an absolute deadlock. I am not going to discuss what I believe to be the entire undesirability of these battles being fought out on Party lines, but the fact remains; and I urge that, unless your Lordships were prepared to go into the whole of this question, very serious inconvenience would be caused if at the last moment the noble Lord were allowed to take the ease of the aldermen as a single instance out of the rest and proceed to apply to them a principle which is entirely at variance with the majority principle established with reference to the rest of the representation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01212"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has brought in incidentally the question of what happened after the last election to the London County Council, and I understood him to say that the Progressives did very much the same thing in days gone by. Well, I have had the honour of serving on the London County Council for fifteen years as a member of the Progressive Party; I have fought five of, perhaps, the fiercest fights that were ever fought in connection with that body, and I most unhesitatingly declare that the statement of the noble Viscount is inaccurate in the highest degree. He said that very much the same thing was done by the Progressives in the past as was done by the Moderates on the last occasion. This year the election resulted in a tie, and on a recount the Moderates had a majority of two. And how was that obtained? It was obtained on a recount by a single vote-But, contrary to an acknowledged custom that has prevailed in the London County Council, the Moderates took to themselves all the aldermen. They did not give the Progressives one single aldermanic vote. The result was that this gave them a total majority of seventeen. So far from this having been anything like the policy of the Progressives in days gone by, w hat happened on the last occasion was one of the worst instances of political juggling that has ever discredited municipal life in London.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01213"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid that after that ebullition of feeling on the
<col>434</col>
part of the noble Earl I must trouble your Lordships again. Will the noble Earl carry his mind back to his statement at the beginning of his remarks, that what I had said was inaccurate in the highest degree? Will he deny that when his party were in a majority in 1889 they took all the aldermen? And that in 1892 they again took all the aldermen? And will he deny that in 1895, when there was a tie and the Progressives were in a minority of 29,244 at the polls, they took such a number of aldermen as gave them a majority of seven in the council? Will the noble Earl say I am inaccurate in that statement? [No answer.] Then I hope he will withdraw the previous remark he made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01231"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> moved to amend paragraph (<i>c</i>) by omitting the words "certified midwives" in order to insert "persons, one a midwife." The noble Lord said: The object of this Amendment is to give two representatives to the Incorporated Midwives Institute and to preserve to them their representation by a medical practitioner which they have found very convenient and valuable in the past. I must say that it seems to me rather shabby to give the Midwives Institute only one representative when you see how little representation of midwives there is on the Board. There are very good reasons, 1 think, for giving them at any rate two representatives. The Midwives Institute is the only incorporated body representa-
<col>436</col>
tive of all the practising midwives in the country, who number at least 15.000, I believe. It was that association which raised the large fund necessary for carrying the Midwives Act of 1902, a measure which is now fully recognised to be one of great public utility. It meant a considerable amount of effort. It took twelve years to get that Act passed and there was all the labour connected with six successive Bills. The Incorporated Midwives Institute have, therefore, good reason to claim that they speak for the practising midwives in the country; and, indeed, there is no other association which can claim to represent the midwives in the same way. I do not know why it is necessary to restrict them to only one representative, and the effect of doing so is to make the unlucky number thirteen the number of the Board. I hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will be willing to make this small concession, more particularly as past experience has shown that it is very convenient that midwives should have a medical practitioner to speak for them. The noble Earl has strengthened the medical representation on the Board, and I do not think it need be argued that it is easier for a man and a doctor to hold his own against the eminent physicians who will be on the Board than it would be for a midwife.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01233"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will see that this is a Bill for amending the Midwives Act and in order to strengthen the Central Midwives Board. With that in view it was naturally thought by those who were concerned in this Bill that it was very desirable that we should have midwives upon the central body itself. We think we have now reached a stage in the development of the Act when we can count upon midwives whose services on the Board would be of great value. Your Lordships must agree that prima facie there is good reason for putting midwives upon a board which is concerned with the everyday work and duty of midwives throughout the country. That is the first reason why I hope your Lordships will allow this to stand as it is at present. I admit it is quite possible that a doctor would be able also to help the midwives in any case which might come before the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0223"/>
<col>437</col>
Midwives Board if he was there as a representative of the Incorporated Midwives Institute. But, as I think I told your Lordships on the Second Reading, in the case of mixed bodies one can only arrive at their constitution after a good deal of balancing of the various interests, and any alteration is apt to disturb the balance. However, I am not particularly wedded to the form as it appears in the Bill at the present time, and if any considerable number of your Lordships express a. desire to see the first Amendment which the noble Lord opposite has moved adopted, I shall not enter ally strong objection to it. But at the same time I wish to make it quite clear that if this Amendment is agreed to I should only agree to it as an expression of opinion from more than one noble Lord. I should like to be certain that there are several members of your Lordships' House who think that this Amendment is desirable before we agree to it, because the present scheme is the outcome of much consideration and ought not to be disturbed without good reason. The second Amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord is that the Royal British Nurses Association should be represented by anybody other than a certificated midwife. I should oppose that. As I said before, we want midwives upon this Board, and the Royal British Nurses Association would be able to send us a. certificated midwife whose services would be of real value. Therefore, though I should like to express once more a preference for the scheme in the Bill, yet if there is a decided expression in your Lordships' House in favour of adding one member to the Board as representative of the Incorporated Midwives Institute I should be willing to agree to that Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01234"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is only fair to point out that this Amendment:, after all, is only permissive. It does not prevent the Incorporated Midwives Institute appointing two midwives if they think that they are the two best people they could appoint. On the other hand, it does give them latitude in the case of one of their appointments. If they have a member of the medical profession or anybody else whom they think specially fitted for the business, they are able to appoint him.

Earl asked if anybody was prepared to support the Amendment which my noble friend has moved, I may say that I certainly came down to the House with the object of supporting it; and I notice that the form in which my noble friend moves this proposal is the form in which it recommends itself to the Royal British Nurses Association.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01239"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> moved another Amendment to the subsection to give to the Royal British Nurses Association the option of appointing on the Board a representative other than a certified midwife. The noble Lord said: I am sorry the noble Earl seemed to make it a condition of his acceptance of the first part of the Amendment, for which I am very much obliged to him, that the second part should not be pressed; but I had no opportunity of assenting to that arrangement, and I am afraid I must press this second Amendment. It is very much desired, and, as my noble friend Lord Donoughmore pointed out, it is permissive; and it seems to me to be very desirable that there should be a certain amount of latitude and elasticity in this arrangement. By the Amendment already accepted the noble Earl will have one midwife anyhow on the council.</p>

As the Bill now stands they are given one representative on the Board who must be a midwife. The Royal British Nurses Association desire to have the option of appointing such person as they may think their best representative for the time being. There is no suggestion that they would not appoint a midwife. They might appoint a midwife if they considered that their interests would be best represented by a midwife. But upon the Council of the Royal British Nurses Association there are thirty doctors, thirty matrons, and thirty nurses, and the whole society is composed of these elements. They do not, therefore, want to be confined solely to midwives as their representatives. This body is probably the largest and most important nursing association in the kingdom. It is the only body of its kind which has a Royal Charier, and they feel that they are a body quite competent to choose their best representative, and that in many cases they may not be able to find a midwife free and able to</membercontribution></p>

You now have a body of fourteen. It is not unreasonable, I think, to suggest that in these circumstances two out of the fourteen should be midwives. We quite realise the work which is accomplished by the Royal British Nurses Association. We know they include among their members a large number of midwives who would be admirably fitted to serve on this Board. We need midwives upon it, we think the Royal British Nurses Association able to send us a good midwife, and in these circum stances I must insist on the clause as it stands.</membercontribution></p>

If you turn to Clause 7 you will see that the obligation suggested is that the certified midwife should send to the Central Midwives Board. The object is to keep the roll clean and up to date. The roll is in the charge of the Central Midwives Board, and surely it would be most inconvenient if the midwife were to write to a local authority which had not got the roll in its charge. The Central Midwives Board is the body whose duty it is to keep the roll in order, and it would be a matter of great inconvenience if nurses were to send to authorities not responsible in any way for the roll. The scheme as proposed in the Bill is far more convenient than the somewhat roundabout method suggested in the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01277"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> moved, after the word "Act" ["who has not given to the local supervising authority such a notice as is mentioned in section ten of the principal Act"] at the commencement of the clause; to insert the words "or a woman not so certified." The noble Earl said: This clause is really founded upon Section 93 in the Report of the Departmental Committee. The real fear was this, that monthly nurses and so on who are not certified midwives would act nominally under a doctor, but that the doctor might not be present at the moment, and that some danger might accrue to the mother in those circumstances. We thought it desirable to make the Central Midwives Board acquainted with the fact if it became a habit in any district. The method, I admit, is clumsy, but there is no other way of doing it. Naturally the Midwives Board would take no notice if it happened occasionally; but if there was a sign of its becoming a habit they would be able to take such steps as might seem necessary. The objection which has been stated to me privately is that as the Bill stands at the present moment it does throw a certain amount of duty upon the certificated midwife which would rather act unfairly towards her and might make her employment, perhaps not so popular. For that reason I have put down this Amendment, which I think would put all nurses upon the same footing and therefore give the certificated midwife an equal opportunity with others. I hope that will meet the view of the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, who has given notice to move the deletion altogether of subsection (1).</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01301">13. A local supervising authority may aid the training of midwives, whether within or without their area, and may make grants for the purpose.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01302"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> moved an Amendment to give a discretionary power to the local supervising authorities to make grants in aid of the maintenance of midwives. The noble Lord said: It seems to me that it is a necessary corollary of the legislation which is now established that there should be this discretionary power granted to county councils of making grants in aid of maintenance. I am aware that the idea is that voluntary nursing associations should provide the midwife, but there are parts of the country in which no nursing association exists. The people, then, are in this position. They are compelled by law to employ a certified midwife, and if there is no certified midwife in the district, because it is impossible in ninny cases for these women to make a living wage, they would have to do without one at all. There is no question that in many parts of the country it is almost impossible for a midwife to make a living. I have before me the report of the medical officer of health of my own district, which gives some very interesting figures on the subject. Of forty-two independent midwives practising in the county, four attended no cases and twenty-seven attended less than twenty-five cases each. As the fee in each case varies from 4<i>s</i>. to 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., it is very evident that it is not possible for these women to earn a living wage. As the law compels people to employ a certified midwife, it seems to be a necessary consequence that the Government should put it within their power to obtain the services of these trained women. Your Lordships will notice that the power is only discretionary, and it seems to me that it is one that can safely be entrusted to the county councils. I hope, therefore, the noble Earl will see his way to accept this Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01305"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I think that on reflection the noble Lord will see that his Amendment in putting a large burden on local taxation would probably be considered in another place to be a very serious breach of privilege. In addition to that, I hope your Lordships will not approve of this somewhat socialistic proposal of the noble Lord's, which becomes even stronger in the next Amendment on the Paper. The noble Lord suggests that the local supervising authority should aid the maintenance of midwives. I have no doubt the noble Lord would probably be one of the first to say that midwives stood in a different category from any other class; that doctors, for instance, were entirely different. But I think a great many noble Lords would not agree. They would say that in scattered districts, where it is difficult for doctors to live, it is just as necessary that the local authority should make grants in aid of doctors as it is that they should make grants in aid of midwives. It is difficult to make any sound distinction between the two if once you throw the cost upon the local authority. I venture to think that in any case this is a very great departure in principle from anything which has been done in this country, and in view of the large charge which it would make and the fact that it is without doubt a breach of privilege, I venture to hope the noble Lord will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01314"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> moved to substitute the local supervising authority of the county or county borough for the Poor-law guardians. The noble Lord said: I think your Lordships will recognise that this Amendment is one of very great importance. The Bill was before the House for some time and was withdrawn by the noble Earl the Lord President, and it was generally supposed that the object of withdrawing the Bill for a while was to amend
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0229"/>
<col>449</col>
this very Clause 17 in order to meet the large number of objections which had been raised. But to the great disappointment of all those interested in the Bill it returned to this House with the objectionable clause still standing in it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01315">The objection to the clause, of course, is that you are bringing possibly thousands of poor thrifty people within touch of the Poor-law authority, a thing which they dread and dislike more than anything else. The noble Earl has sought to remove these objections by inserting a new subsection which declares that the payment of these fees to the doctor is not to be regarded as parochial relief. It seems to me that the very effect of this provision is to remove any possible argument that there may have been for the system of making the payments through the Poor-law guardians. Either these payments are parochial relief or they are not. If they are parochial relief, surely you have no right to say in your Act that they are not parochial relief; hut if, on the other hand, the payments are not in the nature of Poor-law relief, why make it appear that they are so by employing the whole of the machinery of Poor-law relief? It is quite futile to declare by your Act that it is not to be so regarded. You cannot regulate people's sentiments by an Act of Parliament. His Majesty's Government are trying to do a great deal by legislation at the present time, but I venture to say that to regulate people's feelings by legislation is a thing they will never be able to accomplish.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01316">Surely the Government know what the feelings of the poor are in respect of this matter, and how utterly unlikely it is that their strong objection to being brought within touch of the Poor-law should be allayed by a declaration in an Act of Parliament that they are not to regard it as Poor-law relief. Just as well might you send a man to prison and tell him he is not to regard himself as in prison, but only for the time being as one of His Majesty's guests. I hold, therefore, that this new proviso, which is supposed to remove objections, is utterly ineffective for the purpose; but what I want to know is why the Government have gone out of their way to introduce the interference of a second local authority in this matter when there is no apparent reason for doing so. The county councils and the county borough councils are the authorities responsible for the administration of the Midwives Act, for
<col>450</col>
the supervision of midwives, and the regulation of everything that pertains to them. It would, therefore, seem to the ordinary person to be the obvious thing that the county councils or the county borough councils should make the payments which are necessary. After all, it is not a matter of obtaining the money from a different source. The money in either case comes out of the same pockets. There is a very good precedent too. It is the county councils who pay the doctor when the doctor is summoned by the police. It would, therefore, not be any innovation to continue that system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01317">But what is still more remarkable is that there is absolutely no authority which can be quoted for the proposal which His Majesty's Government have made in Clause 17. It is not a recommendation of the Departmental Committee. The proposals were not supported by any of the witnesses who appeared before that Committee, but, on the contrary, were objected to by an immense weight of authority and by a large number of public bodies who understand the question and are deeply concerned in it. I shall be interested to hear. on what grounds the noble Earl has thought it necessary to maintain these proposals in the Bill. I am in hopes that he has only done so in order that they may be discussed in your Lordships' House before an alteration is made. But, in any circumstance, I hope very much that it is the noble Earl's intention to modify the proposals and to allay the very great anxiety which exists at the present time as to the effect of these proposals, which I wish to impress upon your Lordships have the effect of bringing thousands of poor people whose most earnest effort and hope in life is to keep out of touch of Poor-law relief within the grip of the Poor-law guardians without their consent and without any application on their part; and, what is more, you are compelling them by law to make payments for which they have made no contract, for which they are entirely unprepared, and as to the amount of which they have no say.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01319"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should have thought that the proposal of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0230"/>
<col>451</col>
the noble Lord to vary the incidence and the area of the local charge by shifting it from the Poor-law union to the county was in itself a breach of privilege, for you cannot either increase or vary the incidence of a burden without conflicting with the rights of the House of Commons. The noble Lord told us that he was proposing what was frankly socialistic legislation, and he excused himself by saying that the idea had crept into previous legislation. I must say for myself that I should wish to withstand socialistic legislation whether the thin edge of the wedge had been got in already or not. The noble Lord said that it was impossible to change sentiment by law, but I think his speech shows that he recognises the effect of the law in that direction, because his whole argument was that the idea of getting aid from the Poor-law, even though they are not pauperised through it, is so repugnant that people would abstain from obtaining this relief. It is quite clear that the noble Lord contemplates a very large additional expenditure of public money on the rates as the result of his Amendment. Therefore he is not merely contemplating the shifting of a charge from one local body to another, but a large augmentation of that charge, because he spoke of the thousands and thousands of people who would benefit in one case, but who would refrain in the other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01320"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I do not propose any increase in the charge. I merely propose that the fees should be paid by one authority and not by another. That would not increase the amount of the charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01321"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Lord recognises the full bearing of his own remarks. He said that there were thousands and thousands of people who would shrink from getting relief from the Poor-law, but who would obtain this relief if they had another authority to appeal to. Therefore it is obvious that he does indicate that the effect of his Amendment would be to bring in a large amount of chargeability on public funds which under the Bill as it stands would not take place. We have too many proposals to give people the benefit of being paupers without any of the stigma. I am quite satisfied that the fact that people are ashamed of getting relief which is Poor-law relief does stimulate a great deal of self-reliance and thrift and
<col>452</col>
many other important virtues. We are having experience in regard to the question of providing meals for school children. That was merely a permissive power. Nevertheless local authorities are using it, and now we find attempts made to secure that children should also be fed on Saturdays and Sundays, and, indeed, all the year round, holidays as well as school time. If a parent is unable to maintain his own family, it is a proper case of destitution and for Poor-law relief, and in substance he is a pauper. I believe in a little hardness and sternness in these matters. By the sort of proposal contained in this Amendment a great deal is done to demoralise and debauch the people, and I therefore hope the Amendment will not be agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01322"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: I desire to say a few words in support of this Amendment. I am not in the least deterred because to do so lays one open to the charge of supporting socialistic legislation or brings one into conflict with the privilege of the other House of Parliament. It is surely straining words to say that this is a socialistic proposal because it proposes that the payment of the fee of the doctor who is called in on child-birth should be borne by the public health authority instead of by the Poor-law guardians.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01323"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord who moved the Amendment himself described his proposal as socialistic.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01324"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: I should protest against the description just as heartily. But I think my noble friend Lord Ampthill described the previous Amendment, which he did not press, as socialistic, not this one. I did not hear him say anything in moving this Amendment about its being a socialistic proposal. I desire to submit to your Lordships that this Amendment is of extreme importance, and that it has claims upon your Lordships' attention on its merits and quite apart from any label you may attach to it. The difficulty hitherto has been this, that in cases of child-birth a doctor has been called in and in a great many cases has been unable to obtain the fee for his attendance. As there has been no provision made hitherto for the payment of his fee, in some cases it has been provided by the Poor-law guardians and in some cases by the public health authority. The Departmental Committee recommend that an alteration to payment by the Poor-law
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0231"/>
<col>453</col>
guardians should be adopted, the Government have accepted their recommendation, and that course has been put into the Bill.<lb/>
I cannot help saying that this is just an instance&#x2014;a very important instance&#x2014;of legislating for people and at the same time ignoring altogether their own opinion on the subject. In another important controversy going on in the country at. the present moment we are told that it is unnecessary and undesirable that women should be given a vote at Parliamentary elections because Parliament always considers their interests and legislates for them adequately and generously. This is just an example of where the interests of the class affected by your legislation have been ignored from the outset. On the Departmental Committee there was no midwife and no representative of the class of poor women who will be affected by the Bill, and since the Bill appeared emphatic protests have been made against this clause. There have been protests from the midwives themselves, from the British Medical Association, from the Society of Medical Officers of Health, from the Royal British Nurses Association, from the Women's Co-operative Guild, from the Railway Women's Guild, from the Women's Labour League, and even from a certain number of boards of guardians.<lb/>
This particular clause in the Bill has met with the greatest possible opposition from the moment it appeared. It was opposed on the ground that it was imposing the stigma of pauperism on people whom you compel by Act of Parliament to summon medical aid in cases of child-birth, and it was largely in consequence of the opposition raised that this Bill was withdrawn, and in the present Bill something has been done to remove the stigma of pauperism. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Sheffield, wants to discourage people from availing themselves of this provision, and he hopes that the stigma of pauperism will act as a discouragement. The Government do not I desire anything of the kind, because they have provided in their amending Bill that the doctor's fee shall not be regarded as Poor-law relief. Although the board of guardians is still retained as the authority who will pay this fee, the Bill declares that the payment is not to be parochial relief. But it does not matter in the least what it is called if the whole subject is still to be dealt with by the Poor-law authority.<lb/>
<col>454</col>
The homes of these people are to be subjected to the inquisitorial visits of relieving officers, and the people themselves may have to appear before the Poor-law guardians and answer questions as to ability to pay the necessary fee.<lb/>
I hold that the whole object of this Bill will be defeated if this clause is retained. Hitherto there has been considerable reluctance on the part of midwives and patients to summon a doctor on these occasions, and that will at once spring up again if, by the machinery of this clause, as it stands in the Bill at present, it is realised that to summon a doctor in cases of child-birth involves the intervention of the relieving officer and appearing before the Poor-law guardians to answer their questions. This Amendment I feel to be absolutely necessary if the Bill is to serve the purpose the Government have in view, without inflicting at the same time fresh hardships on the class of poor women whom the Bill is intended to benefit. I therefore strongly support the Amendment of my noble friend, and sincerely hope that the noble Earl will accept it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01325"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Amendment which the noble Earl supports he tells us is absolutely necessary if the Bill is to carry out the objects with which it was introduced. I congratulate the noble Earl on his knowledge of what was in the minds of those who brought this Bill forward, but I can assure him that to carry this Amendment would mean that the Bill would go no further either in this House or in another place. It is true that the Bill has met with opposition in the Press, but it has been just as warmly supported as it has been somewhat ignorantly opposed in various newspapers. I am bound to say that in a considerable number of the comments dealing with this matter there is a most unfortunate assumption, which is wholly inaccurate, that the State lays upon people the absolute necessity of sending for a medical attendant. I am not anxious to labour the point, which has been raised by the noble Lord behind me, how far this Amendment really raises the matter of privilege.<lb/>
But let me point out to the noble Lord opposite how incomplete his Amendment is, at any rate in its present form. If this Amendment were accepted I suppose the noble Lord would himself suggest that
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0232"/>
<col>455</col>
some method of recovery was expedient. Let me point out to him that in the great majority of cases, at any rate outside the area of county boroughs, the local supervising authority has no means of making satisfactory inquiry into the circumstances of the patient. This would either reduce recovery to a dead letter, or else they would be forced to have recourse to the boards of guardians themselves for information and for help and advice as to whether they should proceed further in the matter or not. The noble Lord makes no provision apparently for the ultimate recovery of the fee, either from the patient herself or from her husband. If it was his intention that medical attention whenever necessary should be provided at the cost of the rates by the local supervising authority his recommendation goes a good deal further even that the Minority Report of the Poor-law Commission. The Commissioners who signed that Report definitely recommended systematic recovery from those responsible, if they are able to pay, according to their means.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01326"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl will allow me to interrupt him I might inform him that, although I have not put it on the Paper, I do propose an alteration of subsection (2) to provide for recovery.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01327"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: It is obviously inconvenient to your Lordships as well as myself to discuss Amendments that are not on the Paper, and, if the noble Lord will pardon me for saying so, I must continue, he not having given notice, as if that Amendment was not before your Lordships. I must further point out that you are dealing with the whole question of whether or not free medical assistance should be given to these people. You are really dealing with the whole question of the Poor-law. How are you going to deal with the Poor-law in future? It is an attempt, not on the part of the noble Lord himself but of his friends not in this House, to prejudge the question, and I am bound to say, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, that is a matter which we ought not to deal with on the present occasion. I am quite sure that there will he no attempt to shirk the issues which will be dealt with when the time comes to deal with them.<lb/>
On this occasion we are only dealing with an amendment of a particular Act,
<col>456</col>
and I venture to think it would be far more businesslike on the part of your Lordships on the present occasion not to prejudge the larger questions which must come before Parliament in due time, but to deal with the machinery such as it is and make the best of it, and in that way you will not only be more likely to get this Bill through Parliament but you will be dealing more fairly with Parliament itself. Even in the Minority Report of the Poor-law Commission they say it is very desirable that the adjudication should not be done by a local administrative body such as that to which the noble Lord refers these cases in his Amendment. In that Report they say&#x2014;
<quote>"The work of adjudicating upon particular cases&#x2014;of assessing how much each person should pay, or whether be should be excused on the ground of poverty&#x2014;appears to us no less unsuitable for a local administrative body than the general decision of whether or not the tax should-be levied at all."</quote>
And they conclude that&#x2014;
<quote>"The duty of determining what special assessments are due according to the law, and from whom, together with the decision whether the person liable is of sufficient ability to pay, and the duty of enforcing payment by proper legal process, ought to be entirely separated from the work of administering the public assistance."</quote>
If your Lordships look for a moment at Clause 17 you will see that the objections which have been advanced against the board of guardians as the paying authority are to a considerable extent without any real foundation. Subsection (5) expressly declares that the payment of fees by boards of guardians is not to be considered as parochial relief, alms, or charitable allowance to any person, and no person by reason thereof is to be subjected to any disadvantage; and under subsection (4) the Local Government Board may make regulations in respect to the manner in which boards of guardians are to carry out their powers and duties under the section. I venture to think that under these regulations the Local Government Board will be able to make it perfectly clear that none of that inquisitorial investigation which the noble Lord fears will be likely to take place.<lb/>
Let me point out how very unsuitable these local supervising authorities really are to carry out the duty of investigation. Here you have the local medical man summoned, and it is in our opinion obvious
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0233"/>
<col>457</col>
that the near local authority is the proper authority to investigate the circumstances of the parents. Very often probably no investigation will be necessary. But let me take the noble Lord's own county of Bedfordshire. How can the county council sitting in the capital of that county know accurately the circumstances of every cottager throughout: the whole of the county? They have no machinery for doing it, and I think it is perfectly obvious, for the present at any rate, that so long as boards of guardians exist&#x2014;and it may not be for ever&#x2014;they are the most convenient authorities for dealing with this question.. But, in any case, I venture to hope your Lordships will not agree with this Amendment if only on this one single, but I think very important, issue&#x2014;that we do not wish in this Bill to deal with or to prejudge the questions of Poor-law reform. We have the Act of 1902, which has effected a great deal of good throughout the country, and has saved a great many lives. Here in this Bill we see opportunities of amending that Act and making it still more useful, and I should very much regret if this comparatively humble little Bill were to be used as the battle ground of the contending armies of Poor-law reformers. Our object is to use the existing material, to amend the Bill on the lines which have already done so much good, and it is upon those grounds that I venture to hope your Lordships will agree to pass it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01328"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that if anything would encourage me to vote for this Amendment it would be the attack made upon it by Lord Sheffield on the ground of privilege. My Lords, where are we coming to on this question of privilege? We are told that if we alter the incidence of a charge in this Bill we shall be infringing upon the privilege of the House of Commons. The House of Commons has never seen this Bill. This is a Bill which has been introduced in the House of Lords, and we are absolutely ignorant of the opinion of the House of Commons on the point. If we are to be debarred from altering a charge in a Bill brought in by the Government, which the House of Commons have never seen, and to be told that we are infringing the privilege of the House of Commons simply because we are acting contrary to the wishes of the Government, then I say we are reaching a pitch with regard to this
<col>458</col>
question of privilege which even noble Lords opposite have never attempted to maintain before. We are at last beginning to realise that these questions of privilege really mean opposition to the wishes of the Government, and I venture to think that is a thing which your Lordships will remember on future occasions.<lb/>
In my view this Amendment in no way touches the privileges of the House of Commons. It is an Amendment which must be considered on its merits, and I confess that if I came down here this afternoon prejudiced at all it was in favour of all the Amendments of my noble friend behind me and in advance against any opposition that I thought the Government might make. But, my Lords, I confess I have been converted by the debate that has taken place and by the speeches which the noble Earl representing the Government and the noble Lord behind him have made. It does seem to me that if we accept this Amendment we are deciding offhand a very important question which will have to be decided probably in the near future, but which should be decided in connection with the whole question of the reform of the Poor-law, and I think it would be very unfortunate if we were to prejudge that discussion in any shape or form. The position, as it seems to me, is this. This is a small point, and for the moment the responsible authority, the Government, advise us that it is better to let sleeping dogs lie and to continue on the lines laid down in the Bill. They have supported that position by very powerful arguments, and at the same time have not prejudiced one side or the other in the discussion which will arise in any consideration in future of the reform of the Poor-law. I certainly therefore will have no hesitation in voting with the. Government against this Amendment if my noble friend behind me proceeds to a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01329"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do hope your Lordships will not be led away by the specious but exceedingly able argument which has been put forward by the noble Earl. I do protest against the notion that this is in any way prejudging the question of Poor-law reform. I cannot imagine anything more far-fetched than the use of that argument in this connection. This is not a question of free medical attendance for the poor. If your Lordships look at the Bill you will see exactly what
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0234"/>
<col>459</col>
it is. These poor people do not ask for the attendance of the doctor. They do not want the attendance of the doctor. The doctor is forced upon them by the local authority for the protection of the midwife.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01330"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Lord's pardon. Will he kindly substantiate and give us the authority for his statement that this medical relief is forced upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01331"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: The regulations of the Central Midwives Board, which oblige the midwife in certain circumstances to send for a doctor whether the patient or the husband desires it or not. That is the position, as I understand it. Therefore it is not a question of free medical attendance. Neither the patient nor the husband has any choice whatever in the matter. I have some personal experience of these things as I happen to be chairman of the midwives committee in my county. I am constantly, therefore, in touch with actual cases of this kind, and great though the noble Earl's experience is, I do not think he has had the same experience of the matter in detail as I have. The doctor is sent for, not in order to confer a benefit on the poor people, not to give them free medical attendance, but for the protection of the midwife, and the midwife is supervised and controlled by regulations for the general protection of the public.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl went on to say that the local supervising authority had no means of making the necessary inquiries. There, again, I think he is lacking in actual experience. The county council has its midwives executive committee. They have their local medical officer of health. In every district there are the medical officers of health, and counties have an inspector of midwives, who goes round and visits every one of these cases and is in an excellent position to find out the exact circumstances. Next, the noble Earl said that this Bill was continuing on existing lines. There, again, I am afraid I must join issue with him. There are no existing lines in this respect. These fees have been paid in some cases by the local supervising authority and in other cases by the Poor-law guardians. To say that the Bill is continuing on existing lines is to show an entire misapprehension of the facts. You have to choose between the local supervising authority
<col>460</col>
and the Poor-law guardians, and it seems to me to be the more obvious and commonsense method to choose the authority which has the duty of administering the Act and of supervising the midwives, and which is, therefore, in the best position to know the circumstances and to adjudicate in each case. I do not want to take up your Lordships' time, and therefore I refrain from replying further; but I must say the noble Earl set up a purely imaginary version of what I said in order to make fun of it. The noble Earl misrepresented my remarks in the most extraordinary manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01332"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Lord founded so much of his argument upon the supposed necessity to send for the doctor I think I ought to correct that at once. There is no such necessity, and if the noble Lord will turn to the regulations of the Central Midwives Board be will find that is so. There is no obligation on the midwife or on the patient or on the parents of the patient to do so. The midwife only advises. That being so, most of the noble Lord's argument falls to the ground.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01340"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have hardly anything to say in commending this Bill on Second Reading to your Lordships' attention, but as I hope we may have more Bills of this kind, perhaps you will excuse me for two or three minutes in briefly explaining what it is. There have been for many, many years complaints about the inextricable confusion of the Statutes relating to licensing, which has
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0235"/>
<col>461</col>
been a source of trouble to the oldest practitioners at the Bar, and attempts have been made by the Government to put matters right. In this instance the Bill was brought in by a private Member for the purpose of consolidating the law relating to licensing. It was supported both by those who represent the temperance reformers and by those who represent the licensed trade. The Bill passed its Second Reading in the House of Commons and was then referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses. The Joint Committee did me the honour of electing me as their Chairman, and we bad some five or six afternoons on this Bill. We have put it into shape and suggested certain Amendments, only one of which is a change in the law. I am glad to say that all the recommendations we put forward passed through the House of Commons and were accepted. I am also happy to say that there was not a solitary difference of opinion on any one of the questions before that Committee. The only change which has been made in the law is this, that whereas before it was doubtful whether a licence being granted to a house which at any previous time had a licence was to be treated as a renewal or not, we propose that it should be treated as a renewal if the house has been licensed within a twelvemonth. I hope that your Lordships will give your consent to this Bill, and that its success may encourage other private Members to do the same good work which has been done by a private Member on this occasion &#x2014;namely, to put the tangle of our Statutes into something like ordinary shape, and thereby enable people to understand what the law is.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BRITISH INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01363"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> rose to call attention to the present position of the question of British Indians in South Africa; and to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. How many Indians have been deported from South Africa.</li>
<li>2. Whether he still maintains that none of those deported were domiciled in South Africa.</li>
<li>3. Whether it is not a fact that about a third of those deported are of South African birth.</li>
<li>4. What is the precise nature of the arrangement made by the Transvaal Government with the Portuguese authorities at Mozambique for carrying out these deportations.</li>
<li>5. Whether it is not unprecedented in the annals of the Empire that British subjects should be handed over for punishment to a Foreign Government.</li>
<li>6. Whether the punishment of transportation is not as obsolete in British law as those of the pillory and the stocks.</li>
<li>7. Whether the speech made by the Governor-General of the Dominion of South Africa at Johannesburg on the 8th July may be taken to indicate that His Majesty's Government have adopted a more decided policy in regard to their Imperial obligations towards His Majesty's Indian subjects; and to move for Papers.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01364">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have not troubled your Lordships with the question of the British Indians in the Transvaal since November last. I understand that the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is obliged to be absent now, has been good enough, rather than postpone the Questions, to entrust the answers to my noble friend opposite, the Lord President of the Council. The reason why I have not troubled your Lordships or the noble Earl with Questions during this long period is that I had sincerely hoped that the negotiations with the Transvaal Ministers which were begun about this time last year would have borne fruit, and would have resulted ere this in some satisfactory settlement of this deplorable question. But so far from there being any signs of settlement at
<col>464</col>
the present time, matters have gone from bad to worse, and I should feel ashamed of myself if I kept silence any longer. I must let your Lordships know what is going on, for the unfortunate difficulty in this matter is that it seems impossible to get either House of Parliament, or the Press, or the public to take any interest in a matter which is really one of vital Imperial importance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01365">The ex-President of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt, when speaking at the Guildhall on May 31, made a remark which struck me as singularly true and appropriate. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"You are so very busy at home that I am not sure you realise just how things are, in some places at least, abroad."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01366">My Lords, that is absolutely true of this question, and I feel that not only should I be lacking in duty, knowing the facts as I do, if I refrained from pressing them upon your Lordships on every possible occasion, but also that no excuse is necessary for trying to bring home both to Parliament and to the people of this country the very great risk which they are running if this matter is not going to be settled. Now what is going on at the present time? The Indians who have been contending so bravely all these years and with such devotion and self-sacrifice, not for any personal or political privileges or rights but for the honour of their race, are now being deported from the country. They are being tricked out of the Transvaal by administrative action, and in a manner which allows them no appeal to the Courts of law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01367">The process, as I understand it, is this. These Indian gentlemen are asked whether they have registered. They reply that they have. The next question is, "Where is your certificate?" The answer is, "I have destroyed my certificate as a protest against the action of the Government when they failed to carry out the promise which we believe they made." Thereupon they are put into the train and carried across the border. As soon as they are across the border of the Transvaal they are told that they are at liberty, but that is only a way of speaking, for while the train is going at forty miles an hour, it is obviously impossible for them to alight and take advantage of the liberty which is said to be given to them. Thus they are conveyed to Delagoa Bay, and
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0237"/>
<col>465</col>
there the Portuguese authorities arrest them as undesirable aliens and put them on board ship and send them off to India. I imagine&#x2014;and this is one of the points that I want information upon&#x2014;that the Transvaal Government pay the bill of the Portuguese Government for doing this dirty work. When these unfortunate men arrive in India they are met by friends and sympathisers who have been collecting funds all over India in order to relieve the suffering of their fellow-country-men in the. Transvaal and who arrange to have them shipped back again. When they arrive back they are forbidden to land, and the shipping companies are, of course, placed in great difficulty. Your Lordships will see that this process of shipping these men backwards and forwards between South Africa and India cannot go on indefinitely.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01368">I believe&#x2014;and here again is a point on which I want positive official information for the public&#x2014;that altogether nearly 300 of these people have been deported since this policy was instituted about a year ago. Certainly within the last two months something like 120 or 130 have been so shipped off to India, and of this last lot all were domiciled and identified; that is to say, all of them had their homes in South Africa and had voluntarily registered themselves. When in November last I asked the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether any of those who had been deported were South African born, he said lie thought that none or them were, and lie said it in a manner Which implied that if any of them were domiciled in South Africa lie would take a very different view of the question, and that it would be a matter which would demand instant and vigorous protest from himself. But the fact which I think is now established beyond doubt is that one-third of these people are actually South African born, and it follows that many of them have never seen India. South Africa is their home. They have never been anywhere else, and when they arrive in India they are naturally completely at a loss what to do. What makes matters worse is that their wives and families are left behind in South Africa, and your Lordships can well imagine what the privations and sufferings of these poor people must be.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01369">I want your Lordships particularly to "note the effect of all this in India. We
<col>466</col>
learn very little about it from the newspapers, because, for reasons which I have been unable to fathom, the subject is one which is not favoured by the Press of this country. But I know, as a matter of fact, that nothing is creating greater discontent or stronger resentment among those in India than the treatment of their fellow-countrymen in South Africa at the present time. At the meeting of the Indian National Congress held at Lahore in January there was only one point which gave occasion for a general demonstration of feeling, and that was when Mr. Bownaghee appealed for funds for their fellow-sufferers in the Transvaal. That was the one appeal at that Congress which met with a sympathetic and really feeling response. Now, my Lords, will any one maintain I hat this is not a genuine grievance, or that it is not a grievance for which we as a nation have to reproach ourselves? The people of India regard the Queen's Proclamation as the great Charter of their rights and their privileges, and it is to that that they are constantly referring, and when they say in this matter&#x2014;
<quote>"Our rulers and Ministers and Governors have departed from the letter and spirit of the Queen's Proclamation,"</quote>
I, for one, should be unable to deny that that was the case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01370">But there have been more definite and more explicit promises made actually in reference to these grievances, and I hold that a promise is a promise and must be kept. If our promises, made through the mouths of responsible Ministers, are not kept, surely we must expect that our credit and our reputation for honour and justice must suffer in India. Besides the general declarations of Statesmen of both Parties in this country and of Statesmen in South Africa, there was Lord Milner's very definite assurance given to the Indians in the Transvaal in 1903 when he assured them that once they registered themselves their domicile was established and no further registration would be necessary, and that that registration gave them the right to be there and the right to come and go. I have repeated over and over again in this House that that promise, which nobody can deny was made, has not been kept. This question is no fad of mine, although, unfortunately, I cannot get any one else to take it up and support me in it. I should like to remind your
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0238"/>
<col>467</col>
Lordships of what has been said by some of the leading men in this country. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition himself said, as far back as 1899&#x2014;
<quote>"A considerable number of the Queen's Indian subjects are to be found in the Transvaal, and among the many misdeeds of the South African Republic I do not know that any fills me with more indignation than its treatment of those Indians. The harm is not confined to the sufferers on the spot, for what do you imagine would be the effect produced in India when these poor people return to their country to report to their friends that the Government of the Queen Empress, so mighty and irresistible in India with its population of 300,000,000, is powerless to secure redress at the hands of a small South African State."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01371">My Lords, that referred to the grievance of the Indians at the time of the South African Republic. But that statement applies with even greater force at the present time. If it should have been a matter of surprise and resentment to the people of India that the Government of the Queen-Empress could not secure such redress at the hands of a small South African State, how much more must they feel it when the Government cannot secure redress for them at the hands of what is now a British Colony?</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01372">There is not only Lord Lansdowne's fear of these people returning to India and spreading indignation in the country. I could quote Mr. Lyttelton and Lord Selborne. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, put it to us whether it was not our duty to see that our dusky fellow-subjects in the Transvaal, where they had a perfect right to go, should be treated as the Queen in our name had promised that they should be treated. Recently there has been a declaration on the part of the new Governor-General of South Africa. Lord Gladstone, at Johannesburg a short time ago, said he recognised that the Mahomedan and British Indians had claims on his attention, and he could not forget His Majesty's Imperial responsibility or ignore his own. Yes, but why has the duty arising out of these Imperial responsibilities not been discharged during the past ten years? Surely we have had enough of brave words on this subject without corresponding action. As I have said over and over again in this House, there have been many opportunities for settling this question. I fully admit that the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies found this question infinitely more difficult of solution when he came into office. The opportunity of
<col>468</col>
the Transvaal loan, and other occasions, had been lost. But the noble Earl, too, has had his opportunities. He had a great opportunity last summer when the Transvaal Ministers were here on the business of the South African Constitution, when he was able to talk the matter over with them face to face, and I must say I am intensely disappointed that nothing has thus far come out of that opportunity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01373">I cannot help feeling that in this matter, as in other matters, it is a case of where there is a will there is a way. I quite admit that the noble Earl has secured a certain improvement in small matters. The British Indians at the present time are better treated on the railways, and their treatment in the gaols has certainly been improved. But those are not the real grievances. The real grievance is that arising on the point of honour, the grievance which results from the insulting and humiliating manner in which the policy of restricting Indian immigration is carried out. The restriction of immigration is necessary and justifiable. I have admitted that over and over again, and so have the British Indian community in the Transvaal. But what is not necessary and not justifiable&#x2014;and I defy any one to say that it is&#x2014;is that the Indians should, for the purposes of this policy, be classed as criminals and that we as a nation should be dishonoured and discredited in India by the action of a Colonial Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01374">This is a big Imperial question. <i>The Times</i> remarked a short time ago that there was no truly Imperial question of greater complexity, and at the same time of more vital urgency. I quote <i>The Times</i> because when I have said in this House that this is an Imperial question which is both urgent and vital and which is going to produce difficulties far greater than any of us can foresee it has only provoked a smile, but the time will come, I feel certain, when circumstances will arouse the British public to a sense of the harm that is being done, and when they will demand full information on the subject and require to know why these grievances have remained unredressed and why this deplorable state of affairs has been allowed to continue all these years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01375"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend the Secretary of State for
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0239"/>
<col>469</col>
the Colonies is unfortunately unable to be present this evening, and I desire on his behalf to express his regret for his absence, which I am sure I. regret as much as any noble Lord, because naturally he has a much more intimate knowledge of this subject than I can possibly have. I will endeavour to answer the Questions of which the noble Lord has given notice, but I am sure he will recognise that it is impossible for me to answer any of those various points he has mentioned but of which he has given no notice.<lb/>
To the first Question, as to the number of Indians deported from South Africa, the answer is 257 since March 11, when the deportations commenced. In the last three months the numbers are&#x2014; May, 39; June, 11; July, 4. The noble Lord next asks whether it is still maintained that no Indian domiciled in South Africa has been deported. It is stated by the Union Government that every opportunity was afforded to individuals of proving their domicile, but all failed to do so. In many instances persons ordered to be deported refused absolutely to give any information, while some stated that they desired to co to India. Whenever it appeared that a person had been resident or born in any other part of South Africa, lie was returned thither. In every case where a person to be removed claimed to have a wife and family, he was allowed facilities to take them with him at the public expense, but only in one instance was this taken advantage of.<lb/>
Next the noble Lord asks whether about a third of those deported are not of South African birth. Particulars of all these cases are not available. Particulars of sixty-nine cases have been submitted to the Colonial Office, and fifty-six of these have been reported on by Ministers through the Governor-General. It is stated as an illustration of the difficulty of dealing with the question that no trace can be found of twenty-three of the names given. Twenty-five of the fifty-six were stated to have been born in South Africa, and it is reported by the Union Government that eleven of these twenty-five cannot be traced, that twelve of them refused to give any means of identification, ten stating that they did not claim South African domicile. The same statement was made by six of the others in the list who were not alleged to have been born in South
<col>470</col>
Africa. In only one case outside the lists is there independent evidence in the Colonial Office records tending to establish domicile in Natal, and in that case the man was removed to Natal and not to India.<lb/>
In reply to Question 4, I have to say that the operative document in this matter is a by-law of the township of Lorenzo Marquez, issued on July 15, 1909, which is as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"All Asiatics entering the district by land, no matter from whence they have come, who are not provided with official documents authorising them to reside in the district or in the neighbouring colonies shall he obliged to leave this port by the first boat immediately after their entry into the township."</quote>
The noble Lord asks whether it is not unprecedented that British subjects should be handed over for punishment to a foreign Government. Might I, in the first place, say that I am not quite sure that I agree with the noble Lord in his use of the word "punishment." The actual fact is that under the Transvaal laws these Indians are put over the border of the Transvaal province and are then dealt with under the laws either of other provinces of the Union or of Mozambique. The position of Mozambique <i>vis &#x00E8; vis</i> the Transvaal is without precedent, as it contains, though a foreign country, a port&#x2014;namely, Lorenzo Marquez&#x2014;which is becoming to an ever increasing extent the port of the Transvaal. So long as Portuguese legislation is not differential and applies to all Asiatics alike, it is difficult for His Majesty's Government to protest.<lb/>
As to Question 6, "transportation" is, think, in this connection something of an attempt to raise prejudice, and the question of British law hardly affects the case. The deportation of persons who are held to be undesirables by reason of transgression of the laws or otherwise is a recognised part of the Colonial law, not only in South Africa, but in other parts of the British Empire&#x2014;Canada, for instance. With regard to Lord Gladstone's speech and the policy of His Majesty's Government, I have to say that His Majesty's Government have always recognised the gravity of the situation, and have steadily and continuously tried to find a solution. They have brought all allegations of the ill-treatment of prisoners immediately to the notice of the Transvaal and Union Governments. Endeavours to effect a.
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0240"/>
<col>471</col>
settlement were made when the Transvaal Ministers were in England in connection with the Union Act. Almost as soon as the Union was inaugurated the Governor-general was requested to urge on his Ministers that a happier commencement could not be made than by arranging a settlement acceptable to all parties. The present position is that the Union Government are carefully considering the question of policy in respect of Indians lawfully resident, though they cannot agree to unrestricted immigration, and hold themselves bound to enforce the law in every case where Indians not resident with proper authority endeavour to enter or reside. As to the publication of Papers, Papers will be laid if the Union Government agree, and they will be pressed by His Majesty's Government to agree. I think that covers all the points which have been raised by the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01376"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only rise to say a word on behalf of those who sit on this Bench, because my noble friend behind me has a little assumed that he speaks alone in this House, and he regretted that he had almost a monopoly of feeling on this subject. I cannot allow that to pass on behalf of my noble friend who is not present, Lord Lansdowne, because he has spoken himself with great sympathy and feeling on this subject in previous debates. My noble friend addressed a very eloquent appeal to the House, but he stopped short of the point of telling His Majesty's Government, what it was exactly that he would desire them to do, and what course he would recommend them to take. I think he must recognise that this is a subject of very great difficulty for any Government, especially having regard to the present situation in South Africa.<lb/>
I do not rise to do more than press this Upon the Government, that the whole of the Papers which have been published are very uncomfortable reading to many of us, and I should think probably to the Government themselves. We cannot help feeling that there is force in what has been urged by my noble friend behind me that an opportunity of obtaining some permanent assurances on this question was lost, at the time the Union was granted, as also at the time when the very large sum of thirty millions for which the Transvaal was indebted was remitted, and a further
<col>472</col>
loan of five millions was granted to them. I think that that would have been an opportunity to bring before the Government of the Transvaal the very serious feeling there is with regard to these Indian subjects of the Crown, and to press upon them that some regulation which would prevent these undoubted cases of hardship should be adopted.<lb/>
I know that it is at this moment almost impossible for His Majesty's Government to give any pledge except that which the noble Earl has given on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. But I am sure my noble friend will remember that in the case of these questions of races of different colour the difficulty is not confined to South Africa. Questions have arisen in other Colonies and in other Dominions of the Crown, where a position has been taken up by the local Government as to which His Majesty's Government may not find themselves altogether in accord. But if they have not taken steps in those cases, as in this, it may, I think, be reckoned that there is no question of want of sympathy, but that any attempt to impose on a people to whom you have given free institutions any law or regulations of this character might, and probably would, be deeply resented. From the office which I had the honour to hold I personally had the opportunity of becoming specially aware of these questions which the noble Lord has so admirably voiced in this House with regard to the feeling which exists in India, and I do hope that His Majesty's Government will go as far as they reasonably can to secure to the full extent the observance of the pledges which have been given in the past, and that they will take care that what. I think my noble friend is right in saying may become a dangerous state of feeling in India should not be accentuated by any apparent remissness on the part of His Majesty's Government. I do not wish to detain your Lordships further, but I hope it will be clearly understood that if we do not speak in any more vehement fashion on this subject it is only because we do not want to make more embarrassing an already very difficult situation, and that it is from no want of sympathy with those who have suffered an undoubted hardship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01377"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I hope your Lordships will allow me to say two or three words in reply. In the first place, I want
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0241"/>
<col>473</col>
to correct a slight misapprehension on the part of the noble Viscount who has just spoken. The last thing I had in my mind was to make any complaint that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition had not taken an interest in this question. I may say that he is the only member of your Lordships' House who has taken notice of it. What I complain of is that there is not a much more general interest taken in this question, such as, for instance, is taken in the management of the island of Vatersay. The noble Viscount reproached me for not suggesting a solution of the difficulty. It was not my province on this occasion to do that. I was merely asking for information in order to ascertain what the present position of affairs was. I have on many occasions had the privilege of acting as negotiator between those interested in the case of the Indians and His Majesty's Government, and I have made suggestions; and if there were occasion, and I had the opportunity, I should be able to make other suggestions again for settling this matter finally.<lb/>
The noble Lord said that it was a hopeless difficulty to try and settle this matter, because we should cause resentment in the Colony. If that be a sound argument it follows that we may allow not only any Colony but any foreign nation to inflict a vital injury on us without our being able to do any thing to defend ourselves, or to prevent an injury, for fear of raising resentment. That surely is a view which your Lordships cannot accept. With regard to the answers which the noble Earl was good enough to give me, I only want to make this remark. The Transvaal Government apparently have reported that those who were deported have failed to prove, or refused to prove, their identity. That is one way of putting the case. But what actually happens is this. All these men are registered. The Transvaal Government know exactly who they are. They have got all the particulars on record, so that it is a mere pretence to say that they are not identified, and that they do not know who they are. The Transvaal Government say they do not know who they are, and therefore they must turn them out of the country. The Indians say, "You have got us registered, and you know perfectly well who we are, and therefore it is unnecessary for us to produce these certificates"; and the certificates they do not produce because they
<col>474</col>
have burnt them as a protest against what they regard, rightly or wrongly, as the violation of a promise on behalf of the Transvaal Government. I thank the noble Earl for his courtesy in replying to my-Questions.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PRIVATE BILLS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01409"><member>THE ACTING CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH)</member><membercontribution>:Your Lordships will recollect that yesterday I asked the House to make a considerable number of alterations in the Standing Orders. They were all of a formal character and quite non-contentious. The proposed additional Order which is on the Paper today was also on the Paper yesterday, but it was intimated to me that there would be objection to it, and I thought it would be more convenient to the House that those Amendments which were non-contentious should be passed first, so that a clear and simple issue should be presented to the House with regard to this Order. The clause refers only to the metropolis, and only to traffic questions in the metropolis itself. The whole class of questions affecting regulation of traffic are obviously of great importance, and I am afraid they are not becoming any less complicated than they were before. Your Lordships know that the Commissioner of Police is
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0244"/>
<col>479</col>
the authority entrusted with the regulation of traffic in the metropolis, and it has been the practice for the last six or seven years for the Commissioner of Police to go thoroughly into all proposals which might cause obstruction of traffic or make the regulation of traffic more difficult, such as, for instance, the placing of tramways in, comparatively speaking, narrow streets. Reports are made by the Commissioner of Police to the Home Office, and the Home Office either takes action or not according to its discretion. But the Commissioner of Police in the past has only discharged this task under circumstances of great disadvantage and loss of time. He has no means of official knowledge soon enough with regard to proposals that are being made. In other words, he cannot know what is proposed until after the Home Office has become in possession of the Bills which are deposited, and that is practically not until the last days of the year. Thus much valuable time is lost, and the end of February or March is reached before the Commissioner of Police can make his report and the Home Office can take action upon it for the information of Parliament. I believe that the proposal which is made in this Standing Order would be not only to the advantage of the Commissioner of Police, but also to the advantage of the promoters of all this class of Bills. It is obviously for their advantage that they should know as soon as possible if any objection is to be taken to their proposals, because it is inconvenient for them to be objected to on this class of point after the Bill has been actually sent to a Committee. It may have to be considered by the Committee, but it would be much more convenient that the Committees and the Officers of the House should know of the objections at an early date. There is no intention to make the Commissioner of Police in any way an autocrat in these matters. No new duties are put upon him. He has this duty to discharge now. The only effect of this proposal is to enable him to discharge the duty earlier and with more satisfaction to himself and others than at the present time. The initiative in regard to this proposed Standing Order did not come from me. It was left as a legacy by the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees, but I have carefully looked into the matter. My judgment coincides with that of Lord Onslow, and I recommend the change to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<col>480</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01410"><i>Moved</i> to resolve, That the following new Standing Order be made&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01411">30A. Where by any Bill the construction of a work of any kind is proposed to be authorised by which street traffic or the regulation of street traffic in the Metropolitan Police District may be affected, a copy of so much of the plans and sections required to be deposited in the office of the Clerk of the Parliaments as relates to such work shall be deposited at the office of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis on or before the thirtieth' day of November immediately preceding the application for the Bill.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01412"><member>VISCOUNT HILL,</member> on behalf of Lord DUNMORE, moved an Amendment substituting the Traffic Branch of the Board of Trade for the Commissioner of Police. The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I have been asked to move the Amendment which stands in the name of my noble friend. The noble Lord, in moving the addition of this Standing Order, spoke of the position of the Police at the present moment, and of their not receiving sufficiently early notice of proposed improvements. That may be so. I do not doubt it. Neither do I wish to say that the Police have not up to the present time carried out the work of regulating the traffic satisfactorily. But me rather object to the Police having full control of the traffic, although we agree that they should be consulted. His Majesty's Government already have. a Traffic Branch under the Board of Trade, and the London County Council are of opinion that that is the proper authority to govern the widening and alteration of the streets, although the Police are very well capable of regulating the traffic when those widenings have taken place. This proposal seems to us to be entirely contrary to the recommendations of Royal Commissions on this subject. It has always been recommended that an independent tribunal should be appointed for the traffic of London. As I have said, there is a Traffic Branch in connection with the Board of Trade, and we consider that that is the proper authority to deal with this matter. There has been considerable difficulty in the past with the Commissioner of Police in regard to street widening, and so forth. I am not going into the particulars or into the figures now, but what the Commissioner of Police suggested to the London County Council
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0245"/>
<col>481</col>
with regard to certain streets would, if carried out, have involved an enormous expense to the ratepayers of London. The Commissioner's requirements were unreasonable in many instances, and we consider that these questions should be dealt with by an expert who is better informed and has much more experience than the Commissioner of Police. I believe every one is agreed that the traffic of London should be under an independent tribunal.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01414"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise on behalf of the Home Office to express the hope that this Amendment will not be carried. The Standing Order in the form in which it is upon the Paper conies, I think, with special authority, being, as the noble Lord the temporary Lord Chairman said just now, moved by himself after an independent investigation into the circumstances, as a result of which he was able to express the opinion that the Notion originally proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, was one which ought to be adopted by this House. It comes to. your Lordships, therefore, with a double measure of authority. The main object of it is to enable the Police, who advise the Secretary of State on street traffic questions, to prepare their observations at an early date, and it is thought that the earlier they can do so the more convenient it will be for the Committees and also for the promoters, whoever they might be, even in the case where the promoters are the London County Council themselves. In any ease the Home Office would very much desire that the Amendment should not be carried. Perhaps I might appeal on a question like this to those members in your Lordships' House who lately sat upon a Tramways Bill which was promoted by the London County Council. I think the noble Lord whom I see on the Back Bench opposite, Lord Clinton, was one of the members of that Committee. I understand that information was laid before that Committee by the Police and by the Home Office showing that reports of this character deal with intricate and important questions affecting street traffic. This matter has been well done in the past by
<col>482</col>
the Police, and we believe that this proposal will facilitate the work of the Police.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01415"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think my noble friend behind me has called in question the proposal made on behalf of the Lord Chairman that earlier notice should be given of any works which might cause interference with traffic. That is not the point in my noble friend's Amendment. The point which he desires to raise is that the proper department of the Government which ought to be put in motion is not. the Police, and through them the Home Office, but the Traffic Branch of the Board of Trade. I do not want to express any confident opinion on the point, but any of your Lordships who listened to the noble Earl the Lord President in the remarks he has just delivered must be aware that he did not address himself to that issue in the least. The noble Earl has been lately himself honourably connected with the Home Office, and he probably speaks with great knowledge of that Department but with less knowledge of the Board of Trade. I must say that in dealing with an Amendment of this kind his observations, always entitled to weight, would have been entitled to more weight if he had addressed himself to the point of the Amendment. There is a Traffic Branch of the Board of Trade. Why is that Traffic Branch not to be used? When I had the honour of being connected with the Board of Trade, as your Lordships know, we bad it in contemplation to pass a Bill for the traffic of London which was to have involved the creation of a great traffic authority&#x2014;I do not say entirely subservient to the Board of Trade; far from it&#x2014;but taking its initiative from the Board of Trade, although, of course, with the co-operation of the Home Office and the Local Government Board, the other Departments concerned. Though I should not for a moment desire to place any authority which I possess against; the authority of His Majesty's present advisers, I think it would have been more satisfactory to your Lordships if the noble Earl had been able to tell us why the Home Office are selected rather than the Board of Trade in this instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01416"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am quite ready, with the permission of your Lordships, to give the noble Marquess that information. It is because the work has been done so satisfactorily by the Home

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01436"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill to confirm a Provisional Order made under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1868, as read with other Acts, relating to an oyster and mussel fishery at the Bay of Firth, off the coast of Orkney. The purpose of the Order is to develop an oyster fishery at the place referred to. The Order is in similar terms to one which was scheduled to a Bill introduced in another place in 1908, but not proceeded with in that session. Further inquiry has been made recently with a view of ascertaining whether there has been any change since that year in the local circumstances which would render it inexpedient to proceed with the matter, and I have satisfied myself that there has been no such change. Your Lordships will see the bearing of the several clauses. I may, perhaps, be allowed to say that it is proposed at a subsequent stage of the Bill to restrict the operation of the Order to a period somewhat shorter than the term of sixty years mentioned in Clause 10 of the Schedule, and if the Bill is read a second time I propose to put down certain Amendments for this purpose.

<title>ST. MAGNUS CATHEDRAL, KIRKWALL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01439"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH,</member> on behalf of Lord A VEBURY, rose to ask the Secretary for Scotland whether it is the case that alterations are proposed to be made. on St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall; and, if so, what is the nature and extent of the alterations contemplated; in whom is the Cathedral vested, and who are responsible for its up-keep; what is the present condition of the fabric; what is the amount of money proposed to be expended on the alterations, how is it being provided, arid under what architect's advice is action being taken; further, to ask, in view of the great architectural and historical interest which attaches to the Cathedral, what are the powers of the Government in regard to it, and what
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0247"/>
<col>485</col>
are they willing to do in the matter. The noble Lord said: I have received a request from Lord Avebury, who is not able to be here to-day, to put this Question on his behalf, which I am glad to do. I think it is probably for the convenience of everybody concerned that the Question should he put and answered now, rather than postponed. I understand that the Secretary for Scotland agrees with that, and prefers to answer the Question now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01440"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged to my noble friend for putting the Question. The answer to the first paragraph is in the affirmative. The nature and extent of the alterations contemplated cannot he stated, as those who are responsible for the plans have not communicated them to His Majesty's Government. The Cathedral is vested in the town council, and they and the heritors are responsible for its upkeep. So far as I am aware the present condition of the fabric is good, and while the removal of certain galleries, screens, &amp;c., which have been erected in modern times, would be an improvement, I am advised that it is considered that there is no need for restoration. The amount of money proposed to he expended now on the alterations is, so far as His Majesty's Government can learn, &#x00A3;30,000, or possibly more, of a sum of &#x00A3;60,000 bequeathed for the purpose by the late Sheriff Thom. I am informed that the architect under whose advice action is proposed to be taken is Mr. George Mackie Watson. I ought to soy that I am indebted for this information largely to the town clerk and the town council of Kirkwall. Under existing legislation the Government possess no powers in regard to the Cathedral. Therefore they are unable to take such steps as might, in their opinion, be necessary for the preservation of the. building. When I say they possess no powers I ought to make one exception. They have power under the Ancient Monuments Act to take over the guardian ship of the building as an ancient monument at the request of the owners. The First. Commissioner of Works has arranged for the Inspector of Ancient Monuments to visit Kirkwall in August.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE WESTERN ISLANDS OF SCOTLAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01441"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> rose to call attention to the recent Report of the Congested Districts Board (Scotland), and
<col>486</col>
to the present condition of the Western Islands of Scotland; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01442">The noble Earl said: My Lords, a. few days ago I ventured to express the opinion that the state of things in the Western Islands of Scotland was becoming more serious every day. I believe from what I have seen and read since that that opinion is not merely mine but is very general. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland often refers us to the opinion of the Scottish Members. From a debate which has taken place in the other House it would appear that the Scottish Members are of the same opinion that I am with regard to the state of the Western Islands; and, further, they commented very severely on the policy of the present Government. They said that it was dilatory, that the Government had put off doing anything, that questions were allowed to slide, and they made other very severe remarks with regard to the general policy of the Scottish Administration. There is no doubt of this, that the crofters themselves are of that opinion. There is no doubt, too, that the owners of land in the Western Islands are of that opinion, and even if your Lordships take the admissions which are made in the Report of the Congested Districts Board, you will see that even that Report admits that the state of things at present is very serious and is becoming more so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01443">I attach some importance to this Report, because your Lordships must remember that the Congested Districts Board which makes this Report has for its Chairman the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, and therefore it is Lord Pentland, the Chairman of the Congested Districts Board, who is reporting to Lord Pentland, the Secretary for Scotland. In these circumstances it is not very likely that any remarks depreciatory of the present Administration would find their way into the Report; but your Lordships will see from admissions that are made in the Report, to which I will allude presently, that the Board consider that the present state of things, if it has not wholly broken down, at all events is by no means in a prosperous condition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01444">Now let me pass to individual cases. I will begin with the case of the Lews, where the crofter system may be said
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0248"/>
<col>487</col>
to be in a state of perfection. The Lews in the year 1900 had a population of somewhere under 10,000 inhabitants, and in the year 1901 it had a population of 28,000. Its assessable rental is only &#x00A3;34,000 or thereabouts, and out of 404,000 acres which there are in the island no less than 260,000 are under the system of crofts. And when I add that the average rental is under &#x00A3;2&#x2014;I think it is &#x00A3;1 18s. or something of that kind&#x2014;your Lordships will see that the state of cultivation which prevails on that island is one of extremely small holdings, holdings so extremely small that you can hardly expect them to pay. Further than that, you cannot improve on that state of things in the Lews, because it is impossible to give any more land to crofters there, and it is equally impossible to evict any one who falls into arrears, because he is in the Lews and has nowhere else to go.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01445">The estate which really represents nearly the whole of the Lews is the late Sir James Matheson's estate. He brought that estate in 1844, for, I think, &#x00A3;200.000, and he has spent between &#x00A3;500,000 and &#x00A3;600,000 further upon it. What is the condition of that estate at the present time? The owner of it finds himself in the position that he is not able any linger to pay the rates. He has paid them up to the present time, but during the last two or three years it has been done by borrowing upon mortgage, and I have his authority for saying that that he cannot do so any linger. With regard to the rates in the Lews and in the Western Islands generally there has been a good deal of difference of opinion. When noble Lords have said that the rates in many of these Western Islands is more than 20s. in the &#x00A3;, the noble Lord&#x2014;I heard him the other day Ndien that remark was made somewhere on this side of the House&#x2014;has dissented. The fact is that the noble Lord speaks of one sort of pound&#x2014;namely, the pound of gross rental &#x2014;whereas others speak of the assessable pound, which, of course, is a very different thing. But I think we may brush all that kind of argument aside, because, after all, it is not the rate in the pound which is the important point in this matter. What is important is what is the amount of the rates, and how they compote with the income which there is from which to pay these rates.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01446">I will give you in a word or two the position of the Matheson estate, the rental

of which is between &#x00A3;13,500 and &#x00A3;14.000 a year. Out of that the present proprietor has for the last two or three years had to pay on the average &#x00A3;6,000 a year in rates, irrespective, of course, of his Imperial taxes. I need not point out to your Lordships what a great burden that is, and how enormous the proportion of rates is to the general rental. And when we are speaking of this estate your Lordships must remember that, besides that, it is a very costly estate to manage, because the fact that there are 28,000 people in some way or other connected with the estate necessitates the keeping of an enormous number of ' clerks, and in other ways the management is costly. Of course, the rents were all recast by the Crofters Commission, but the arrears on this estate which have accrued since the Crofters Commission revised the rents amounted this year to approximately &#x00A3;19,000. Your Lordships must not suppose that Major Matheson is in any way unpopular. There is no question of a dispute between landlord and tenants. On the contrary, I believe that Major Matheson is extremely popular in the Lews and on the best terms with everybody. But the fact is that the burden of these rates is such that he cannot pay them any more, and the result is that he has been obliged to leave his home and very probably will never take up his residence again on the island.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01447">I must say this with regard to the Report of the Crofters Commission and also this Report which I hold in my hand&#x2014;the Report of the Congested Districts Board&#x2014;that so far as these two Reports are concerned you would never know that there was any question whatever in the Lews. There is no notice of Major Matheson or his difficulties with regard to the rates. His name does appear once, but that is in connection with a proposal which has been almost forced upon him against his will, because he does not wish to stand against the Government, although he does not think it a wise proposal&#x2014;a proposal to cut up the farm of Mangursta into small holdings. Major Matheson has met with very little sympathy from the Scottish Office. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland has been, I think, in the Lews two or three times. He had ample opportunities if he wished to go to the estate office, to speak to Major Matheson on matters of business, or to inquire into the state of affairs; but he did nothing of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0249"/>
<col>489</col>
that sort, and I must say that I think Major Matheson has been treated with rather scant courtesy. Not unnaturally, he has written several times to the Scottish Office and he has written in the present year, but with the exception of an official acknowledgment of his letter this year, in which he stated what I have been just stating to your Lordships, he has received no answer whatever. There is one thing that does strike me as ridiculous in the present position of taxation in this country. I believe that although Major Matheson is unable to pay his rates he will be found actually liable to the Super-Tax. Yes; owing to the present financial arrangements, although he has &#x00A3;6,500 to find which he says he is no longer able to find, yet at the same time he will be liable to Super-Tax under the recent regulations of the Treasury.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01448">Now supposing for a moment that Major Matheson has left the island. What are you going to do then? The result will be, I suppose, that the Government will go on distraining and getting out of the estate whatever they can until they have swallowed up all the available assets. And what is going to happen then? I must say that it seems to me that the future is extremely obscure. And when I say that the state of the Lews at the present time is very serious indeed, I am only echoing what was said in a Report made to the Local Government Board by a Commissioner whom I think they sent specially to inquire&#x2014;a Mr. Maxwell&#x2014; who said the Lews could not possibly go on as it was. The same thing is often said in the Report of the Congested Districts Board which we are now considering. With regard to this crofter system, in the first place there are a number of Government settlements where the land has been purchased by the Government and resold to the settlers. Do those Government settlements succeed? If your Lordships will turn to the Report, you will see this&#x2014;
<quote>"Serious attention has been given to the generally backward state of the payments made by purchasers of holdings from us towards the annuities, by means of which the loans are repaid, and also of rents due to us. In a scheme of State-aided creation of new holdings it is manifestly of the highest importance that the settlers should make punctual payment of the sums due by them. We regret to say that in the case of several estates the settlers, with some exceptions, are considerably in arrear. We thought it our duty to intimate that unless there was an immediate improvement in this respect, steps would be taken to enforce
<col>490</col>
payment or to foreclose. The result of this notice has not been satisfactory, and we have had to take proceedings against certain selected defaulters who we have reason to believe could have met their obligations in a more satisfactory manner than they have done."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01449">That is not a cheerful account of the state of things in these settlements. The statement which I have just read to your Lordships does not appear for the first time by any means in this Report. It is a sort of annual litany. This statement has appeared <i>verbatim</i>, in the last three Reports, and in the one preceding it appeared also with very slight variation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01450">Now what is the result? First of all, there is the Government settlement of Syre. In the year 1908 the arrears there were &#x00A3;210; in 1909, &#x00A3;527; in March, 1910, &#x00A3;600. Next I come to the state of Barra, an island belonging to Lady Cathcart, in Inverness-shire. In 1908 the arrears there due to the Government&#x2014;that is, on account of lands which have been purchased from them for settlements&#x2014;were &#x00A3;227; in March, 1909, they were &#x00A3;410; and in March, 1910, &#x00A3;526. Glendale is a smaller matter, and I pass it over. But in the estate of Kilmuir, which has only been going for some five or six years, the amount of arrears in 1908 was &#x00A3;2,480; in March, 1909, &#x00A3;2,890; and in March, 1910, &#x00A3;3,400. Your Lordships may remember that I and several noble Lords who take an interest in Scottish affairs called attention the other day to a variety of items and endeavoured to obtain information with regard to them. We were not very successful, I admit; but with regard to Kilmuir, at all events, we found out this, that whereas there was a sum of &#x00A3;147,000 which has been spent by the nation, a suns of &#x00A3;46,000 is said to have been received none of which was for sinking fund of the debt, but which was divided in some unknown way between payments received for stock and rent which was paid. But what we took exception to, and what is manifestly bad accounting, is that these payments of rent are in the account subtracted from the total debt, and therefore a man would only have to go on paying rent steadily for a certain number of years in order to wipe out the original sum lent. In other words, in regard to the capital sum spent by the nation, and which you would suppose would be recouped by the rent, no allowance whatever is made. I hope and trust the noble Lord will see that there is some different way of making
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0250"/>
<col>491</col>
up these accounts in future. I wish to be perfectly fair. It is not under the noble Lord's administration that this system of making up the particular Appendix of which I am now Speaking originated. But if this Appendix, which purports to convey to Parliament some idea&#x2014;I do not say an exact idea, but some idea&#x2014;of the way in which these things are going on in the Western Islands, had been drawn up with a view of concealing information instead of giving it, I concur entirely in the remark which fell from the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition the other day that it could not have been better drawn up.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01451">Then, my Lords, I come to Vatersay. I am not going to take your Lordships back into the ancient history of Vatersay. Your Lordships have heard it two or three times in this House. I am only going back to November, 1908, at which period the noble Lord, who, up to that time, had stoutly refused to have anything to do with the purchase of the island and maintained that it was the duty of the proprietor to do all these things that he wished done&#x2014;at that time, for some reason, I do not know what it could have been, suddenly executed a complete <i>volte face</i> and purchased the island. What has occurred on the island since that time? If your Lordships will turn to pages vi and vii of the Report of the Congested Districts Board you will see what is said about it. The Report says that first of all they gave public notice in Barra, inviting applications. In all eighty-three persons applied for the fifty-eight holdings. Three members of the Congested Districts Board attended at Castlebay and interviewed all the applicants or relatives representing them. The Report continues&#x2014;
<quote>"Most careful consideration was given to the information given by these applicants and their references, to enable us to select the persons who in our opinion were best fitted profitably to occupy holdings in the various townships. As five of the men originally chosen renounced their holdings, we were able to fill their places with five others. The proceedings which we had to take against certain squatters for removal were decided in our favour, both by the Sheriff-Substitute and on appeal by the Sheriff."</quote>
From that statement what would. your Lordships naturally suppose? You would suppose that these applications had been sifted and so on, that certain persons who were squatting on the land had notices of ejectment served upon them, that these
<col>492</col>
notices were decided in favour of the Board by the legal authorities, and that those people had disappeared. My Lords, there could be nothing further remote from the fact.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01452">What happened? On April 7, as has been stated in the Report, the Board issued their circular asking for applications, but on April 28 they received a most insolent letter written by a solicitor who was employed by the crofters&#x2014;a gentleman of the name of David Shaw&#x2014; in which lie informed the Board that these persons who had raided the land were on the land, that they meant to stay there, that they disapproved of foreigners being introduced, and, further, they gave the noble Lord notice that he would be responsible if any bloodshed occurred through the arrival of any new persons on the land. Then on June 9 these selections were made for the crofts. Nine of the raiders were rejected. They simply remained. where they were. Actions for ejectment were brought against them, and on November 24 orders against three of them were obtained. But no sooner had they obtained the orders than it was discovered that they had made a mistake, and instead of the orders being, as is stated in the Report, decided "in our favour," leaving the public naturally to infer that the ordinary result followed, what happened was this&#x2014;the Government withdrew their actions and paid the costs. From that day to this no other step has been taken against any of these raiders, and the original three, and, I believe, all the rest, or at all events as many of them as choose, are at present crofters under the noble Lord in Vatersay.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01453">Now let us take the fifty-eight crofters&#x2014;those persons who were selected. I confess that in the terms of the circular they are good enough, because the circular says they are to give satisfaction as to their ability to till the croft, as to their capital, and all sorts of other things. But, to begin with, twenty-three out of these fifty-eight crofters are not resident on the island; they have not a house, and I have no idea how often they go there. They chiefly belong, I understand, to the island of Barra. They entered upon their crofts in November last, and. from then to the present time have not given the slightest sign of intending to go and reside on the island. The noble Lord said the other day that it was expected that before
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0251"/>
<col>493</col>
long these crofters would build their houses. I should very much like to know on what information that expectation is founded. I believe I have better information than has the noble Lord, and my information is that if any steps are taken to force those crofters to take up their crofts or build houses on the island they will go off and give up the crofts. So that there are twenty-three of these men who cannot be said to be very desirable persons as crofters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01454">There are twelve more of them who came from the island of Mingulay. We questioned the noble Lord about them the other day, and he told us that the island of Mingulay was a rock-bound island, and his idea was that these young men seeing an opportunity had gone away, leaving the island almost derelict and in charge, as he said, of a few old men who were unable to launch a boat. Those men I believe to be. at the present time on the island of Vatersay. The noble Lord said there were two who had been crofters, and that there were some others who were cotters. My information&#x2014;and I had the estate account with all the names and so on&#x2014;was that there were certainly twelve men, if not more, who were crofters. I should like to know what amount of capital and what amount of stock they had, and I should also like to know how they satisfied the members of the Crofters Commission that they were persons who were thoroughly well able to make profitable use of a holding.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01455">For a moment let us look at Vatersay as a financial transaction. On one point, at all events, We are agreed. We are agreed upon this, that it is about as bad a transaction financially as it is possible to make. I do not think the noble Lord will dispute it, but I will give him the figures. According to the figures on page 8, Appendix X, a sum of &#x00A3;11,800 has been spent on Vatersay. The expenditure there is not all comprehended in this Report. There will be expenditure in the next year at all events. But let us say, for the sake of round figures, that &#x00A3;12,000 has been spent on Vatersay. How much of that money does the Exchequer or the Congested Districts Board ever expect to see again? Very little. I question whether they will see any. But let us divide up the sum. In the first place there is the money which was paid for the purchase of the island&#x2014;&#x00A3;6,250; in reality all the rest is money
<col>494</col>
which has been virtually given to these crofters or spent upon them, and therefore nearly &#x00A3;5,000 has gone in that way. What return do you get for this? The rent, which was &#x00A3;350 before and which was cheerfully paid&#x2014;it had been &#x00A3;400 at a previous stage&#x2014;is knocked down to &#x00A3;180 after an expenditure of &#x00A3;5,000. That is the present which is made to the crofters. But it has an effect beyond the crofters themselves, because the difference between &#x00A3;180 and &#x00A3;350 has to be deducted from the assessable rental of Barra, and therefore some of the rates which are removed from Vatersay are thrown on to the rest of the parish of Barra. So that, as a financial transaction, nothing could be worse.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01456">I should not have alluded to this, or, at all events, I should not have dealt with it at such length, were it not for this fact, that this is the system which the noble Lord proposes to extend to the whole of Scotland. This is his system. I admit that I have never been able to agree with him that there is a difference between a small holding and a croft. We have not got beyond that elementary fact. The noble Lord thinks that small holdings ought to be treated as crofts, and that there ought to be no private bargains between landlord and tenant with regard to a tenancy below &#x00A3;50. That is his plan. I merely call attention to the way in which it has been carried out on the island of Vatersay, and I hope and trust that no such evil will ever befall Scotland as that this system should be introduced on to the mainland of that country. It is admitted, then, that this Vatersay transaction viewed as a financial transaction is not a success.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01457">Oh, but we are then told that it is a great social success. But is it? We are told that a happy and contented population are to be found on Vatersay, and that this system produces a happy and contented population generally. Does it? Do you think that the remarks which were made in the other House with regard to the Scottish administration indicate that there is general contentment and happiness among the crofters in Scotland? It was said, too, in the other House that on Vatersay there are no arrears. There is one very good reason why there are no arrears&#x2014;no rent has been asked for. These gentlemen entered their holdings in November last; their rent was due in May. We know that the Lord Advocate, who
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0252"/>
<col>495</col>
made this remark, has a great many other things to attend to, but it would be a very good thing if, besides making speeches, he would also look a little into facts. How can there be any arrears on Vatersay? I should be very much surprised if a year or two hence the noble Lord is able to tell us the same, or, indeed, anything like it. But even if these people had been happy and contented there is a good reason. It is this. The noble Lord has given way to them in everything. There they are on Vatersay in spite of his threats; there they are his crofters; he has virtually presented them with the sheep stock; he has spent lots of money upon them. What more could he do? So much, then, for the settlements which belong to the public and have been resold to the crofters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01458">Have the settlements of private owners succeeded any better? I must say the private owners have had very scant justice done to them in this matter. They have been of opinion, from their knowledge of these islands, that this system of crofting could not possibly succeed, but, nevertheless, they gave way to the Government and have done everything that they could to forward the views of the Government in this matter. I do not think they have obtained very generous recognition. Let us take sonic of these settlements by private owners in South Uist. The settlement of Kilbride and one or two other small settlements are very recent, and we do not know much about them. I do not think there are any arrears there, but these people have complained of their rents, which, of course, were adjusted by the Crofters Commission. But on the island of Barra all the old settlements are in arrear. They are three years in arrear of their rent, which is a little over &#x00A3;500. So much for Lady Cathcart's estate. Then we come to the estate of Bay in Skye, which your Lordships will see alluded to in the Report of the Crofters Commission of this year, page xiii. This is what is said&#x2014;
<quote>"In 1900 the proprietor [MacLeod] resolved to make an experiment in the formation of large holdings, which it was hoped would enable the settlers when placed on them to earn a fair living. He broke up the farm of Bay into five such holdings, extending to about 12 acres each, with a common pasture of about 4,000 acres. These holdings he let at a rent of &#x00A3;21 each, in terms of an agreement entered into, to five persons chosen by him. They got entry at Whitsunday, 1901.&#x2026;The settlers fell deeply into arrears and pleaded that they were not able to pay the rents set forth in the agreement."</quote></p>
<col>496</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01459">The Crofters Commission went and heard the parties, and afterwards inspected the subjects and arrived at this conclusion&#x2014;
<quote>"If the settlers could stock the land and manage the same properly, they should be able to pay the rents stated in the agreement.&#x2026;In all the circumstances we were of opinion that the rents on which the settlers had entered were fair rents, and that therefore we could not reduce them or cancel the arrears which had arisen thereon, It is obvious that the settlement is not in a thriving position, and that unless the whole place is fully stocked and better managed than it has been, no progress can be expected."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01460">So the settlement of Bay does not flourish.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01461">Then we come to the Lews. There Major Matheson broke up the farm of Aignish, and the rent was fixed at &#x00A3;96; at present there are arrears of &#x00A3;90. At the same time the Government made a loan to the settlers of Aignish for the purpose of building their houses, and out of &#x00A3;355 clue as instalments for the payment of those houses the sum of &#x00A3;60 only has been paid. Let us go next to Battery Park, which was also divided by Major Matheson. The feu duty which ought to be paid to him is &#x00A3;27 a year. As a matter of fact the arrears at this moment&#x2014;and that, again, has been only in four or five years&#x2014;are &#x00A3;50, or going on towards two years rental. On the other hand the Government advanced money for building houses, and out of a sum of &#x00A3;293 due in instalments only &#x00A3;117 has been paid. Can your Lordships call those successes? Yet in spite of this the noble Lord, with all these facts before him, perseveres in desiring and in requiring that new farms should be cut up; and your Lordships will find in this Report that the farm of Mangursta is being cut up by Major Matheson to please the Government. It is not his notion that this Mangursta farm can possibly succeed as crofts. His opinion is exactly the reverse&#x2014;I am authorised to say so&#x2014;but he has done it simply because he has been pressed to do so by the Government. So that there, at all events, he has done everything in his power to forward their view. And further than this, something less than 100 years ago there were crofters on Mangursta, and they were removed from their crofts at their own request because it was impossible to make that farm succeed as crofts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01462">Now let us leave these points and come to the question of school rates. It is the pressure of the rates which is doing more than anything else to kill these islands.</p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0253"/>
<col>497</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01463">These rates are bound to increase. As you cut up farms, as you increase the population, as you insist on education and other matters of ordinary civilisation, so, of course, the expenses increase, and the rates must go up. Take the most recent case that has occurred, the case of South Uist. There three new schools have been built during the previous year. The school board called upon the parish council to assess the island for &#x00A3;1,600. The parish council knew perfectly well that they could not raise the money, and they said so. The school board, in compliance with the Act, took them to Edinburgh. The matter was debated and it was decided, as it must be for it is according to the law, that the school board are entitled to call upon the parish council to find any money they require. As to the legal merits, there could, of course, be no doubt, but the Judge who tried the case made some severe remarks with regard to this matter. As to the law there was, he said, no doubt, and he was bound to give a decree. But he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Recently certain Farms on the island of South Uist have been broken up by the proprietor, at the instance of the Government and with the co-operation of the Congested Districts Board, into small holdings for occupation by crofters. The population which has thus been transplanted to form the tenants of the new holdings previously resided in crofter townships where adequate school accommodation existed, and some of the farms now broken up are situated at a distance from the existing schools. In consequence of this shifting of the population the school board of the parish decided to erect new schools and to provide additional school accommodation."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01464">And he proceeded to say that this was an anomalous state of matters, and this unfortunate condition had, he said, arisen from various causes, the chief being the shifting of the population owing to certain farms having been broken up at the instance of the Government into small holdings. I do not think that it was possible for any learned Judge to deliver a stronger opinion with regard to the equity of the case than that which Lord Salvesen delivered. So much for South Uist.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01465">I now take the case of the parish of Barra. In the parish of Barra at the present time the school rate is 7d. in the &#x00A3;, but owing to this establishment of the noble Lord's at Vatersay a new school has to be erected there. The noble Lord told us the other day that it was to cost about &#x00A3;1,000. At the same time the island of Mingulay, in the same parish, had a school, but when the population of
<col>498</col>
that island rowed away from Mingulay and went to Vatersay the school at Mingulay had to be shut up. What is the result? The parish council is hit in two ways. First of all its existing school is closed, and now it has to pay for a new school on the island of Vatersay. And, my Lords, what security is there that five years hence there will he anybody on Vatersay? I have been there twice, and I should be very much surprised indeed if five years hence there are any persons on Vatersay. The noble Lord, I think, has never been to Vatersay. He was very near it once or twice, and was invited to go. He was down as near as Lochboisdale, and three hours would have taken him to this settlement of his, but he has hitherto exercised a wise discretion and refrained from going. What will be the result in the island of Barra? The school rate in that island, which up to the present time has been 7d., will, I am told on excellent authority, be from 4<i>s</i>. to 5<i>s</i>. in the &#x00A3;. That is the result of this transmigration of crofters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01466">There is another fact which aggravates this condition of things. Up to the year 1908, when the school rate of any village in Scotland exceeded 1s. 6<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;, three-fourths of the difference was made up by a grant front the Exchequer. I believe that rule still prevails in England, but in Scotland it was abolished in the year 1908 by an Act which was brought in by the noble Lord, and therefore there is no means of their getting a grant. The power of giving grants, which undoubtedly was freely exercised in the case of these islands, has entirely disappeared. So the noble Lord has not only created this new settlement and thereby increased the rates, but he has also taken away the means that previously existed of alleviating the rates. All this was not done without warning, because Lady Cathcart, when she gave way against her judgment and agreed to form these settlements, pointed out to the Government, in distinct and express terms, this very danger, that by increasing the population you must necessarily increase the education rate. She asked front them a condition, to which they acceded so far as they said they could, that no additional expense should be thrown on these islands with regard to education. A grant was made, but the Public Accounts Committee came to the conclusion that it was not in the power.
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0254"/>
<col>499</col>
of the Government to give these grants. They indicated at the same time, however, that it might be done from certain other sources; but up to the present time the noble Lord has not attempted in any way to deal with this difficulty. He has not attempted to move a special grant. I believe that if he proposed to get a special grant he would have very little difficulty in obtaining it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01467">I am sorry to have troubled your Lordships so long. I will only say a word or two more. This system of crofting has been on its trial and is on its trial now. I very much wish it could succeed, but it is quite clear that in certain cases it is failing, and has failed, and I do not see any indications where it is proving a success. The essence of this system is that it is eleemosynary. That is to say, the public taxpayer provides money for building houses which, of course, it is expected will be repaid; but with regard to fencing the land and preparing it for the settlement by crofters, and really I am bound to say with regard actually to finding the stock, except to a very limited amount, because promises in the Hebrides to pay, as your Lordships know, are a very different thing from actual payment, in reality the public has started and is supporting these crofts on an eleemosynary system. If you think that is for the public interest, then be consistent and go on and pay the rates, or, at all events, a considerable portion of them. The noble Lord has put off dealing with this question for a very long time. He has shifted and shuffled about, and has endeavoured to get rid of the difficulty by looking away from it, but he may depend upon it that he will never overcome difficulties by that course of action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01468">The situation has now become so grave, as he must have seen from proceedings in the other House and as I am sure he has been told in this House, that it cannot wait any longer. There are various ways in which this may be met. One of them has been proposed by Lord Balfour in the Local Taxation Commission's Report&#x2014;that is, that public grants should be increased in the proportion to which the population stands to assessable revenue. That is one way. There may be others, but of this the noble Lord may be sure, that it is impossible to delay or procrastinate any longer. This question is a very
<col>500</col>
urgent one which demands and must receive immediate solution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01469">Moved, That there be laid before the House Papers relating to the present condition of the Western Islands of Scotland. &#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Camperdown.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01470"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the beginning of the noble Earl's speech lie told your Lordships that the condition of the Western Islands of Scotland is a serious one, and is annually becoming more so. I do not think that any one who is acquainted with these islands, or even any one who has studied the successive Reports of the Congested Districts Board, can doubt the accuracy of that statement. The noble Earl went into many matters of very serious importance to the Western Islands. He dealt with individual cases of hardship, many of them of very real hardship, particularly the case of Major Matheson, which I hope will receive the serious attention of the Secretary for Scotland. I do not wish to follow the noble Earl into those details, but I should like to say a word more generally upon the methods and the system of the Congested Districts Board, and the result of their management in the past few years.<lb/>
The Report which we have before us deals not only with this one year, but it is to some extent a general review of the work of the Board over a long period. I certainly have no wish to criticise in any way unduly the work and methods of the Board. I know something of the very serious difficulties with which that Board had to contend when they were first called into existence twelve years ago, and I know the character of the experiments with which they started in the hope of solving what I fear they have come to look upon as an almost insoluble problem. They attempted to assist the existing population to remain on the land and to make a living, and this object was, from every point of view, worthy of all praise. But I fear, in the light of the Reports that have been issued, that we are bound to look upon them as people who have been attempting what really has become impossible. In order to carry out their object they have had to change the system which they found in existence agriculturally in many of these islands&#x2014;a system of combination of large and small farms, a combination which we believe is more
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0255"/>
<col>501</col>
suited to agriculture as we know it in these islands and elsewhere throughout the kingdom. They Lad in this place to a large extent existing land owners, and they had to displace existing tenants and get rid of large farms, and to split their holdings up amongst the existing population. The soil of these islands is of a very poor nature; it is in many instances little more than inferior grazing land; and even though it is now broken up it is doubtful whether any part of it, even the very best of the soil, will for long bear cultivation. It was possible to use this land as grazing land, and in the past it did attract men with capital and a thorough knowledge of their business, and they were able to make a living for themselves and their families and pay their way. But the system which is now adopted takes the land out of the hands of those men and gives it to people who have little knowledge and less capital, and, in doing so, has reduced the rental value and the produce of the land, and consequently there has been a reduction of value to the whole community.<lb/>
I do not want to go into details in these matters, but I do want to give your Lordships a proof of the reduction in value of the laud since this system has been adopted. I will ask the Secretary for Scotland to think of the case of Barra. It was not done in his tune; bat that island was purchased by the Board in 1901 for the market price of &#x00A3;7,920. It was obvious that the people for whom it was intended could not pay that price, so it was handed over to them at a lesser sum, and the balance is accounted for as a loss on the purchase. My point is this, that under the old system it was worth so much, whereas under the new system it is worth so much less; consequently there is a loss to the community owing to this system of very small holdings which the Board has adopted. This division and sub-division of land, as I think my noble friend Lord Camperdown suggested to your Lordships, is a part of the sort of craving after small holdings which is gradually spreading throughout the country. I believe every one of your Lordships will agree that, under certain favourable conditions, this spread of small holdings is an excellent thing, but there are certain conditions which are fundamental to the success of small holdings. In the first place, you must have a population who are able and willing to work, and who are to sonic extent capable of sustained
<col>502</col>
labour. Most important of all, you must have a kindly soil which is fit for cultivation, and which will return to the small holder a profit. You must have a fair amount of capital on the part of your small holder, and, in addition, you must be within fair reach of labour markets. It is very doubtful indeed if many of these conditions are fulfilled in these Western Islands. One is naturally very glad that in this Report one is able to point to certain instances of success, but I regret to think that the successful part of the scheme is far and away outweighed by the failures that have taken place.<lb/>
I should like your Lordships to observe certain facts in the conduct and work of the administration of the Board&#x2014;facts which, in my opinion, are wholly favourable to the Board up to a certain point. There has been on these Western Islands a great expenditure of public money. The Congested Districts Board have been lavish in their gifts to the smaller people. They have provided them with stock at much less than cost price; they have provided them in some cases with land at a less price than they paid for it; and consequently they have suffered very heavy losses. They have lent them money at low rates of interest and on easy terms of repayment, and in many cases those terms have not been observed. They have started schemes for communication and inter-communication both by steamers and by motor cars, but those schemes in some cases have been so little taken advantage of that they have had to be discontinued. In addition, they have started schemes of employment and instruction, which also have not, according to this Report, been so well taken advantage of as was anticipated. Those were experiments, and so far as they were experiments they are entirely to the credit of the Board, and if they had been successful not one of us would have used a word against them. But, my Lords, these experiments have gone on for twelve years, so that they are now rather past the experimental stage. And what is the net result? By your expenditure and by your loans and free gifts you have been encouraging men to attempt what I believe to be the impossible. You have been encouraging them to continue on land and at a work which cannot provide them with an independent living, and though they may leave it will be your duty to provide for them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0256"/>
<col>503</col>
I think they have been fixed there probably as pensioners of the State, and although they may leave it is quite impossible that they can do anything to improve their position, and they are merely, as we say, increasing their indebtedness to the State.<lb/>
My Lords, are we doing any good whatever in encouraging these people to remain in their home lands in a condition of poverty, depending for their living on the forbearance of the State, with an annually increasing load of debt accumulating around them, and with a future which I fear is absolutely hopeless? If we were doing any good in this matter, either to the individual or to the country, I should believe that all our expenditure was valuable and would be justifiable, but I do not think we are doing good. It can be shown that the condition of the people of these Western Islands has in many instances changed for the worst. Poverty is increasing; the poor rate, whatever the actual amount may be, has reached an abnormal figure in those islands. If we are not doing good I fear very much we are doing harm. We are rearing up a population there which is dependent for a living on the forbearance, and, I might also say, on the charity of the State. I believe we are sapping the independence of these people.<lb/>
I will give one instance. The noble Lord will recollect that there was a distribution of seed. The details of it appear in most of these Reports. At the time of a bad harvest the Board very properly and very generously distributed seed among these distressed crofters. I think probably all of us have had to do that in our own time. It proved very useful to these crofters; they planted the seed and reaped good crops, but they saved no seed for the next year, I suppose with the idea that the Government having done it once would do it again. The Report says&#x2014;
<quote>"In introducing new seed we did not contemplate a continuous supply, but it became clear that crofters and cotters looked upon us as a constant source of supply, and in many cases took no steps to grow good seed for distribution, or to supply themselves with seed, but simply looked to us to send them what they required each spring."</quote>
That seems to me to show that we are destroying the independence of these people. The Report goes on to say that complaints were made, and accordingly they made it widely known that they considered it inexpedient that it should be
<col>504</col>
considered that they did more than intervene now and then to introduce a change of seed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01471"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Any distribution of seed to which the noble Lord could take exception has been stopped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01472"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I find almost exactly the same statement, that they only give the seed occasionally, in their Report of five or six years ago, and it has continued ever since. I hope the noble Lord will not discontinue the supply of seed where it is necessary, but I think those words show quite clearly that the fact of having given this seed has induced in the minds of these men the idea that they have got the bottomless purse of the State behind them, and that they can draw upon it whenever they please. The sapping of the independence of these men will have a bad effect on national character, and treating them financially as they have been treated has, in addition, imbued them with the idea that their contracts with the State, as far as money payments are concerned, can be broken almost at will. I believe this has done harm to many of these holders, and it is a question how far the Board can in justice allow this system to continue. The system cannot be recommended as a financial one. No one has ever suggested that it can actually pay, and it has never been expected to pay. It is never expected that there can be an adequate return from it. It was considered that there was an element of possibility in it, that it might be expected to benefit the people of these islands. That is the whole excuse for the method of the Congested Districts Board; and if it can be shown from your own Reports that it has neither been successful financially nor successful in being of benefit to a large number of people in the Western Islands, then there is no possible excuse for continuing this system.<lb/>
I do not wish to continue my observations, because we have been speaking on this matter now for a considerable length of time; but I do hope the noble Lord will not only take these matters into consideration, having regard to the possible harm that is done to the crofters in the Western Islands, but that he will consider whether these experiments, which were perfectly justifiable at the beginning, ought to be continued when they are known to have failed. I believe that the experiments
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0257"/>
<col>505</col>
that have been begun should. be finished to the end, but before the Government go into the further sub-division of large farms and create a. great number of small holdings they ought. to be convinced that there is a reasonable prospect of success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01473"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate which the noble Earl has initiated this evening is in the first place a criticism of the work of the Congested Districts Board, and before it proceeds further I should like to say a word or two as to that Department, and first as to the constitution of the Board, for which not this Government but the Unionist. Government of 1897 were responsible. It consists of the Secretary for Scotland, the Under-Secretary, three heads of Departments, and three nominated members, two of whom are at the present time high officials in the public service in Scotland, the remaining member being a crofter of great sagacity and experience, who, I think, was nominated by the noble Lord, Lord Balfour, and who has proved of great service in many ways to the work of the Board.<lb/>
The Secretary for Scotland must inevitably, as the Parliamentary representative of the Bard, bear the chief responsibility for the administration of its work; but the other members, I must point out, who receive no remunaration whatever for their services and who are all hard-working men connected with other public Departments, have given an infinity of time and labour. to the work of this Board, and they are as competent, as faithful, and as public-spirited as any public servants, either in Scotland or out, of it.. So that, so far as they are concerned, the criticisms which are levelled against the Board are wholly, to my mind, without justification.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I do say this, that the work of the Board has entirely outgrown its constitution. It has multiplied many times since the Board was set up. That is not a discovery made at this moment. Those who first recognised it, I think, were His Majesty's Government, who in 1906 and 1907 introduced proposals connected with land reform in Scotland, part of which consisted of proposals for abolishing the Congested Districts Board and merging it in a Department of Agriculture, manned by paid officials who should do that work for Scotland. This House rejected that policy. Your Lordships declined even to consider it.<lb/>
<col>506</col>
I am not going to re-argue that matter now; but I do say the responsibility for the lack of legislative change to reconstitute this Board lies, not with His Majesty's Government, but with your Lordships' House. I have made some administrative changes failing legislation, and I hope to make more changes as time goes on, but those are the only limits which at present are possible or open to us to increase the usefulness and effectiveness of the Board. The noble Earl who opened this debate discussed the island of Vatersav at some length. I was ready to deal with points which arose in the course of the discussion the other day on the questions which the noble Earl put to me, but I pass those over, as time presses. The noble Earl has initiated a discussion which travels over a. very wide area, and if he should wish for information on any of those points I am ready to give it to him.<lb/>
I now come to the important point possibly the vital point, which the noble Earl mentioned&#x2014;the difference between the late rent paid by the farm tenant. and the total rent now payable by the crofters. The farm tenant paid &#x00A3;350, and the crofters pay as an accumulated rent &#x00A3;180. That rent was fixed by the Crofters Commission, or, rather, the crofters' rents which go to make up that sum were fixed by the Crofters Commission, and the Congested Districts Board are content to acquiesce in that decision. I believe it to be a fair rent, and it has all the authority of the Crofters Commission behind it. No doubt the land yields less rent, but part of the work of the Congested Districts Board is to relieve congestion. Barra is a congested parish. There was a large squatter population there. Vatersay formerly maintained two families, probably ten people. It is now thought that it will maintain, when all the settlers are there, at least 150 people. The congestion, therefore, is to that extent relieved. I should not allude to this matter if I were not challenged on the point, but I must remind your Lordships after what the noble Earl has said that it was not the wish of the Government to enter upon this purchase. Furthermore, it appears from the correspondence that it was not this drop in rent which determined Lady Cathcart against dividing up the farm. The Government offered to pay her fall compensation for the drop in the rent. What they did decline was to guarantee her the payment of the rents, reduced and divided as I have described them; and this is not the first time, as
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0258"/>
<col>507</col>
I think Lord Clinton reminded us, that the Government of this country have lost money over a transaction in the parish of Barra. Lord Balfour, when he was Secretary for Scotland, for the same purpose&#x2014;to relieve congestion&#x2014;purchased part of the island of Barra, and the Government of that day were obliged to lose an initial sum of &#x00A3;2,000 on the purchase before it could be handed over to the tenants who now occupy it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01474"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My point was that the new system which the Board adopted must entail a loss of money value, not to the Board or to the people interested themselves, but to the whole country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01475"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I will come to that point if the noble Lord will allow me. But I say that no Government which is fit to be a Government can be a willing purchaser of such land. The published Papers give the whole story of Vatersay. They are very full, and the question has been discussed in this House. I do not, therefore, propose to reopen the matter. The Government were forced to step in and purchase the land to relieve the necessities of the very people whom the noble Earl alluded to to-day because they had raided the island and by the inactivity of the proprietor were allowed to remain there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01476"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Of course, I take exception to that statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01477"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I quite expected the noble Earl would; but what I do ask him is, What is the purpose of this criticism to-day? Does the noble Earl quarrel with the Government for purchasing the land under those circumstances? What is his answer? Does he say that the Government should not have bought Vatersay? If I recollect, the noble Earl was one of those who pressed the purchase of Vatersay upon the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01478"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01479"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Then there is no criticism coming from him in the other direction. Does he contend that the Government should not have given a fair price for Vatersay? I should like to know whether he has any criticism on that point?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01480"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No, none whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<col>508</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01481"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Would he urge the Government to fix the rents at a higher value than that which has been determined by the Crofters' Commission? Does he say that the Government should not have done their best to provide water and schools and roads and the other necessities of life in that island? Because that is what his criticism means if it means anything. The noble Earl criticises the Government for spending money on this property. They were obliged to spend money upon it if the people there were to have the bare necessities of civilised life. The noble Lord, Lord Clinton, does supply the motive, I think, for the criticism which has been made with regard to Vatersay to-day. He seems to suggest that it may be regarded as a fair example and illustration of the policy of the present Government in regard to the creation of small holdings. He will, of course, pardon me for suggesting that he does, but he does not go so far as that, I am sure other people do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01482"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I raised no objection to the policy of the Government with regard to small holdings. What I said was that the system had proved an objectionable one in the Western Islands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01483"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think it was the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, who held up the example of the Congested Districts Board here and elsewhere as an example of what the Government wished to apply to Scotland as a whole. I cannot understand, and I really would like to understand, how that statement can be made. The agricultural conditions of the Western Islands differ in almost every essential from parts of the same counties and from other counties in Scotland. The proposals of the Government dealt not only with the Western Islands but with other parts of Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01484"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: In the same way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01485"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, not in the same way. The noble Earl makes a mistake in thinking that any Government can transport the same conditions which exist in Vatersay and the Western Islands to the counties of Forfar or Dumfries. It is quite beyond the power of any Government to do so. I will give you one instance. Lord Clinton pointed out that in this breaking up of Vatersay we were obliged to lose rent, and that there had to be a drop in
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0259"/>
<col>509</col>
the value of the land. Is it not within the knowledge of any noble Lord who knows Scotland that there are farms and land in many counties of Scotland which, if broken up into small holdings and equipped with buildings, would fetch a higher rent than they do now held in a single large farm? The very work of the Congested Districts Board shows that there are such places.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01486"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Where?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01487"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: There is a case in Caithness where the owner of Dunbeath broke up his own home farm. The Congested Districts Board gave their help, and there was not one shilling less of rent to that proprietor from the transaction which was thus carried out. If that can be done in Caithness, it can be done in nearly every other county of Scotland; and therefore as a condemnation of the proposals of His Majesty's Government in regard to small holdings Vatersay is no good whatever. If the noble Earl who opened this discussion does not wish to condemn the present administration of Vatersay, and if, as I contend, such transactions are neither a guide to nor an illustration of the probable effect of the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to small holdings in the rest of Scotland, I must say I fail to see the real usefulness of the discussion.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I will pass to the general question of the high rates in these islands. Your Lordships discussed this question at some length last year and. I would save your Lordships' time by simply reminding you of the main conclusion which I ventured to submit to you on that occasion&#x2014;namely, that when all the factors are taken into consideration it is not the burden of the rate, heavy as it is, which is so far excessive in these Western Islands, but the distribution of that burden owing largely to the presence in these communities of a considerable cotter and squatter population who pay neither rent nor rates, yet contribute their quota to the burden which is laid upon the rates by the population. So far as South Uist is concerned, and so far as the parish of Barra is concerned, such examination of the figures as I have been able to make entirely supports the conclusion of last year which I have just quoted. And perhaps I may remind your Lordships of what was said then, that it is very desirable to bring the cotters and squatters into the limits of a rent-paying and rate-paying
<col>510</col>
population, and by so doing relieve the burden upon the other ratepayers. Again I must remind your Lordships that the I Land Holders Bill which was submitted for consideration contained legislative proposals for effecting that purpose, and failing legislative changes I see very little chance of being able to effect what undoubtedly is a very desirable change. But I must point out that in the meantime, pending the endeavour which the Government have announced for next year to deal with the general question of the reform of local taxation&#x2014;and I may say, in passing, that. there is no more pressing part of that subject than that of the poorer parishes in Scotland&#x2014;considerable relief has been given particularly to these outer parishes, which have unfortunately among them in their population so large a proportion of older people, the strong and the vigorous having in many cases left to seek their fortune elsewhere. By the Old Age Pensions Act they have from this peculiarity reaped a considerable benefit. The relief given to each parish from old age pensions amounts to something like from two to three and a-half times the whole amount of the poor rates levied in these parishes.<lb/>
The noble Earl said something about the education rate. I should like to say a word about that. The education rate is not the heavy rate in these parishes. It is the poor rate which is the heavy rate. I think your Lordships would be astonished at the sums demanded in the name of the education rate from the ratepayers in these parishes as a rule. Take the parish of South Uist, where this difficulty has arisen. In 1906&#x2013;07 the total education rate was is. fid., the next year it was 11&#x00BD;d., and the next year 2<i>s</i>. 4&#x00BD;d. Let me remind you how the rate is divided. It is divided between the owner and the occupier. In Barra the rate for 1906&#x2013;07 for special causes was 3<i>s</i>. 9&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> In the following year it was 9<i>d</i>., in the year following that, 6d., and this year it is again 6<i>d</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01488"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: What will it be next year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01489"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The same is true even of the island of Lewis. I will take the figures for the parish of Barvas for four years. They ranged between 4<i>d</i>., 8<i>d</i>., 10<i>d</i>. and l<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. For the parish of Lochs they were 4<i>d</i>., 4d., 9&#x00BD;d. and 11d. For the parish of Uig, the rates are somewhat heavier. I am reluctant to trouble your Lordships with
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0260"/>
<col>511</col>
many figures. The reason of these low rates is that properly generous Parliamentary grants have been made. The cost of education is very much lightened in these parishes by special grants for that purpose. That being the general state of educational expenditure and rating in those parishes, I would ask your Lordships for a moment to consider the difficulty which has arisen in South Uist. The Scottish Office has been somewhat fiercely attacked in this matter, and though I am trespassing on your Lordships' indulgence 1 am sure you will allow me to say what has to be said in order to disclose the true position. I should like, in the first place, to say that this is quite a separate and special matter from even the ordinary educational expenditure. As I understand it from the noble Earl who mentioned this subject, the charge against the Government is that the proprietor of certain farms in South Uist, having decided to break up those farms in order that they might he tenanted by crofters, sought the financial help of the Congested Districts Board. That help was given, and it was at first intended that it should include financial assistance towards the erection of new schools. To make a long story short, it was decided by the action of the Public Accounts Committee, whose attention had been called to the matter by the Auditor-General, that it was <i>ultra vires</i> to give money for this purpose, and the Board were thus unable to make good their intention in that matter. But, putting aside that point, the schools had to be provided; the execution of this duty by the school board imposed a heavy obligation upon the parish, and they were faced with the necessity of raising &#x00A3;1,600 in rates in the year 1910. This involved a rate of something like 11s. 4d. in the pound for education alone, and it is now urged that this is a monstrous injustice not only to one class but to all classes of the community, and that the Government are largely responsible for it.<lb/>
Now, what are the facts? Early in 1906 Lady Cathcart announced her intention of breaking up these farms to be occupied by seventy tenants. School accommodation had to be provided. Proposals were laid by the school board before the Scottish Education Department in the ordinary way for approval in November, 1907. They were revised, and the estimated outlay was reduced by the Department. The school board gave the Department no sign of any complaint, no warning, no apprehension as
<col>512</col>
to difficulty likely to be experienced by them in carrying out their duty. Eighteen months or more after this the school bard informed the Department that the parish council bad refused to levy the rate for &#x00A3;1,600, and would only consent to levy &#x00A3;500. Subsequently the school board raised an action against the parish council in the Court of Session, and the first information which reached the Department of that action having been taken was the announcement in the newspapers. I am sure your Lordships will agree that it is deplorable that two local bodies working in the same parish should not be able to settle such a difference without resorting to the expense of litigation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01490"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01491"><member>LORE PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: In my opinion it is. Complaint is being made of the burden of rates, and such action can only tend to increase the burden ultimately to be borne by the ratepayers of the parish. I think that before a step of that kind was taken every other means should have been exhausted of endeavouring to adjust the differences, whereas it is evident, so far as I am informed, that no such efforts were made. The decision of the Court was that the parish council should levy the rate. This matter was discussed in another place last week, and the Lord Advocate undertook, on my behalf, that the rate should not be actually levied until full information had been received by the Scottish Office in regard to the matter. That information has been received, and the parish council&#x2014;it is a nominated parish council under the Poor Law Act, to take the place of the former parish council responsible for this business, who have resigned&#x2014;this acting parish council have been instructed to levy the rate, and I trust that nothing will be said in this debate to discourage the payment of debts which are lawfully due from the ratepayers in this parish in regard to this matter.<lb/>
In the vast majority of cases this rate is not the monstrous burden it is described to be. I will ask your Lordships to let me analyse this &#x00A3;1,600. Five hundred pounds has been collected, involving a rate of l<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. on owners and 2<i>s.</i> on occupiers. The present demand is for a rate of 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. on owners and 6<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. on occupiers. I trust your Lordships will not be alarmed at those figures until you have heard the explanation
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0261"/>
<col>513</col>
of them. In the first place, what is the true measure of this burden&#x2014;that is to say, the actual amount demanded from the ratepayers? The nominal rate is 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. upon owners and 6<i>s</i>. 4d. on occupiers, but these sums are not levied upon the actual rental. In the case of every ratepayer they are levied upon a rental which is subject to statutory deductions for the purpose of this assessment. From the rental of every occupier of this parish and from every owner there is made a deduction of forty-five per cent., and in the case of agricultural occupiers there is a further deduction under the Agricultural Rates Act of five-eighths of their assessment. In the case of owners these deductions amount to 9<i>s</i>.; in the case of non-agricultural occupiers also to 9<i>s</i>.; and in the case of agricultural occupiers the total deductions amount to 15<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>., leaving 4<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. instead of &#x00A3;1 as the rent upon which the assessment is levied. So that we have this result, that while the nominal rate is what I have described the actual amount, of rates in the pound paid by each occupier is&#x2014;for owners, 1<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>.; for nonagricultural occupiers, 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>,; and for farmers and crofters, is. 4<i>d</i>. in the pound. We arrive at this result., that in respect of the supplementary assessment&#x2014;I am not speaking of the whole assessment for education for this purpose, some of which has already been levied&#x2014;to raise this sum of &#x00A3;1,100, out of 909 ratepayers 803 will be called upon to pay something less than 10<i>s</i>., and 560 of them will be called upon to pay something less than a total of 5<i>s</i>. The next question I would like to put before your Lordships is this. Who is responsible for this rate? The suggestion of the noble Earl is that it is due to the necessity of building new schools on these crofter settlements.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01492"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Lord Salvesen said so in his judgment, having heard the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01493"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am quite aware of that fact, but I think I shall be able to show even the noble Earl that that is not the ease. First of all, every school board has to provide for the current increase of population in its parish. Secondly, this school board bad to provide for the enlargement, and, I think, the erection of schools in Lochboisdale involving the borrowing of a sum of &#x00A3;2,150 for that purpose. There are other items which reduce the sum of &#x00A3;1,600 to a much smaller amount. In the first
<col>514</col>
place, in that &#x00A3;1,600 there is a sum of arrears of &#x00A3;339 which should have been levied by the school board or the parish council in the year before. Again, by not levying those arrears the school board lost part of the amount, amounting to something over &#x00A3;140. Further, there is a sum of &#x00A3;327 in respect of teachers' salaries at the new schools which w ill be repaid by the grant in the usual course next year. Adding these three amounts together we have a sum of &#x00A3;806, which has to be subtracted from the &#x00A3;1,600 before we see the true elements of the ordinary necessities which the school board and the parish council had to meet. There is a further sum of &#x00A3;238, which represents the interest of loans for new schools, but, again, of this &#x00A3;107 is due in respect of schools other than those in question. So that you have out of the &#x00A3;1,600 apart from current expenditure, the sum of &#x00A3;131 only to be raised by the school board in respect of these new schools. It is, therefore, perfectly evident that the expense of erecting new schools for the crofter settlements is the least of all the items which have contributed to create the present situation. These new schools are responsible for &#x00A3;131 out of &#x00A3;1,600&#x2014;not a twelfth of the whole sum.<lb/>
I submit to your Lordships, therefore, that the responsibility for this matter lies, not with the Scottish Education Department nor with any other Government Department, but with the school board and the parish council themselves. They made no provision whatever for the future. They did not face. their obligations in time either in respect to the Lochboisdale schools or the rural schools. So far as the rural schools are concerned, it was known in 1906 that those schools would be necessary. Three years rating passed, and during each one of these three years the school board and the parish council together&#x2014;I do not know who was responsible&#x2014;did nothing to raise the necessary money which they would have to expend on this purpose. They left their arrears to the future. In the year 1906&#x2013;07 the total education rate was Is. 6<i>d</i>.; in the following year, 11&#x00BD;<i>d</i>.; in the year following that it was 2s. 4&#x00BD;<i>d</i>., and in that year they left this sum of &#x00A3;339 unprovided for. My Lords, those are the facts of the case, and I think they speak for themselves. This agitation does not come in any degree from the crofters and the farmers. So far as I know they have made no complaint. They know perfectly well that in respect to the rate for education their burden is exceed-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0262"/>
<col>515</col>
ingly light as a rule, and I am mistaken if they do not know that this expenditure is wholly abnormal.<lb/>
It is not necessary to repeat to your Lordships what I said last year about the case of the proprietors on these islands and the non-agricultural occupiers. For my part I trust that their case will be fully considered next year when the Government hope to deal with the whole subject. It is far from welcome to me to speak harshly or to speak in a critical way of those who carry on local administration in these remote parishes. They do their work under great difficulties, and. my sympathies are wholly with them in the work which they do; but I am bound to say that in this matter this crisis might, by prudent administration, have been at any rate very greatly mitigated. Lean years will always eat up fat years, and while I have sympathy with those who have to face the difficulties of local administration, I have nothing but condemnation for those, if there are any such, who, in the interests of the larger proprietors or of the non-agricultural occupiers to whose case I have alluded, seek to persuade the great majority of the ratepayers who are not heavily burdened by the normal educational burden, who live lives of toil and hardship and who are the first to suffer from bad government, to resist the law and to join in agitation for the non-payment of rates. I would earnestly warn the crofters and their friends to reject the advice and encouragement of those who thus wish to use them for their own purposes. Such an agitation will increase the difficulty and the expense ultimately to be borne by the ratepayers. Already the litigation between two local authorities in the same parish has cost &#x00A3;200, and I believe the members of one are also members of the other. My Lords, no agitation will alter the facts, which I have done my best to lay before your Lordships' House on this occasion.<lb/>
Now as to relief for this situation. In justice to the ratepayers who provide the money, whatever method of relief is finally found it must have regard to similar burdens elsewhere if it is to be fair to other parts of the country. The noble Earl alluded to a necessitous school grant which was in operation some time ago. I think its operation expired in 1909, but that was a grant which for three years was paid by the Treasury for the purpose of
<col>516</col>
relieving heavily-burdened parishes both in England and Scotland. The sum was strictly limited in amount, and was provided as a temporary expedient only. So far as Scotland is concerned, the arrangement came to an end on the creation of the Education (Scotland) Fund in March, 1909. To this Fund the Treasury made a contribution far in excess of all the grants which were swept into the Fund. A method of allocation of the Education (Scotland) Fund was adopted which gave to the more necessitous districts, such as Inverness and Ross-shire, a sum greatly in excess of what they had previously received for similar purposes, and as a result of this method of distributing the Fund it was hoped that there would be no occasion to renew the grant, which was admittedly of a purely stop-gap character. That expectation, through a variety of causes, has not been realised, largely because of the increase of expenditure upon bursaries for secondary education in rural districts.<lb/>
The Department now propose to revise, with some modifications, the former Minute which gave special relief to heavily-burdened districts, the money being now taken from the Fund which I have mentioned&#x2014;the Education (Scotland) Fund. But this must be regarded as a purely temporary measure pending a more comprehensive effort to deal with the whole question of relief of local taxation. This Minute, which, let, me remind your Lordships, must have the approval of Parliament, or at least must be submitted to Parliament, will apply to heavily-rated districts in general wherever situated, but no doubt under it South Uist will obtain a substantial measure of relief. The relief will be exactly proportioned to the money raised from rates in respect of the year ended May 15, 1910. The greater the sum paid from rates in respect to that year, the less necessity will there be to levy any exceptional rate in respect to the current year. In the meantime I hope I have shown that the education difficulty in South Uist has been seriously exaggerated, and that the greater part, of the difficulty is due not to any action by the Congested Districts Board, but to other causes. The demand notes have been issued, and I trust that the rates will be paid in full. Payment in full now will not reduce the amount of relief which will ultimately be obtained from the operation of the Minute which I have mentioned. Whether the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0263"/>
<col>517</col>/
full amount of the present rate is paid now or later is as broad as it is long, but to reduce the sum to be paid now for last year is simply to increase liability which will have to be met in the succeeding year.<lb/>
The noble Lords who have taken part in this debate mentioned many points of detail, to which I think your Lordships will not expect me to allude. Indeed, I must apologise for having been obliged to lay before you so many figures and so much detail in regard to this comparatively small matter, though it is a matter of very great importance to those whom it concerns. This is just an illustration of the fallacy of taking these parishes as indicative of the conditions prevailing throughout Scotland, and even throughout the crofter districts of Scotland. There was a vein of hostility running through the whole of Lord Camperdown's speech upon the crofter system. He never allowed an opportunity to pass without an inference or an implication that the crofter system was a bad system and ought to be brought to an end as soon as possible; and the noble Lord, Lord Clinton, seemed to <i>suggest</i> that the operations of the Congested Districts Board were of an eleemosynary nature and were making great havoc with the morale and character of the crofter population of Scotland. That has often been said during these discussions. It is not yet realised that there is as wide a difference between the crofter of the west coast and the crofter of the east coast as there is between the crofter of the west coast and the farmer of the south, and I trust that there will be no support for the general and sweeping charges that were suggested by the noble Earl against the whole crofter system.<lb/>
It is not the case, as the noble Lord suggests, that the crofters of Scotland are as a body either a helpless or a hopeless population. Proprietors who have spoken to me of their crofter tenants have told me that they are the best paying tenants on their properties. And considering that there are between 21,000 and 25,000 statutory crofters, and that the very large proportion of them are men who pay their way and bring up their families and do well in the world, it is to adopt an altogether erroneous view of what the crofter is and what the crofter will be capable of, to accept the description of him which has been vouchsafed this evening. These
<col>518</col>
crofters are the backbone of the Highlands, and those who speak of them in a derogatory way or who describe their condition as hopeless do not remember the condition of the Highlands some twenty-five years ago. You may look in the Reports of the Crofters Commission, who perambulate the Highlands in the discharge of their duties, and in every Report you will see the most gratifying indications, of an improvement in the well-being and the prosperity of the crofter population. Their houses are being improved, their conditions are being improved, and it is undoubtedly an illustration of the advantage of security of tenure and of fair rent that so much progress in the crofter population should have taken place. I do not think there was any other point raised in the speeches which have been made. But if further information is desired by your Lordships on any point in connection with this Report. I shall be glad to endeavour to give it.</membercontribution></p>

Moreover, my noble friend Lord Clinton, in the course of what seemed to me to be a most admirable speech, expressed so ably the views which occur, I think, to most reasonable persons with regard to this crofter problem, that I may well spare myself and your Lordships the trouble of recapitulating them. I thought the noble Lord who speaks for the Scottish Office was rather unfair to my noble friend Lord Camperdown, when he taxed him just now with having made a speech which amounted to what I think he called a sweeping charge against. the Scottish crofters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01495"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Against the crofter system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01496"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that was at all the object of my noble friend. I, at any rate, do not bear any part in any such charge. What my noble friend did was to call the attention of the House to certain recent operations of the Congested Districts Board, and I must say I think that the facts which my noble friend laid before the House amply justified him in the course which he adopted. The noble Lord opposite suggested that things might have happened differently if the Congested Districts Board had been otherwise constituted
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0264"/>
<col>519</col>
and he said that there would have been a reconstitution of the Board had it not been for the action of this House. I confess I do not see that that observation really has much bearing on the case before us. We have no reason to believe that the policy of the present Board is one which is repudiated by His Majesty's Ministers, or that a reconstituted Board would have dealt differently with the problem before them. My noble friend's picture of the condition of things which obtains in some of these districts was a most alarming one. Summed up in half a dozen words, what he had to tell us was that within those particular districts there was insolvency, contempt for the law, and failure on the part of His Majesty's Government to enforce the law. That summarises in half a dozen words the indictment, if it be one, of my noble friend.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite did not, I think, unless perhaps quite at tae conclusion of his speech, give us much hope that this condition of things was likely to be much improved. He was not able to tell us that the particular tenants whose cases my noble friend cited were likely to pass from a condition of insolvency to a condition of solvency. He was not able to tell us that the instalments of capital which were due from them were likely to be repaid. He did not hold out, as far as I understood him, any prospect that these people really would, by the action of the Congested Districts Board, be turned into a thriving and self-supporting community. The noble Lord seemed to me to be under a rather mistaken view of what really constitutes the relief of congestion, because he dwelt with great pride on the case of the island of Vatersay, which he said. not long ago was inhabited by two families numbering perhaps ten people but upon which there were now 150 people. That does not to my mind prove the case at all. The question is whether these 150 people are likely to be a self-supporting and economically-constituted community. My noble friend's point is this, that in your well-intentioned efforts to relieve congestion you really may be creating congestion.<lb/>
Let me say that I, for one, cordially welcome the attempts of the Congested Districts Board to improve the condition of these poor people, and I should certainly not condemn the Board merely because in the initial stages of these transactions public
<col>520</col>
money was generously spent by them perhaps without very much prospect of the whole of it coming back to the public pocket. But there is all the difference in the world between such initial generosity and the perpetuation of a state of things under which these people will become a chronic drain either upon the public purse or upon the purse of the ratepayers. The noble Earl told us a great deal that certainly created in my mind the impression that in some of these cases, at any rate, the operations of the Board had been not only extravagant but unsuccessful. The fact is that the creation of small holdings, no matter in what part of the United Kingdom, cannot be successfully carried out unless those conditions which Lord Clinton so well described are present&#x2014;that is to say, a suitable soil, a suitable climate, and a population inclined to thrift and agriculture&#x2014;conditions which would enable these people to profit permanently by your beneficence at the outset.<lb/>
The danger of dealing rashly with these questions is that, while you may or may not relieve those persons for whose benefit these schemes are undertaken, you may create great hardship and injustice to others. You create great hardship, for example, it seems to me, upon those owners of land who are virtually compelled to surrender their property and to cut it up for conversion into what we should describe in Ireland as uneconomic holdings. You create a great hardship upon the ratepayers, whose burden is already a heavy one and who see that burden increased by these processes. The noble Lord when he was dealing with Lord Camperdown's statement as to the expenditure on schools, said "Oh, that was not the fault of the Congested Districts Board; it was the fault of the local authorities." But I take it that if a number of heads of families with their children are planted down upon one of these islands it is the bounden duty of the local authorities to provide a school for their children, and the increase in the school expenditure and in the school rate follows automatically upon the action of the Board. That is inseparable from the transaction.<lb/>
My Lords, I will only say before I sit down that I earnestly hope the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland will bear in mind the suggestions which have been laid before him to-night, and that when he comes to deal
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0265"/>
<col>521</col>
next year, as we understand he intends to do, with further measures affecting the position of these crofters, he will at any rate remember that there are considerable interests at stake, and that mistaken generosity may be in the end not only very injurious to other classes of the community, but even to the very class for whose benefit it is intended.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01497"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will only trouble your Lordships with a word or two in reply. I am afraid I failed to convey to the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland the meaning of my Motion. My Motion did not refer to the crofter system as a whole. Every remark I made referred to crofters in the Western Islands, and all that part of the noble Lord's speech which was bestowed to the general crofter system may, if I may say so respectfully, be regarded as wholly out of place. The case I put to the noble Lord was this. I asked, "Have the Government settlements in the Western Islands succeeded?" and I adduced a number of facts which I do not think were ever contested. And going further I asked, "Have settlements which have been made by private proprietors succeeded?" I mentioned all those that I knew, and submitted to your Lordships that there was no proof whatever that they were succeeding, and that such proof as there was went entirely in the other direction. Then the noble Lord said to me "Do you disapprove of our purchasing Vatersay?" No, I highly approve of it, and, as he said, I advocated it. Then he asked, "Do you disapprove of our giving Lady Cathcart a fair price for Vatersay?" No, my Lords, I do not at all disapprove of that. On the contrary, I should have replied in rather uncomplimentary terms possibly to the noble Lord if he had done otherwise. What I did say was this&#x2014;it was merely a remark in passing&#x2014;what a strange thing it was that the nobleLord, having for two or three years entirely refused to have anything to do with the purchase of Vatersay, should all of a sudden turn round and for some reason, which I think I can guess at but which is hidden from public cognisance, reverse his whole policy and purchase Vatersay. That is what I intended to animadvert upon, and I must say it still occasions me considerable surprise.<lb/>
Then when the noble Lord came to the question of relief he said that your Lordships must remember that these islands have received considerable relief under the Old
<col>522</col>
Age Pensions Act. Does he not see what a satire that is on the principle of crofters' settlements in the Western Islands? He says, "As soon as my crofters become seventy years of age they are people who require 5<i>s</i>. a week, because they have got nothing." He puts that argument to us, but it bears entirely the other way. Then he says the school board and the parish council are strongly to blame because they went to law with each other. How could they help it? The law says that the school board is to demand the sum which it thinks necessary for the educational requirements of the parish. The school board demanded &#x00A3;1,600, and the parish council said it was impossible to levy that sum. The noble Lord says, "Oh, but why could not they make a settlement by agreement?" When you have a sum to levy you must either levy it or not levy it. As for saying it is possible to agree, that is just one of those inconclusive arrangements and settlements which the noble Lord is always advocating, and I must confess that it appears to me to be one of the chief reasons why he so constantly finds himself in trouble.<lb/>
With regard to the &#x00A3;1,600, I simply say, Divide the &#x00A3;1,600 into any number of shillings and sixpences, or anything else, &#x00A3;1,600 is &#x00A3;1,600, and it has to be levied, and to be levied on a rental of &#x00A3;6,000 a year. When the noble Lord spoke about school rates he had the most airy ideas. He spoke of a rate of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., and so on, as if it was nothing. I wonder what his ideas about squatters and school rates really are. I mentioned a great many individual cases, but the noble Lord, in the course of his reply, never alluded to one of them. He never attempted to say that these squatters at Vatersay had not bested him. My Lords, they have; and there they will remain. With regard to the rest of the speech of the noble Lord, I think at this late hour it would not do for me to occupy your Lordships' time in further remarks. I beg to withdraw the Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01500">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01501"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I do not detain your Lordships at any length in moving the Second Reading of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0266"/>
<col>523</col>
this Bill, I am sure you will not think that it is due to any failure on my part to appreciate the importance and urgency of the subject with which it attempts to deal, but because of the fact that only last year I had the honour of passing through your Lordships' House a Bill on this subject of which this is a copy. Therefore I need not this evening go at any length into the arguments in favour of some change in the law. It has always been felt by members of the Church of England that the Bishop is necessarily the head of all spiritual work and organisation in his diocese, and from time to time attempts have been made, some within our own time, to add to the facility with which that work may be performed by subdividing the dioceses which have outgrown the power of any one man to cope with owing to the growth of population in this country. Nine such dioceses have been established within the last thirty or forty years, I believe.<lb/>
It may be asked why cannot we be content to go on with the existing law, or why it is necessary to alter the law in order to facilitate the creation of new Bishoprics where such Bishoprics are required. Any one who has considered this subject at all and examined the present position of the Church of England must be alive to the fact that not a few of the existing dioceses have quite outgrown the capacity of any one man to deal with. It is not too much to say that men of the highest capacity and ability are completely overwhelmed at the present moment in some of these dioceses by the mere machinery of organisation and jurisdiction, and have absolutely no time whatever to attend to that pastoral and personal work which is, perhaps, after all, the best work which falls to the hand of any right rev. Prelate in this country.<lb/>
Under the present law it requires legislation not merely to establish a new Bishopric, but even to alter the boundaries of a Bishopric or to interfere in any way with the income of an existing Bishop. When I represented Bristol in the House of Commons I naturally took great interest in the foundation of the new Bishopric of Bristol. I think I was responsible for the Act which established the Bishopric; but when that was clone it was found necessary to alter the boundaries of the diocese. That required a new Act; and in the third year it was considered advisable that the contribution from the income of the Bishop of Gloucester
<col>524</col>
and Bristol should be somewhat larger than the contribution which had been laid down in the original Act. That required a third Bill to carry it into effect. I had the greatest difficulty, though all these Bills were practically unopposed, in carrying them through the House of Commons because, owing to the arrangement of business in that House, any one member could practically stop the progress of a Bill of the kind. Only last session when a very strong case indeed was made before the House of Commons for the establishment of a Bishopric of Sheffield, though that Bill obtained very general assent, it was found impossible, for reasons of the kind to which I have alluded, to pass it into law.<lb/>
There is another reason why the present system requires amendment. When legislation has to be of the present fragmentary character merely for the constitution of a single Bishopric, it is impossible that a general scheme may be thought out and supported in the country which would be greatly to the advantage of the Church of England by a proper subdivision of many existing dioceses. Therefore the proposals of this Bill are simply these, that in future it may be lawful for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, with the assent of the Archbishop of the Province and the Bishop of any diocese affected, to present to the Privy Council a draft Order in Council for the constitution of one or more new Bishoprics, which draft Order shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament. The funds must necessarily be provided by the subscriptions of members of the Church of England, or by some deduction from the income of any existing Bishopric on the first vacancy. Nothing can be taken under this Bill from the common fund of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for the establishment of a Bishopric. The Bill proposes that the draft Order should lie on the Table of each House of Parliament for thirty days, and if during that time any objection is taken by either House, no further procedure can be taken under the Order, and the matter has to be remitted for fresh consideration to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Then there is another proposal in the Bill for the establishment in a similar way of deans and chapters in eight of the nine new dioceses which have been founded in recent years a d in the new dioceses to be subsequently founded; and further, for an amendment of the Bishops Resignation Act, 1869, which stereotypes the provision of pensions<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0267"/>
<col>525</col>
The Bill provides that by an Order in Council the pension may be fixed at whatever sum may be considered right., subject, of course, to the existing interest of the present incumbents.<lb/>
Those are the simple provisions of this Bill, and in proof of the necessity for them I may, in a few sentences, tell your Lordships what. would be possible within about a year of its passing, if it should become law in the present year. First of all, the great. diocese of York, containing two millions of population, could be divided by the establishment of a Bishopric of Sheffield, which has a population of 840,000, and, I believe, practically the whole of the sum necessary for the establishment of a Bishopric of Sheffield has been already subscribed. Then the diocese of St. Albans, containing a population of 1,336,000, 630 benefices, and 1,050 clergy; the diocese of Ely, extending over three and a-half counties, and with 763 clergy; and the diocese of Norwich, which now contains both the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, with 890 benefices and 1,000 clergy&#x2014;these could be divided by the establishment of two new Bishoprics, one for Suffolk and one for Essex. I believe that everything necessary has been already subscribed in Hertfordshire and Essex, and nearly all in Suffolk; and the subscriptions have come in not merely from wealthy members of the Church but from a very large number of Churchmen within the dioceses that I have named. That is only one of the schemes that could be carried out if Parliament would enable the powers to be conferred on the Privy Council which I have proposed in this Bill. I do not know that it is necessary for me to say anything more in commendation of the Bill to your Lordships, because last year it was passed without the faintest opposition, and therefore I hope I need not detain you longer in moving the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01503"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to enter a caveat with regard to this Bill. I have no objection to the general principle embodied in the speech of the noble Viscount. My point is that in legislating you ought not to invade private rights beyond what is necessary in order to give effect to the purpose of the Bill. I wish to call attention to the proposal in this Bill,
<col>526</col>
which is quite a new one, to take away compulsorily the rights of patronage, merely paying the patron compensation for the loss. That was not found to be at all necessary in the recent Acts which created the Bishoprics of Newcastle, Liverpool, and Wakefield, and later the Bishoprics of Southwark and Birmingham. You do not alway compensate a patron by paying him compensation, because he has an interest in connection with the appointment of the minister to the church; and in several cases where it was wished to create a new Bishopric the church that might, owing to its antiquity and dignity, be selected as the cathedral, might be in the hands of a patron who would be extremely indignant at being deprived of his patronage. When creating Bishoprics I feel it I o be very desirable that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners should, as far as is compatible, have a free hand, but I see no necessity for this invasion of the rights of patrons, and patrons who take a great interest in their patronage will be very jealous of their rights. To take the case of Keble College, for instance, which enjoys a valuable trust for making appointments, they would not like to have that power taken from them.</membercontribution></p>

There is one other point that I should like to have cleared up. There is no provision in this Bill expressly stating that the patronage of these deans and chapters if they are created should be in the Crown. But that is a small point. I conclude by repeating that I think this is an unnecessary invasion of the rights of patronage and that the point should be dealt with at the next stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01506"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am satisfied that the merits of the Bill, together with the extremely lucid speech of the noble Viscount, will be sufficient to secure its Second Reading at your Lordships' hands. I regret that my most rev. brother the Archbishop of Canterbury is unable to be present owing to indisposition. He would have wished to testify to his sense of the importance of this measure. I cannot think that the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0268"/>
<col>527</col>
observations which have just fallen from the noble Lord are likely to affect in any way your Lordships' desire to give a Second Reading to the Bill. The point that he mentioned is arguable, and one which may well be discussed in Committee. It only touches, if he will forgive my saying so, in the most fractional way the really important and vital matter which is submitted to your Lordships' House. At this late hour it is quite unnecessary for me to speak at any length on the importance of the matter, but it affects vitally the efficiency of the Church of England. The Bishoprics Bill may sound a simple and uninspiring thing, but that is really what is at stake. If the Church of England has a work to do it is worth while that it should be able to do it well, and whether or not it is to do it well depends upon the reality, the vigour, the efficiency of this diocesan system.<lb/>
The noble Viscount was entirely within the mark when he said that owing to the growth of the population, owing, perhaps, quite as much to the complexity of the problems with which the Church of England has to deal, and, happily, to the growth of the standard of work which the Church of England is expected to fulfil, there are many dioceses at the present time in England in which it is impossible for the Bishop with the best will in the world, to fulfil his office adequately. It is a difficulty which affects him both in the paternal and in the disciplinary aspects of his work. If he is to be an overseer in point of discipline it is at least necessary that he should see, and if he is to be a father among the people it is necessary that he should be seen. Neither of these conditions can at present be properly fulfilled in many cases. I say nothing of the effect of the present system upon the health of Bishops; that is comparatively a minor matter. I think more might be said of the difficulty of securing in this burden of administrative detail the time necessary for thought and reading, which are essential to any one who is called upon to occupy the position of a Bishop. I would urge that it is a matter which concerns not only the Bishops and the Clergy but the people themselves. Happily there is everywhere a growth of corporate spirit, and that corporate spirit depends for its vitality upon the presence in the midst of the people of a Bishop who is something more than a dignitary appearing at intervals on some ceremonial occasion.<lb/>
<col>528</col>
I can speak from personal experience, both of the need of the creation of new Bishoprics and of the inadequacy of the present method of procedure. As the noble Viscount has reminded your Lordships, my own huge and unwieldy diocese cries out for subdivision. It is quite impossible for me, even with the aid of that inestimable diocesan agent the motor-car, to undertake the supervision of a population of nearly two millions of people, of 660 benefices, and more than 1,000 clergy, and of an area 100 miles long and forty-five broad, together with all the duties that belong to my office as the Archbishop of the Province. It is proposed, as the noble Viscount said, to create a diocese in Sheffield. No one objects to it in Yorkshire. Every one is cordially in favour of it, even the Nonconformists. At the first meeting a Nonconformist Lord Mayor was in the chair, and he has taken the most active interest in the question ever since. From first to last I have scarcely heard of any objection from any one on the spot. The proposed diocese satisfies all the necessary conditions. It contains a homogeneous population of manufacturing and coal producing people, and it has an obvious and proper centre in the great city of Sheffield. The money has been generously subscribed; &#x00A3;50,000 is required, of which &#x00A3;40,000 practically has already been subscribed. It is only in another place that any difficulty has occurred. Here is the need for a separate diocese, and the means provided by which a separate diocese can be formed. When I speak of the means I ought to mention that &#x00A3;1,000 a year is to be taken from the income of the Archdiocese of York. The Archbishop himself and the people are not only agreed that the thing should take place, but are themselves subscribing the money by which it can be realised.<lb/>
Now I come to the inadequacy of the present system of procedure. We introduced a separate Sheffield Bishopric Bill in another place. There was everything in its favour. His Majesty's Government expressed their desire that it should pass; the ballot was favourable; the course of the Bill was as easy as could be expected; but at the last moment it fell a victim to the risks and pitfalls inevitable to the passing of a private Bill through the House of Commons. The effect of that failure has, of course, been extraordinarily depressing upon those who have subscribed such a large sum of money. But it is worse
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0269"/>
<col>529</col>
than that. It means that until such a Bill can get through Parliament the whole Church life and work of that district is arrested. New beginnings are impossible, and until the Bill passes there is inevitable stagnation. In these circumstances I think it is not too much to ask that facilities should be offered to enable these new Bishoprics to be created without the tedium and uncertainty and the general paralysis of the work of the Church which ensue upon the present position. I will not at this hour even venture to anticipate objections that can be brought. I do not think that in this House they will be brought at all on any question of principle. The principle is obvious; the need is urgent in many places. There are at the present moment, as the noble Viscount has said this evening, three Bishoprics already needed and waiting to be created&#x2014;Sheffield, Essex, and Suffolk; and where there is no principle that can be questioned, and where no public money is involved, not even from the common fund of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and. where no living soul suffers any grievance whatever, our plea is that the administration should be rendered as simple as the principle is sound and the need urgent.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01511"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is a rather rare instance of a measure which, I think, in its contents
<col>530</col>
and substance fully commands the assent of all Parties in this House and in another place; yet it is one which it is most devoutly hoped will never come into operation. We, I believe, should all agree, if the deplorable event should occur which should make the appointment of a Regent necessary, that Her Majesty Queen Mary is the person upon whom the choice of the nation would unanimously fall, not only owing to the fact that the mother of a young Sovereign is obviously the person to whom in his inexperienced years he should look for counsel and support, but also owing to the character and attainments of Her. Majesty herself. The Bill, except in one trivial respect, follows the course indicated by precedent. After nominating Her Majesty Queen Mary as Regent, it states that she would be called 'upon to take certain oaths of office. It provides that the marriage of the Sovereign during the Regency is forbidden without the consent of the Regent in writing, and the assent of both Houses of Parliament; and provision is also made that if the Regent should become reconciled to the Church of Rome, or should marry a person professing the Roman Catholic religion, or should absent herself, except temporarily, from the Kingdom, her office should cease.<lb/>
The only clause to which I need draw special attention is Clause 4, which provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Regent shall not give or have power to give the Royal Assent to any Bill for repealing, changing, or in any respect varying, the order or course of succession to the Crown of this realm, as established by the Act of Settlement, or to any Bill for repealing or altering an Act of the fifth year of the reign of Queen Anne, made in Scotland, intituled ' An Act for securing the Protestant religion and Presbyterian government.'"</quote>
As the Bill was originally introduced in another place the clause contained a safeguard against the altering of the Act of Uniformity. In the course of the debate in another place, the general sense of the House being taken, the provision as regards the Act of Uniformity and also as regards the Act of Queen Anne relating to Scotland were taken out of the Bill. That fact caused the noble Lord, Lord Balfour, when the question of this Bill came before the House some time ago, to announce that he would enter a protest. Now, however, the noble Lord, I am sure, will be satisfied with the form that both the Bill and its Schedule have taken. As regards the Act of Uni-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0270"/>
<col>531</col>
formity, I gather that little or no protest was made in another place at the omission of the words safeguarding that. Act, and some reasons were adduced why it would be more convenient that it should not be expressly included. The point, I think, is a very small one, and I do not anticipate that any of your Lordships would desire to re-introduce the words relating to that Act on this occasion. It only remains for me to ask your Lordships to read the Bill a second time.</membercontribution></p>

We feel that the Government have been well advised, in the lamentable possibility which we do not. care to contemplate, in naming Her Majesty Queen Mary as the Regent who should bear the grave responsibility which would then fall upon that office.<lb/>
I only rose to mention that there appears o be one small omission at the end of Clause 5, upon which I shall offer an Amendment when the Bill gets into Committee. I do not desire to detain your Lordships upon it now, beyond pointing out that in the possibility contemplated under Clause 5&#x2014;a remote and almost. absurd possibility&#x2014;of providing for another Regent, the Government have not provided any Regent to take Queen Mary's place.

<col>542</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01622"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have handed in two or three Amendments, and I regret that your Lordships did not have them circulated. It was impossible, the Bill only having been read a second time last night, that I could get them in earlier. My first Amendment is to subsection (1) and is to leave out the words which appear in the subsection in parentheses&#x2014;namely, "notwithstanding any enactments to the contrary"&#x2014;and to insert "with the consent of the patron or patrons." I said last night that it was quite a. new departure to deprive a patron of his right of presentation irrespective of his consent. In previous Acts for creating new Bishoprics there was in each case a clause protecting the rights of patrons. The provision in this Bill, therefore, is not the least essential to the purposes of the Bill, because all previous Bishoprics have been created without this provision.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships of the danger of introducing provisions which constitute a serious evasion of legal rights unless those evasions are necessary for some public purpose. As undoubtedly the creation of new Bishoprics can perfectly well be performed without depriving the patron of his rights, I see no reason why this should be put into the present Bill. Of the parish church which was selected as the Cathedral of Liverpool the Rev. Stephen Gladstone was the patron. I can very well imagine that there might have been a very distinct divergence of opinion between the late Bishop and the Gladstone family; and I think it is very hard that people who have strong opinions on these church matters and have a presentation should be deprived of that in the way proposed in this Bill. Your Lordships will notice that further on in the Bill there is a proposal that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners should determine the value of the compensation to be paid to the patron if he demands compensation. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners can be said to be the promoters of these Bishoprics, and to make the persons who are the promoters the judges of the compensation seems to me very undesirable. When dealing with Bills which had reference to Irish land your Lordships felt very strongly that the public body, whether it was the Congested Districts Board or any other body, which was interested in acquiring the land, was not the proper body to determine the price to be paid for the land, and you did secure that it should be the Judicial Commissioner who
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0276"/>
<col>543</col>
should determine the price of the land in that case.<lb/>
But for the moment I am pressing the more important point&#x2014;namely, that the patron ought not to be deprived of his right unless it is absolutely necessary, which it is not, for the creation of the Bishopric. I am quite sure that if any one of your Lordships were the patron of either of those magnificent churches I mentioned last night and took an interest in ecclesiastical matters, you would feel that no money compensation bearing any relation to the pecuniary value of the living would be any recompense to you for being deprived of that important trust. I feel very strongly that if you adopt this principle of going beyond the purposes of the Bill it will be quoted against you, and you will be establishing a precedent which will be used in cases in which you might very much resent it.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Clause 1, page 1, lines 17 and 18, leave out ("notwithstanding any enactments to the contrary") and insert ("with the consent of the "patron or patrons")&#x2014;(<i>Lord Sheffield.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01624"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will not give your assent to this Amendment. The noble Lord has contended that the provision of schemes for the creation of deans and chapters in connection with the Cathedral church is foreign to the main purpose of the Bill. That, I think, can hardly be maintained in view of the fact that a Cathedral church is an essential part of the Bishopric. The Bishop must have his Cathedral church, and it is a matter of great importance not so much to himself as to the working of the whole diocese, where that Cathedral church is situated. Your Lordships will readily understand that it is a matter of great importance that the church selected as the Cathedral of the diocese should be one whose general management would be in harmony with the views, not of any particular section of church people in the diocese, but of the whole diocese itself. The noble Lord has quoted instances in which churches that might be used as Cathedrals have been acquired by trustees or by private patrons who might be very unwilling to part with the patronage. I imagine that in a number of cases the trustees and the patron would be most willing, for the sake of the future of the
<col>544</col>
diocese, to part with their patronage. If it is for the good of the diocese as a whole that there should be a Bishop, then I think it is equally for the good of the diocese that the patronage of the Cathedral church and the deanery within it and the chapter should be in public hands.<lb/>
I am rather surprised that the noble Lord should have introduced this Amendment, because I am informed that the section which provides for the compensation of patrons who are thus asked to surrender their rights for the good of the Church as a whole was introduced in order to meet the views which he on a previous occasion had expressed. As to his claim that the provision of compensation is inadequate because the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are themselves the promoters of these schemes, I think he has there made a mistake. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners are not the promoters of these schemes. They are rather the judges of their adequacy. It is not the business of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to promote schemes for the formation of new Bishoprics, but to satisfy themselves that in point of adequate endowment and other essential matters these are schemes which ought to be submitted to the Privy Council and laid before Parliament. Therefore, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seem to me not to be in the least. in the position indicated by the noble Lord just now. I can imagine no better body than the Commissioners to judge fairly as to the compensation which ought to be asked.<lb/>
In previous Bishopric Bills no provision has been made for the compensation of patrons. This clause is entirely new, in order to meet the difficulty of the patrons to whom the noble Lord has called attention. In view of the fact that it is of great importance that the Cathedral church of the diocese should be as far as possible a church under the control of public patrons and not under the control of private patrons, I venture to express the hope that your Lordships will not accept the Amendment. I end by saying that this is not a difficulty, I think, that will in many cases arise. My own experience is that arrangements can probably be made, by the exchange of patronage or otherwise, which would render it unnecessary in every case to resort to the expedient of compelling a patron to give up his patronage. In
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0277"/>
<col>545</col>
most cases it could be clone by a friendly arrangement; but if it came to the point of a decision having to be made I think it should be made in the direction of giving the control of the church to public patronage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01625"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether it is necessary for me to add anything to what has been so well placed before your Lordships by the most rev. Primate, but as the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment had some communication with me on the subject last year, perhaps I may venture to say that I did not agree to the insertion of this provision in the Bill without feeling perfectly certain that it was a necessary provision or might become so in some cases that might arise. After all, it is not so much the Bishop who selects the Cathedral church. It is the wish of the people of the diocese. They would naturally wish that the finest church in the diocese should be chosen. For instance, if a new diocese was to be set up, and, say, Bath Abbey was to be chosen, it might lead to conflict if it were impossible, by exchange or by some procedure under this Bill, to obtain the patronage of what everybody would wish to be the Cathedral church of the diocese. I hope the noble Lord will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01626"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would point out that the fact of getting the living under public patronage was not considered at all necessary in the past. The most rev. Primate and the noble Viscount have said that it would be very rare that this provision would be required. If it would be very rarely used, why not adhere to the law as it stands at the present time, which requires the consent of the patron?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01627"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no doubt that it is quite possible to discover isolated cases of hardship which perhaps might arise under the provisions of the Bill as now before you. The question is whether in these circumstances we should insert an Amendment which, if I may say so, has not received much support; in fact, I think no support from any quarter of the House except from the noble Lord himself. I venture to think that your Lordships would be well advised
<col>546</col>
in leaving the Bill as it is, and leaving the remedies of the aggrieved patron to that private negotiation which, as has been pointed out, undoubtedly might take place before the Order was submitted to the Privy Council. I think the demand of the patron might be well satisfied by an exchange of benefice. In the circumstances I hope your Lordships will pass the Bill without the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01628">On Question, Amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01629"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My next Amendment, which was to leave out paragraph (<i>c</i>), is substantially consequential upon the last Amendment, and therefore I do not move it. But I propose by my third Amendment to add, at the end of subsection (3), the words "but nothing in this subsection shall authorise the annexation of a benefice to a deanery without the consent of the patron or patrons." I read this subsection as giving the authorities power to go back, in the case of dioceses which have been already formed, and reopen the arrangements there. It would enable the authorities to say to a patron who had had his right reserved under the law by which the Bishopric was founded, "We will go back on that and claim your advowson." If I am right in that, it is a very strong measure to introduce into this Bill a clause which would enable a settlement which had been come to in a diocese founded for several years to be disturbed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01631"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: The point is a new one to me. I cannot say offhand whether the noble Lord is right or wrong, and I am not quite sure that I appreciate his point. Is it that he thinks that where an Act has already authorised the creation of a Bishopric and under the provisions of that Act certain arrangements have been made with reference to deans and chapters, this Bill would enable those arrangements made under the provisions of an old Act to be reopened? Is that his view?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01632"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: Not exactly. As I read subsection (3) there would be power,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0278"/>
<col>547</col>
where the Statute creating the Bishopric, reserved to the patron all his rights, to enter upon what is practically an old and established Bishopric and to say to the patron, "We now propose to take away your patronage in order to turn the incumbent into a dean." But if the point is a new one to the noble Viscount, I will withdraw the Amendment at this stage, and ask him to consult those who drafted the Bill between now and the Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01633">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01634"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My final Amendment is to insert a new subsection at the end of the clause. I understood that it was contemplated that a dean would be in the appointment of the Crown, and it seems to me that both deans and chapters should be in the appointment of the Crown. I therefore propose to add a new subsection to that effect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01636">Clause 1, page 3, line 24, after ("order") insert the following new subsection:

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01637"><member>VISCOUNT ST.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01638"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will accept the Amendment in that form I am quite prepared to stop at the word "deans," and leave the question of canonries open.

<col>548</col>
a scheme in which it was not provided that the dean, except in one particular case, should be appointed by the Crown, and even in that excepted case it would be indirectly an appointment of the dean by the Crown. It is possible that in the case of some of these new cathedrals the Bishop might wish to be his own dean. That is the case in regard to the new Cathedral of Southwark, and it might exist elsewhere. In such a case indirectly the dean would be appointed by the Crown. I can see no objection to the statement being explicitly made that deans, when they are separate from the bishop, should be appointed by the Crown; but I would press very much that the appointment of residentiary canonries should be left open. It has happened in the case at least of one new diocese that large benefactions and endowments were made for the formation of residentiary canonries with the express stipulation that the patronage should be in the hands of the Bishop.</membercontribution></p>

An instance occurs to my mind of a Bishop who is anxious to subdivide his diocese and has selected a collegiate church to which he has appointed a number of canons and a sub-dean. When the moment arrives and the actual division takes place these people will have something of a claim to the position to which they have already acquired a titular claim. I venture to hope that for the moment, at any rate, we might find a way out on the lines suggested by the most rev.

If Her Majesty Queen Mary shall, after becoming Regent, be reconciled to or hold communion with the See or Church of Rome, or shall profess the Roman Catholic religion, or shall marry a person professing the Roman Catholic religion, or shall cease to reside in or absent herself otherwise than temporarily front the United Kingdom, Her Majesty shall no longer be guardian and Regent; and all the powers and authorities which she may have derived under or by virtue of this Act shall thenceforth cease and determine.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01663"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Earl the Leader of the House has had time to consider my Amendment since last night. The event which I contemplate is so remote, so exceedingly unlikely, that it would be almost absurd for me to detain your Lordships upon it; but the contingency provided for in Clause 5 is itself so remote and unlikely that it seems fit and proper that if we make any such enactment at all we should make it complete. It appears to me on the face of it that in the event contemplated&#x2014;namely, that the office of Regent is vacated because of the conversion of the Regent to the Roman Catholic faith or other such analogous proceeding on her part&#x2014;there would be no provision made for carrying on the Government of the country. There is, of course, also the possible case of the death of the Regent, in which a similar difficulty would arise.<lb/>
What is really suggested in this clause of the Bill is to put the Regent in a similar position to the Sovereign himself. Under the Act of Settlement, I think it is, if the Sovereign becomes a Roman Catholic the office of the Sovereign is vacated, and the object of the clause is to put the Regent in the same position but there is this difference, that in the case of the Crown Parliament has made provision for what
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0280"/>
<col>551</col>
is to be done in that event, because it is provided that it shall be treated as if the Sovereign were dead&#x2014;that is to say, the next heir to the Throne would necessarily succeed. There is, however, no similar provision if the same circumstances should happen in the case of the Regent. Therefore it certainly seems that some change is required. Moreover, we are not without some historical knowledge of the difficulties. On the first occasion when George III was incapacitated there was considerable difficulty as to how the Regent was to be appointed. I do not Mean to say you can provide for every case, and, of course, Parliament does not attempt to provide for what is to be done in the still more unlikely case of the same misfortune happening to the Sovereign as happened to George III.<lb/>
When George III was first incapacitated nobody knew what to do, and the two Parliaments&#x2014;the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland&#x2014;acted in totally different ways. The Parliament of Ireland presented a joint address to the Prince of Wales, asking him to assume the office of Regent; but the Parliament of Great Britain, on the other hand, was subject to a difference of opinion between the leaders of the two Parties at that time. As a result they could not agree to present this joint address to the Prince of Wales, and they adopted the rather remarkable device of asking the Lord Chancellor to affix the Great Seal to an Address&#x2014;I think it was from this House &#x2014;to the Prince of Wales without authority. That was done. But the fact that that Parliament was driven to such expedients as I have indicated shows how necessary it is in certain events to make provision. With these few words I venture to move the Amendment standing in my name, but I need not say that as far as the words are concerned I am entirely in the hands of His Majesty's Government, and if they agree to the Amendment but would prefer other words, I would willingly accept them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01665"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since yesterday I have had an opportunity of looking into this matter. Of course, it is one, as the noble Marquess has indicated, on which one is greatly disposed to be bound by precedent. The noble Marquess has mentioned the case of the first attack which affected King George III, and at the time of the second attack, the appointment of the Regency in 1811, a similar procedure was devised&#x2014;that is to say, authority was given for the Great Seal being put to a Commission without the Sign Manual, because the King was not in a condition to affix it, and the Commissioners were then empowered to give the Royal Assent to the Regency Bill. Of course, that is not what the noble Marquess proposes in this instance. He proposes that it shall be lawful for both Houses to present an Address to the Sovereign praying that a person named in such Address may be appointed Regent.<lb/>
On the general question I confess that I am in agreement with what was laid down by those who were formerly responsible in some of these cases, that it is inadvisable to attempt to provide for all possible contingencies and that as much as possible should be left to the Parliament which at some future time may conceivably have to deal with it. In 1840, when the Regency Bill was introduced a somewhat similar proposition was made in another place, and Sir Robert Peel said that in his view nothing was so unwise as to go beyond the necessity of the case by attempting to foresee every contingency that could arise, and to tie up the hands of future Parliaments by making provisions for remote contingencies such as the demise of the Regent, and he thought it would be much better provided for by the Parliament in being at the time when the necessity arose. I understand that the noble Marquess would not quarrel with that statement, because in a sense that is what he proposes to do; but, on the other hand, I think I can persuade him that the procedure which he proposes is not necessary. There is no reason, I am given to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0281"/>
<col>553</col>
understand, should such an unfortunate contingency arise, either that contemplated under Clause 5 of the Bill or that of the demise of the Regent., why Parliament should not proceed as it is proceeding now, by Bill. There is no difficulty in the Royal Assent being given by a Sovereign at any time. It can be given by a Sovereign from his or her cradle; and that being so, I think it is on the whole desirable not to introduce the more or less novel procedure suggested by the noble Marquess, but to leave the future Parliament to deal with the question, should necessity arise, by the ordinary method of procedure by Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I understand from him that he is advised, on the best authority, that there is no difficulty in obtaining the Royal Assent from a Sovereign, still being an infant, if the case which he and I are bound to contemplate for the purposes of this discussion should really arise. If he is quite satisfied that there is no difficulty in having a valid assent from a Sovereign, being a minor, in the event contemplated, there would be no difficulty at all.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01675"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> had given notice, on the Order for the Second Reading being read, to move that the consideration of the Bill be postponed until after the autumn recess. The noble Earl said: My Lords, the Motion which I wish to submit to your Lordships has nothing
<col>554</col>
to do with the merits of the Bill, and therefore I will not go into them any further than to say that the Bill effects, as I am sure every one will agree, a considerable change in the law. The objection which I take to proceeding with the Second Reading now is on behalf of the general liberties of the House. We have on frequent occasions objected very strongly to the indecorous, as we thought, and almost indecent way in which Bills were rushed upon this House. This Bill, I must say, appears to me to sin in this direction to a very remarkable degree. It is not as if we were within three or four days of the end of the session. I very much wish we were, but, as that contingency has not arisen, what I want to know is the reason why this Bill is forced upon the House with such insufficient notice. This Bill was only ordered to be printed on July 21. I do not know whether other members of your Lordships' House may have received it, but I do not think I received my copy until Tuesday, certainly not until Monday. As I understand, His Majesty's Government wish to press this Bill with the intention of passing it through all its stages here before we adjourn. Is that so?</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01676"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: We will answer that in clue course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01677"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl in charge of the Bill tell me whether I am correct in imagining that it is proposed to pass this Bill through all its stages in this House before we adjourn for the recess?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01679"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Earl's pardon. If it is inconvenient I will withdraw the question. The Bill, as I have said, was circulated on Monday of this week. It is an important Bill and effects an important change in the law. Why are we to be called upon to proceed with this Bill at once? What necessity is there for hurry? We shall meet in November, and, as I understand, we shall probably have nothing to do when we first meet, and there will be ample time to consider the Bill in an orderly and decent manner. It is not even as
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0282"/>
<col>555</col>
if this Bill had passed through your Lordships' House on previous occasions. It is not even as if it had passed through the other House of Parliament. It is a Bill introduced here for the first time. I believe it was introduced by the Government in the other House on two occasions, but was not proceeded with on either occasion; and so far as this House is concerned it is an entirely novel Bill. I think I have made my objection pretty plain to your Lordships, and I do not think it necessary to trouble you, at all events just now, with any further remarks. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01681"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will at once reply to the question which was addressed to me by the noble Earl in the course of his remarks. It was difficult at the beginning of the noble Earl's observations to give him a definite answer, because the course which His Majesty's Government will take on an occasion like this must necessarily very largely depend upon the sentiment of your Lordships' House and the opinions which are expressed in various quarters of the House, and I do not think it would have been altogether respectful to your Lordships if we had at once definitely answered the noble Earl either in the affirmative or the negative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01682"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01683"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: And perhaps the noble Earl underrates the effect of his own arguments. We might have wished to proceed at once with the Bill, but we might have been persuaded by the arguments of the noble Earl to postpone its consideration. I will confine myself to discussing the Motion now before the House. It is, I think, somewhat unusual that we should discuss a proposal of this kind before the Second Reading has been moved, but it is consequent upon a Standing Order that this Motion in the form moved by the noble Earl must be taken first. May I point out that we are not acting without precedent in this matter? Other Bills were introduced almost at the same time, I think, as this Bill, and your Lordships do not seem to object to passing those Bills without greater time for consideration. The
<col>556</col>
noble Earl omitted to point out that a Bill very similar, though I think with a different title but with the same object, has been introduced into the other House on a previous occasion, and was there read a second time by a majority of two to one. It was introduced again in the following year, and was supported strongly on both sides of the House and passed without a Division. It was carried through Grand Committee, but although brought forward again in the House it never got beyond the First Reading stage. Therefore the matter is not so entirely new as might appear. At any rate the Bill has been on previous occasions before Parliament. It is, therefore, within the cognisance of members of your Lordships' House at any rate who might then have been sitting in another place, and consequently cannot be described as being a wholly new question. In these circumstances I venture to hope that your Lordships will allow the Bill to be proceeded with this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01684"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think the House can have been surprised that my noble friend behind me should have urged that we were entitled to be given adequate time in which to consider and discuss the provisions of this Bill. It is an important Bill, and it contains certainly a number of highly controversial propositions. My noble friend is correct in saying that it has only been a. very few days before us, and that we have, therefore, not bad full opportunity of examining it. I am not convinced by the noble Earl's argument that the fact of this Bill having been before the House of Commons for some time is of itself sufficient to induce us to dispense with those opportunities of debate which we should otherwise be entitled to insist upon. But my noble friend, I observed, insisted in his argument mainly on the point, that he had been given to understand that His Majesty's Government desired to pass this Bill through all its stages during the few days that remain between to-night and the adjournment for the holidays. I am not aware whether that is so, but I think the noble Earl opposite was fully justified when he told us just now that he is not prepared to make any statement upon that point until he has learned from the discussion which will shortly commence what views are entertained in all parts of the House with regard to this Bill. It seems to me, in these circumstances, that my noble friend
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0283"/>
<col>557</col>
would he well advised if he would allow us to proceed with the debate upon the Second Reading of the Bill. His Majesty's Government will then have an opportunity of considering whether they should press the Bill forward now or await a later opportunity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01685"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as expressions have been invited from different parts of the House, I venture, with great submission, to support what has fallen from the noble Marquess. Will the Government give an undertaking that if the Second. Reading is passed this afternoon no further stage will be proceeded with before the adjournment? I venture also to point out that you cannot altogether disregard the character of this measure in discussing this particular Motion. If this were a trumpery Bill that involved no particular principle at all, there would be no objection to our proceeding to pass it through all its stages at the present time; but the noble Earl in charge of the Bill has given no reasons whatever for proceeding with what I can only term the indecent haste which he proposes to utilise on the present opportunity. It is no argument to say that this Bill or a similar Bill has been read a second time in the House of Commons; for, so far as that goes, a Female Suffrage Bill was read in the House of Commons a second time the other clay. That is an entirely impracticable argument to apply to present circumstances. Perhaps one of the noble Earl's colleagues will give a reason why this Bill is introduced at the present moment and why the Government are anxious to pass it through all its stages; but I venture to suggest that no reason has been hitherto given, and I hope that the proposal made by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition will be acceded to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01686"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the observation made by my noble friend the Lord President with regard to the fact that the Bill had been more than once considered in another place has been somewhat misapprehended. Of course, it is true that in a sense that fact need have no particular weight with your Lordships. But what my noble friend desired to indicate was that the subject was no new one. It has been a matter of public discussion for the last twenty years or so, and presumably, therefore, anybody who takes any interest in it at all is familiar with
<col>558</col>
the general outlines of the Bill. I should not go further than that; but it does differ in that respect from an entirely novel proposal brought before the House for the first time.<lb/>
The noble Lord has asked whether His Majesty's Government will give an undertaking that if the discussion proceeds to-day no further steps will be taken with regard to the Bill until November. As the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition very fairly said, any decision upon that subject, so far as His Majesty's Government are able to decide it, must depend on the nature of the comments made on the Bill in the course of the discussion. For all I know, the Bill might pass through without opposition, and without knowing what the character and extent of the opposition to it is likely to be, and whether it is of a kind which could be disposed of in half an hour in Committee or would involve very prolonged discussion&#x2014;without being able to realise those points by some discussion on the Second Reading it is not possible for us to give a definite answer to that question. We should be glad if it could go through, because it is a. good Bill. But the decision whether the Bill should go through in the course of next week is, of course, one which the House must decide, after, as I say, the nature and strength of the opposition to it or the criticism which may be directed at it have been divulged by what takes place on Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01687"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps with the permission of the House I might say one word with regard to the course I propose to take on this Motion. I quite admit that it was a mistake on my part to ask the Government at that particular stage to say whether they meant to proceed with the Bill. I merely thought that I might save your Lordships' time. The noble Earl and the Leader of the House have quite properly said that they did not feel themselves at that moment able to answer the question. With regard to this Motion, what I propose to do is to accept the advice which was tendered to me by the noble Marquess and withdraw the proposal, so as to allow the House to proceed to discuss the merits of the Bill on Second Reading. But I reserve, of course, full power to myself, after your Lordships have decided what you will do regarding the Second Reading, to make
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0284"/>
<col>559</col>
any subsequent Motion at a later stage of the Bill. On that understanding I withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01688">Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01689"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My, Lords, after the little discussion which has taken place I suppose we may now proceed to discuss the merits of this particular Bill, to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading. Perhaps I might, in beginning, say that I noticed on referring to what occurred in the Standing Committee in another place that two noble Lords on the Front Opposition Bench were members of that Standing Committee&#x2014;Lord Salisbury and Lord Midleton, who both seem to have taken part in the discussions in the Standing Committee of the other House on this Bill.<lb/>
To turn to the Bill itself, your Lordships will, I think, see even from a cursory examination of it what its object is. Considerable objection, rightly or wrongly, is taken to the leasehold system up and down this country. There are a great many cases of hardship falling upon individuals, and in connection with that echoes occasionally reach your Lordships' House. We are not, however, dealing on this occasion with any case in which an individual suffers hardship, but with the circumstances which attend a religious body when they find that the lease which they have taken of a certain piece of land, and on which they have built their chapel, falls in and they are unable to secure a renewal of the lease. Under the Bill the landlord will get full value for his land. That is, we think, amply secured by the provisions which assimilate the procedure under this Bill to the procedure under the Lands Clauses Act.<lb/>
There is this, I think, to be said on behalf of those bodies who are particularly interested in this matter. They are themselves in a peculiar position, because they do not have that privilege which does exist, although I admit it is not often used, in the case of the Church of England. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners have power to acquire any freehold they require for the purpose of building a church. Naturally the Nonconformists of this country have not got that power. What we propose under this Bill is that where the landlord has shown his willingness
<col>560</col>
to lease to them a piece of land they should be able to turn that lease into a freehold so long as the piece of land and the chapel erected thereon continue to be used for the same purposes as those expressed in the trust deed. The grievance such as it is&#x2014;and it is a considerable grievance&#x2014;is felt by the Free Churches in all parts of the country. When a similar Bill was brought forward some fifteen years ago it was stated that within the previous fifty years in the metropolis over fifty Congregational chapels had ceased to exist, the land and sometimes the buildings themselves being devoted instead to trading and other purposes; and what has been experienced by one body has also been experienced by the other.<lb/>
I will give, as an instance, the position in a Welsh county. In one Welsh parish there are twenty chapels and one schoolroom, which have been built upon leasehold land at a cost of more than &#x00A3;45,000. At least eight of the chapels were erected on a thirty years lease; and in the case of a chapel which cost &#x00A3;3,000, when a further sum of &#x00A3;2,000 was spent upon it the lease was renewed for another thirty years. But although this money is spent in order to improve the chapels and to provide this accommodation, there is no security of any sort or kind that at the expiration of the lease the building or land will be available for this purpose. I ask your Lordships to turn to the Bill itself. You will see at once that there is no attempt in the Bill to secure any recognition of the enfranchisement of any land except land held on leases by trustees for the purpose of public worship; and I am sure your Lordships will recognise at once that there is a very clear and distinct difference between leases held for such a purpose as that and leases which are held for residential or trade purposes. The objects for which these leases are held command at any rate the good wishes of your Lordships' House, and can very easily be placed in a category entirely by themselves.<lb/>
In Clause 1 trustees holding under leases to which the Bill applies, and which are specified in subsection (2), are given the compulsory powers referred to, and the Bill is to apply to existing as well as to future leases. The proviso to subsection (1) contains two exceptions to the right conferred in the preceding subsection&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0285"/>
<col>561</col>
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) if the premises exceed two acres in extent the trustees shall not be entitled to exercise such right in respect of more than two acres thereof;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) this Act shall not apply where the premises are used or are proposed to be used for the purposes of a place of worship in contravention of any convenant contained in the lease.</li>
</ol>
Clause 2 provides the machinery by which the compulsory powers are to he carried out, and that is modelled upon the procedure prescribed by the Lands Clauses Act, which deals with the manner in which and the conditions under which lands can be compulsorily acquired, for purposes either of national defence, or general government, or of a local or municipal character, and, under certain circumstances&#x2014;that is to say, in the case of railways or tramways &#x2014;of a commercial character combined with public utility. So that you see a very similar power is already conferred on a number of companies, and considering the special circumstances of these religious bodies we do not think that it is asking a. very large measure of concession from your Lordships to extend it to places of worship. The sections of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, mentioned in Clause 2, are the sections dealing with the respective rights as to minerals. Clause 3 saves existing covenants. The first part of the clause is framed on Section 65 of the Conveyancing Act of 1881. The definitions in Clause 4 do not, I think, call for special attention front me on this occasion.<lb/>
I might refer to subsection (<i>d</i>) of Clause 2&#x2014;
<quote>(<i>d</i>) No allowance shall be made on account of the acquisition being compulsory.</quote>
There are several precedents for such a provision as this&#x2014;namely, in the Local Government Act, 1894; the Metropolitan Water Act, 1902; the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1907; the Housing and Town Planning Act 1909; and the Development and Road Improvements Fund Act also of last year. The modifications of the Lands Clauses Act set out in the Schedule follow the precedent of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act and the Housing and Town Planning Act. Paragraph (6) follows the precedent of the Public Offices Sites Extension Act, and a similar provision has also been inserted in numerous private Acts passed by the London County Council. One matter in connection with this Bill has been mentioned to me which seems to have
<col>562</col>
caused some fear on the part of various members of your Lordships' House. It has seemed to them possible that trustees who acquired the sites of these places of worship would be able, having once enfranchised them, to sell the land for trading or commercial purposes. That, however, is not so. If your Lordships will turn to the Schedule and look at paragraph (3), you will 'see that it is there provided that if the trustees desire to sell the premises or any part thereof, Sections 127 to 132 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, shall apply as if the premises or part thereof were superfluous lands within the meaning of those sections. That, in our opinion, entirely safeguards the landlords supposing the trustees were to try and divert the use of this land to other purposes. We also think that it would be impossible for them to let the land for other purposes, although that is a somewhat technical point with which I need not trouble your Lordships at this moment, but with which, if necessary, we could deal in Committee.<lb/>
Finally, I do not know that it is necessary for me to say more than that the object of the Bill is very plainly set forward in the Bill itself; and in view of the fact that' in all these cases the landlords must have been willing that there should be a place of worship on their land and have therefore leased land for that purpose, we do not think that in continuing that piece of land for the purpose of public worship we are inflicting any hardship on the landlords, who have already, as I have said, expressed themselves willing, and in some cases even anxious, that there should be a place of worship for their neighbours in that particular locality. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01691"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say one word on this matter. I personally had hoped that your Lordships might have been able to defer the consideration even of the Second Reading of this Bill until a later period of the session, because it is a Bill which, although not a new one, yet undoubtedly does raise several very important matters. It is, I suppose, almost too late nowadays to oppose a Bill solely on the ground that it interferes with private property or the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0286"/>
<col>563</col>
sanctity of contracts. But there was a time, not very long ago, when that would have been a good argument, and I should like your Lordships to consider for a moment the very rapid progress which Parliament is making in leaving off what no doubt are old-fashioned methods, but what at one time were regarded as methods of honesty. Land could not be taken compulsorily from any one unless for very good reasons given, except for some public purpose, and certainly for no purpose whatever unless the purchase was approved by Parliament itself.<lb/>
That was in what I may call, I suppose, the good days, before we knew the present Government or their immediate predecessors; but since their advent to power there has really been a very considerable change. It began, I think, with the Act which was mentioned by the noble Earl in moving the Second Reading of this Bill&#x2014;the Small Holdings Act. In that Act, I think for the first time, land was allowed to be taken compulsorily by an Order of a Department unconfirmed by Parliament. Now under this Bill you reach what really is, I hope, the limit of any possible villainy in this respect. You provide that an individual, of his own volition, may purchase compulsorily land which belongs to his ground landlord, without the approval of any Department or without the approval of Parliament. I venture to say that is a very large advance upon what we have always recognised as the methods of compulsory purchase of land in this country.<lb/>
There are a large number of details in this Bill, even if we accept the principle, which require careful consideration. In many respects it is a very technical measure. I should like to refer to one instance, and perhaps it is only a minor matter. It may be quite right that a reversion of buildings used as places of public worship should be vested in the leasehold. It may be no real hardship to take away that particular reversion from the ground landlord, because I imagine that in the great majority of cases leases for that class of building are in any case continued. At all events in my experience I have never heard of a case where the landlord has exercised his right. But in the term "place of worship" is included the minister's house "attached to or used in connection with any place of
<col>564</col>
worship." I suggest to the noble Earl that there may be instances where the minister's house, although it is used in connection with a place of worship, does not necessarily adjoin a place of worship. A minister may be occupying a dwelling house which was not intended for a minister's house at all. There are many cases I know of where a house is provided for the purposes of a minister, but the clergyman has let it and taken a smaller house elsewhere. It appears that under this Bill he could claim that the purchase of the freehold should be allotted to him personally. That seems to me a considerable hardship upon the ground landlord. I do not wish to go into the details of the Bill now, but I hope, even if your Lordships do grant a Second Reading to the Bill to-day, you will be prepared to put off the Committee stage until after the autumn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01692"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot agree with any noble Lord who says that we are not competent to discuss this Bill now. This Bill in many ways has been urgently needed for years, and in some respects I do not think the Bill goes anything like far enough. The noble Lord who has just spoken complained of the tendency to extend the power of compulsory acquisition of land outside the scope of Parliamentary control. If your Lordships want to preserve your rights of property in land, it is essential that you should recognise the right of the community to come in and acquire land where it is necessary for the convenience and welfare of any substantial body of the population, provided fair and proper compensation is paid. The noble Earl the Lord President of the Council mentioned that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have power to acquire compulsorily land as sites for churches, and I think it is desirable that other bodies wishing for sites for places of worship should have similar power, subject to a right of appeal to some proper authority being granted to the owners of the land.<lb/>
I do not see why, when there is a substantial body of the community wanting land which is essential as a site on which to erect a building for the common exercise of their religion, they should not have reasonable opportunities of acquiring it; and I believe there is not one in a hundred among members of your Lordships' House
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0287"/>
<col>565</col>
who would refuse a site in these circumstances, however distasteful to him the doctrines of the particular body might be. I think the noble Earl the Lord President made a mistake when he said that you might infer, from the fact that existing landowners or their predecessors had granted the leasehold of sites for religious worship, that they were in sympathy with that object. I believe that many landowners have, from a sense of fair-play, readily granted sites for places of worship which were positively distasteful to them.<lb/>
The noble Earl mentioned Wales. No doubt if you rake up the past history of Wales there have been many cases of very great grievance. I do not say that you could not rake up some cases of grievance now; but I believe that the number of landowners who would venture to withstand the criticism of public opinion and refuse a site is very small. I should be glad if this Bill went further, and enabled, under suitable protection of the reasonable rights of property, the acquisition of sites for the development of other purposes. Not more than an hour ago I was criticising an attempt to invade the rights of private property beyond what was necessary for the particular purpose to be accomplished, but your Lordships were quite ready cheerfully to interfere with the private rights of patrons, although previous legislation showed that that interference had not been found necessary for the purpose of providing new Bishoprics. I think this Bill is subject to criticism from the same point of view. I entirely agree with simple and cheap machinery for settling the compensation to be awarded. I would negative expressly the customary ten per cent. I think if people wish to enfranchise buildings of this sort, they should be allowed to do so at the real value. I do not see, however, that because the purpose for which any particular property is required is desirable the owner should be compelled to give up the reversion for less than its real value. By enacting, as is proposed in this Bill, that in determining the amount of any compensation the value of any buildings erected by the trustees or improvements made by them shall be excluded, the landlords affected would be made compulsory subscribers to chapel funds, and Parliament would thus be practising a vicarious generosity. If a man takes land on lease-
<col>566</col>
hold, especially on a short lease, it is quite obvious that he pays a much smaller-ground rent than if he took a feu or a, 999 years lease.<lb/>
Lord Clinton called attention to the power to take the house occupied by the minister as well as the chapel. I assume the Bill means held under the same trust and the same lease. If in a town like Southport the minister of a chapel takes, a house convenient for his chapel from the ground landlord the Bill would not give him a right to enfranchise that house. I think the Bill means where you take one conveyance for the chapel and for a minister's house with it. If that is right if that is a sound principle to adopt, you ought certainly, especially in Wales, to go further, for practically every one of the chapels in the part of Wales that I know has also a chapel-keeper's house attached to it, and it is much more essential to the chapel that you should enfranchise the chapel-keeper's house, which is substantially a necessary part of the building, than the minister's house. If you are to affirm the principle that lessees should have the right to enfranchise the site of' their chapel without the landlord taking into consideration the value of the building, including the minister's house, then I say distinctly that in Committee you ought to extend it so as to include the chapel-keeper's house. If you grant the principle you ought fairly to go furthers. For my part I heartily agree with the principle. I am quite sure many of your Lordships who have property where there are a large number of these chapels have been only too glad to grant the fee simple where you could. This is a thing which all of us are doing as far as we can of our own accord. But it is one thing to do a thing of your own accord and another-for the law to step in and say this shall he done and your legal rights altered whether you like it or not.<lb/>
There is another provision in the Bill, that the intermediate landowner, as I may call him, may take an annuity of the rent-charge instead of a capital sum, but the ultimate landlord, I think, is bound to be paid off in capital. I may mention that in Lancashire we have chief rent for perpetuity, or in those towns of Lancashire where we do not have chief rent we have a 999 years lease, which is equivalent to a perpetuity. I am
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0288"/>
<col>567</col>
quite sure that many landowners would much prefer to get their rent in perpetuity than be paid off and have to reinvest their money. But, my Lords, this Bill in principle ought to be passed. It is very much needed. It is fair and proper, and I hope your Lordships will go a great deal further in recognising that the land on which the people live must somehow or other by law be made much more accessible for any purpose which is reasonably desired by a substantial number. I do not say that A.B. is to be able to go to a farmer and say, "I want this field," and get it. You have gone some way towards that by the Small Holdings Act. But where any reasonable section of the community demand land I think they ought to be able to get it. If, however, it is to be recognised that the lessees of chapel property are to get the property for less than the legal value, why should not a municipality be entitled, if they are fortunate enough to get a reasonably short lease from a landowner&#x2014;say twenty-seven years&#x2014;to turn round when the land has developed and acquire it under the law at a price below its value? As your Lordships have shown a disregard of this point in the case of ecclesiastical matters, it may be said that you will show the same disregard as to secular. Whether that will be the result or not, we have set a precedent which I notice your Lordships shuddered at when the question came up with regard to Ireland and Scotland. And if you set these precedents on behalf of the established Church and the Nonconformists, I hope we shall be equally self-sacrificing in the interests of the community at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01693"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down and my noble friend Lord Clinton have found in this Bill at least the germs, if not something more, of some very wide principle with regard to dealing in land. I do not look at it in that way, and I do not think the Bill deserves the denunciation of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton; nor do I find in the Bill any warrant for the proposals the noble Lord who has just sat down has made for a wide extension of the principle of the Bill itself to all kinds of property held for all kinds of purposes by all kinds of bodies. It may be right and proper that some consideration should be given to the necessity, which no doubt exists in some cases, for
<col>568</col>
regular religious bodies to obtain sites for places of worship. That is not a matter dealt with by this Bill, and it does not seem to me, therefore, to be a thing that can be profitably discussed on the present occasion. What this Bill proposes is simply this, as I understand it: that where the landlord or his predecessor has voluntarily given a site on a building lease for a chapel, when that lease comes to an end the persons representing the religious body which owns the chapel shall be entitled to claim the enfranchisement of that site on such terms as are proposed under the Bill. I believe there is a real grievance in this matter that requires to be remedied. I cannot quote a particular instance, but I have certainly heard of cases in which, where such leases have been granted, landlords have declined on any terms to renew them, with the result that the congregations had to discontinue their services in chapels where they and their forefathers had been worshipping, perhaps, for seventy or eighty years. I do not believe for a moment that your Lordships will defend such an exercise of his right on the part of any landlord, and I think the noble Lord is correct in saying that landlords as a rule have shown themselves most generous in these matters, and have readily given sites to religious bodies with whose principles and tenets they themselves entirely disagree. But as these cases to which I have alluded have undoubtedly happened, there is a grievance which Parliament assuredly ought to endeavour to remedy. That is all we are considering, as I understand it, in discussing the Second Reading of this Bill. But what has been said will be enough to point out to His Majesty's Government that there are points in this Bill which do require careful discussion and consideration, and in these circumstances I hope its further stages will be adjourned to the autumn sitting. We shall then have plenty of time to consider such points as have been raised with regard to compensation in respect of particular buildings which may be considered necessary for the purposes of worship in the chapel, whether it be the minister's house or the caretaker's house or anything else which is included in the agreement under which the chapel is held, and the mode in which the compensation should be given, whether by an annual rent-charge to the landlord or a lump sum. Those matters can be considered in detail when the time
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0289"/>
<col>569</col>
comes. All we are asked to do to-day is to admit the grievance and give a Second Reading to a Bill which proposes to remedy it. I hope that your Lordships may be disposed to take that course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01694"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will only trouble your Lordships with a few words in support of this Bill on Second Reading. I think this question may be approached from two points of view&#x2014;in the interests of religious communities and in the interests of property. Naturally it is chiefly as the Bill affects the interests of religious communities that I venture to say a few words. This is not a matter which directly concerns the Church of England. I should like to remove a misapprehension which might be created by what has been said, I think on both sides of the House, that the Church of England is in the habit of exercising compulsory powers for the acquisition of freeholds for its places of worship. That is not so. It is true that, by virtue of two Acts of Parliament passed in the reign of George III, the Church Building Commissioners, now the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, have such compulsory powers, but those powers are coupled with so many antiquated provisions that I am informed they are never used. I do not know of any instance within recent memory in which the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have compulsorily acquired freehold property for sites. Therefore I should like to make it plain that it is not proposed to bestow upon other religious bodies a privilege which is in the enjoyment of the Church of England and which the Church of England continually exercises. What is true is that in the case of the Church of England no parish church can be consecrated until the freehold has been acquired. Therefore so far as our parish churches are concerned the difficulties contemplated in this Bill cannot arise. They can only arise in the case of unconsecrated buildings.<lb/>
But I am informed that in many parts of the country there is, as has been pointed out to your Lordships, a very great grievance on the part of many members of other religious communities. They have spent large sums of money upon the building of their chapels. They have become attached to the place in which these chapels are situated, and it is a real
<col>570</col>
grievance if they should be subjected to the risk at the end of the time of being turned out of premises towards the erection of which so much money has been given and to which so much association is attached. It is because I feel that there is this grievance on the part of many Nonconformists that I trust your Lordships may so far as possible be able to remedy it. With regard to the matter as it affects the interests of property, it is obviously not within my competence to deal with that side of the question. I think it has been abundantly made plain that there are points in this Bill that require greater clearness of expression and of definition. With those I do not deal. They have been dealt with sufficiently by noble Lords upon both sides. As a matter of fact, I believe that the grievance alleged only occurs in a few cases, because am satisfied that the great majority of your Lordships would be willing to extend a leasehold in cases where money has been expended on the buildings. But there is, of course, always the possibility of an exception to that general rule, and it is to guard against the grievance that arises if powers are exercised by landlords against the interests of these religious communities that this Bill is directed. I can only say, on behalf of those who sit on these Benches, that we give our cordial support to the general principle of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01695"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help saying one or two words upon the debate we have just heard. We have been told by the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite that a. great ninny people would very much like to have the fee simple of the site of the buildings which they have erected on lease, and he thinks it a great argument in favour of his Bill that landlords have given their land for this purpose, and therefore in his opinion there is no injustice in annexing the freehold. I know that the ethics of private life and political life are totally different, It would not be possible for noble Lords opposite to treat such matters as these in private life as they treat them in political life. Supposing I lend the noble Earl a horse. I may possibly ask a little money for it by way of hire. The noble Earl's argument comes to this, "I have taken a fancy to this horse and now I intend to buy it"; and he uses my kindness in allowing him to.
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0290"/>
<col>571</col>
use the horse for a certain number of months as an argument in favour of my taking no objection to his depriving me of my horse altogether. Those are the ethics of the present proposal.<lb/>
This proposal is excused upon two grounds. One is that land, as is sometimes said, is a monopoly. It has again and again been stated in this debate that landlords have been liberal in giving their land to various religious denominations, whether they are in favour of the tenets of those denominations or not. Lord Sheffield, who, I think, is partial in such matters, made some reservation in regard to Wales. Of Wales I know nothing. I must confess that I was sorry my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn should have made the statement that he had heard of several very hard cases. Lord Clinton said he was totally unaware of any instance in which either buildings had been unfairly resumed, or the use of land for the purpose bad been refused. I do think that if assertions such as the noble Viscount made are to be brought forward they should be substantiated.<lb/>
It has been implied that the monopoly to which I have referred is so great that these denominations cannot get land for their purposes, and I think the noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, said it was a great consideration how many people wanted it. That is an excellent argument for taking land compulsorily for religious purposes, but it is no argument whatever for taking advantage of a landlord's kindness in letting a site for a particular building and saying that that particular site should be taken compulsorily. I must say I was somewhat surprised, if he will forgive my saying so, at what the most. rev. Primate said. He most fairly admitted that the question as it concerned the landlord did not concern him. All he felt was that it was very convenient for religious bodies to get property. That I quite admit. But he went further, and said that it was a great grievance that buildings should be erected on leasehold unless the land could be acquired when wanted in fee simple. That is practically the argument he used. My Lords, how far does that go? It is not a religious argument. These people have erected the buildings on the understanding that it was a leasehold, with the full knowledge that at the termination of the lease they would be liable to be dis-
<col>572</col>
possessed. If that is the canon to be laid down by ecclesiastical authorities as to the way we should treat land, I can only say that it is rather a far-reaching doctrine.<lb/>
I do not want to detain your Lordships by dealing with the details of this Bill. It is a very ill-drawn Bill and will require a great deal of discussion. It does not refer only to religious buildings. It is called the Places of Worship (Enfranchisement) Bill. I shall have to ask what is a place of worship. When I look at the definition I find that a place of worship means a church, a chapel, or a meetinghouse used for religious worship, and it includes a burial ground, a Sunday-school, and a minister's house. I think that is rather a large series of items to include under the title of this Bill. It does to some extent affect the Church of England, because a great many mission halls are given to the Church of England while the operations of the Church are extending with a view to the building of regular churches afterwards. That is a very good instance. I heard it stated just now in debate that the instances where a landlord would wish to resume the use of a building which had been used for religious worship were very few. But in the case of these mission halls, not a few of them are let on the understanding that when the parish is developed and when the church is built those mission halls shall be resumed for secular purposes. You are, therefore, by this Bill giving a power to religious bodies which they have not only never had before but which they have never dreamt of acquiring. I do not wish to detain the House further on this occasion, but I trust that plenty of time will be given for the consideration of this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01696"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BRISTOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I add a few words in favour of the Second Reading of this Bill? First of all, I have very true sympathy for those who suffer the tremendous hardship of having a building taken away that they have used for public worship for fifty, sixty or seventy years. That is one reason that induces me to vote in favour of the Second Reading. Another reason is that I am most grateful to His Majesty's Government for their attitude in this matter. They have brought before the public, in the most definite and positive way, their sense of the extreme hardship
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0291"/>
<col>573</col>
which is inflicted on religious communities in being turned oat of buildings which have been hallowed as a place of worship for a number of years, and the hardship is enormously enhanced in the case of those whom it is proposed to dislodge from buildings the associations with which date back centuries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01697"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly do not rise to oppose this Bill on the ground that it necessitates interference with contract. I do not know whether I ought to make an exception in the case of the noble Duke behind me, but I doubt whether any of us on this side of the House would be prepared to vote against, the Bill on the ground merely that it allowed an invasion of contract. My noble friend Lord Clinton spoke rather wistfully of what he called old-fashioned ideas and old-fashioned procedure with regard to these matters. I would be inclined to say that, while the old-fashioned procedure for the acquisition of land for public purposes was very much too slow, too cumbrous, and, above all, too expensive, modern procedure is perhaps tending to become a little too rapid and reckless. I would certainly never resist a well-considered proposal for compulsorily acquiring property in the public interest, making always these reservations&#x2014;that those who desire to make out their case must first show that there is a real necessity for such acquisition; next, that there should be proper machinery for compensating those from whom the property is taken; and thirdly&#x2014;and perhaps this is the most important of all&#x2014;that there should be a trustworthy tribunal for the purpose of determining what that compensation should be. It is upon that last rock, I think, which some of our modern proposals are apt to split.<lb/>
The particular proposal before us does seem, I must say, at first sight to be a somewhat violent interference with existing contracts, because these are contracts which have been entered into without any duress being applied and between people who are perfectly competent to make contracts and presumably to protect their own interests. And not only will an opportunity be given for disturbing contracts, but they are to be automatically disturbed whether any grievance is alleged or not. On the other hand I freely admit that it seems to me desirable in the
<col>574</col>
public interest that the occupants of these places of worship should be given an amply secure tenure. I do not think it is even necessary that the advocates of these proposals should be able to produce a series of hard cases in order to support them. I would put it simply upon the broad ground that it was not a good thing that those who occupied. public places of worship should feel that they were liable, from one cause or another, to have their tenure rudely interrupted and to be expelled from the place in they and their predecessors may have worshipped for a great number of years. Therefore I think this proposal can be defended on its merits and without those somewhat dangerous excursions made by the noble Lord on the Back Bench opposite (Lord Sheffield), and, I think, also to some extent by the noble Earl who moved the Bill. The noble Earl began by making a very pointed reference to the prevailing dissatisfaction with what he called the leasehold system. That is a very large question, but for the present I do not think that the House need concern itself with more than the very concrete and limited proposal which is before it.<lb/>
What has happened, I take it, all over the country is that many owners of land &#x2014;I think I should be inclined to say most owners of land&#x2014;have been ready to give to the different religious denominations opportunities of building places of worship upon their estates. That having been done, I doubt extremely whether there is any reason for giving them opportunities of resuming these places, because it is part of the scheme of this Bill that the trusts upon which the premises are originally conveyed are to survive. Therefore, all that will happen under the Bill will be that the chapel carried on as a Methodist chapel will continue to be carried on as a Methodist chapel. It seems to me not irrelevant to observe&#x2014;and I believe I am correct in making the observation&#x2014;that in the case of the Church of England it hardly ever happens that a new church is built except upon a freehold site.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01699"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My case is even stronger than I thought. That being the practice in regard to the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0292"/>
<col>575</col>
Church, I can understand the corresponding desire on the part of other denominations for permanency of tenure. I shall, therefore, give my vote for the Second Reading. But I think, after the discussion that has taken place, it must be abundantly clear to His Majesty's Government that there are a number of points in the Bill which require careful examination in detail, and it would be altogether unfair to the House to ask us to take the remaining stages of the Bill during the few days that separate us from the adjournment. The definition of "places of worship" is an extraordinarily loosely-drawn one, and certainly requires to be considered. There is again a. provision which affects not only leases but under-leases which requires to be examined, and I think there probably is a good deal to be said with regard to the whole of the proposals in the Bill relating to procedure. The Schedule is a very difficult document to study. It contains some extraordinary passages. May I read the first two lines of the Schedule? They run thus&#x2014;
<quote>"The use of the premises as a place of worship and for purposes connected therewith shall be deemed to be the undertaking or the railway."</quote>
That may be excellent drafting, but at first sight it reads rather curiously. Therefore I do make a very strong appeal to the noble Earl who will follow me to tell us that he will rest content for the present with the Second Reading of the Bill and that the remaining stages will be taken when we reassemble in the autumn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01700"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this debate has wandered somewhat beyond the narrow limits of the Bill itself, and in one or two cases has been diverted into a general disquisition upon the rights of property in land. I do not propose to follow those who have made these excursions, because I think this Bill must be taken on its merits and in respect to the particular matters to which it applies. The argument for the Bill is that it applies to places of worship, and certainly I am prepared to maintain, and I should have thought that most, noble Lords in the House would have been prepared to maintain, that a. place of worship is intrinsically different from other buildings of the ordinary kind erected under similar circumstances. I entirely agree with the substance of what has been said by the noble Marquess who has just sat down, and it appears to me to be the main reason for
<col>576</col>
the Bill that the system of short leases is one which in itself is thoroughly inapplicable to an ecclesiastical building. If it had been applied to the churches of the Church of England we should have lost a great deal of that historic sentiment in relation to those buildings which those of us who belong to the Church of England so deeply value.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate who spoke, as I was glad to observe, so strongly in support of the Bill, alluded to an observation of my noble friend's as to the compulsory powers possessed by the Church of England, and he very truly pointed out that those powers are not easy to exercise, and, as a matter of fact, they are not so far as I know, ever exercised. But, of course, it has to he borne in mind that there is not much reason to exercise them, because freehold land for churches can as a matter of fact always be obtained. I do not know what proportion of the land of England is in possession of members of the Church of England but it must be very large, and I feel almost sorry at this moment that we did not accept the proposition of the noble Lord opposite for a religious census, because it might have enabled us to insert a further table by which we could have come to know how much land belongs to members of the Church of England. It must be undoubtedly a very large proportion of the whole. Therefore the particular difficulties in respect of which this Bill is introduced do not arise in relation to the Church of England.<lb/>
The noble Duke opposite took a very high line on this subject. He accused us of having an entirely different standard of ethics in public and private life, and asked how we should like to see in private life the principle of this Bill applied. I think the noble Duke has two very distinct standards of ethics&#x2014;one for the House of Lords and the other as to his own estate management. Here we are familiar with speeches by the noble Duke pressing the rights of property to an extent which, I think, would almost have horrified a French marquis in the reign of Louis XV, whereas I am certain that in the management of his wide estates he does not press those rights, but acts as most, members of your Lordships' House do in giving a reasonable interpretation to the claims which he may possess by law.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01702"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke apparently considered that it was an arbitrary invasion of those rights not to permit a landlord at the expiry of a lease of a place of worship to take it over and to put it to any use that he chose. That I consider to be an assertion of the rights of property which at this time it is impossible to maintain, and I am prefectly certain that the noble Duke on his own estates would not desire to do anything of the kind. I am convinced that if a case came before him he would desire to meet those who worship in a building of that kind, and whose fathers had worshipped there before, in the spirit that such a. case would be met, as I believe, by every member of your Lordships' House. I have no desire to enter into any of the various points of detail Which have been raised in the course of this discussion. The noble Marquess and the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, both appealed to us on this side not to ask the House to proceed with the later stages of this Bill before the adjournment. We should have been glad to proceed with them, but I can assure noble Lords opposite that in our desire to do so we had no malignant object in view. The reason why we should have liked to proceed with this measure and to get it through before the adjournment is that the autumn session will, I hope, not be a very long one, but so far as business in another place is concerned it may conceivably be a tolerably crowded session, and it would, in our opinion, have greatly facilitated the passage of the Bill if it could have been got through this House now and taken in another place in one of those intervals of business which, as one knows, always occur even in the most crowded sessions. Therefore, if we respond to the appeal of the noble Marquess and do not proceed with the Bill now, I hope that it may be possible to take the Committee stage at the very beginning of the autumn session. That will certainly give noble Lords interval enough to prepare their Amendments. All I hope is that when we reassemble noble Lords opposite will not ask for more time; otherwise the prospects of the Bill in another place would be in peril, and that, I think, almost all your
<col>578</col>
Lordships would regret, because I think from the debate the general principle of this measure receives the assent of the vast majority of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH LAND LEGISLATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01706"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> rose to call attention to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Dublin on Tuesday, 19th July, in the case of the estate of Sir C. M. Dom-vile, and to ask His Majesty's Government whether this decision carries out the intentions they held when the Bill of. 1909 was introduced, and if not, whether they intend to propose legislation to Parliament mitigating the hardships caused by this decision in this and similar cases; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01707">The noble Earl said: My Lords, before I say a few words on the subject of the Notice that I have put on the Paper, I desire to express my regret on two heads to the noble Lord opposite who represents the Irish Office. First, of all, doubtless I owing to the fact that I write a shocking hand, I have been totally unable to induce the printers to spell the name of Sir Compton Dom-vile correctly. I made two attempts, and I do not know which attempt was the worse. Also, owing to a lapse of memory which the noble Lord put right yesterday, I referred to the particular words of the clause in which I am to-day interested and asked the noble Lord whether they expressed the intentions of the Government when the Bill of last year was introduced. The noble Lord reminded me that they were introduced into the Bill on the motion of my noble friend Lord Dunboyne. I have looked up the records and remember the circumstances very well, and I hope this fault of mine in forgetting that fact has in no way inconvenienced the noble Lord in preparing for this afternoon's discussion.
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0294"/>
<col>579</col>
If it has, I am anxious to offer him all the apologies I can. The fact, however, that these words were actually introduced as an Amendment from this side of the House I think strengthens my position in making the contention I desire to make this afternoon, for our impression of the significance of these words was very different from what the Courts in Ireland have construed them to mean. The particular words of the clause are&#x2014;
<quote>"in consequence of any direction of the Land Commission a fresh agreement is entered into."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01708">It sometimes happens, not in a case of the sale of tenanted lands but of untenanted lands, that the Land Commission direct an alteration in the price. It may be an alteration in the amount or in the method of payment of the price, and it has been held by the Courts that this direction does not constitute a direction to alter an agreement. It has been held by the Courts that it entails an actual tearing up of the old agreement and the making of a new one. That, we feel is a very substantial grievance, and certainly contrary to what we hoped would be the construction of the Act when it was passed last year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01709">I am quite aware that the three cases in question are large cases, but this can arise in very small cases and very great injustice will be done if the state of affairs is to he allowed to remain as we fear it may remain as the result of the decision of last week. I may say I know of small cases in which hardship will be caused unless the Government, either by legislation or by administrative action are ready to help us out of the difficulty. Imagine the case of an agreement for the sale of untenanted land, the price being &#x00A3;1,000. The agreement, if it is before the Estates Commissioners now, was probably signed four or five years ago. The Estates Commissioners, when the turn of that estate comes to be considered, may say, "No, we will not advance &#x00A3;1,000 in this case." They need give no reason for saying that. They simply say, "We are only prepared to advance &#x00A3;900." The usual thing then is for the vendor, who may he the landlord or a trustee, to go to the purchaser and say, "The Commissioners will only advance &#x00A3;900; what are you going to do about the balance?" and probably if the man is a substantial man lie gives cash for the &#x00A3;100, or part of it, leaving the remainder on second mortgage. The purchase money would remain exactly the same; the only
<col>580</col>
change would be that the vendor would lose the bonus on the &#x00A3;100 that he takes in cash from the purchaser. All that has happened is that the Estates Commissioners have directed a variation in the method of obtaining the purchase money. But if the Court of Appeal holds in these particular cases&#x2014;and there is no reason why the same procedure should not be applied to every case of sale of untenanted land in future&#x2014;that the agreement once varied by the Estates Commissioners is at an end and that a new agreement must be made, it means that the vendor will have to take Stock instead of cash, that the bonus will be reduced in accordance with the new scale, and that the purchaser will have to pay the higher rate of annuity. It does seem unreasonable that merely by this very small variation, in almost every case merely of the method by which the vendor receives his purchase money and not necessarily of the amount at all, all the advantages which were expected at the time the bargain was made should be lost to both vendor and purchaser owing to this, as I think, unexpected decision of the Courts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01710">These bargains were made years ago, but they have not been carried through owing to the fact, for which no one is to blame, that the administration of the Act of 1903 has not proceeded so fast as the actual signing of agreements under it. I cannot help thinking that by this decision of the Court of Appeal, which I understand is a finaldecision, the Government are every bit as disagreeably surprised as we are, and I hope they will be able to tell us that either by legislation or some alteration in procedure this difficulty will be got over. I am advised that if they gave a direction for the agreement to be altered in a way that might, as the result of negotiation, be suggested by vendor and tenant, the difficulty might be got over, and in that way vendors and purchasers, who certainly in equity are entitled to the benefits of the Act of 1903 in place of the disadvantages of the Act of 1909, would have those benefits secured to them. I hope that the noble Lord who represents the Irish Office will be able to tell us that His Majesty's Government are charitably disposed in this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01711">Moved, That there be laid before the House Papers relating to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Dublin on Tuesday, 19th July, in the case of the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0295"/>
<col>581</col>
estate of Sir C. M. Domvile.&#x2014;:(<i>The Earl of Donoughmore.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01712"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who moved this Motion has lost no time in bringing this matter to your Lordships' attention. I may say that there is no official report of what took place at the trial by the Court of Appeal in the case of Sir C.M. Domvile's estate, and we have to rely solely on a newspaper report. We have telegraphed to the Estates Commissioners, and they have given us to understand that in substance the report that has reached us is correct, but it must not be supposed as far as the facts are concerned that I am answering on any higher authority than the newspaper report. The noble Earl seems to me, in the speech he has made, to have altered the ground upon which he brings this case before your Lordships. If you refer to his Notice you will see that he at first asked whether this decision carries out the intentions of the Government in the Act of 1909. I understand lie now accepts the fact that the particular words with which he is concerned were not in the original Bill, but were inserted at the instance of Lord Dunboyne. He further, I understand, no longer claims that this particular case, at any rate, is one of hardship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01713"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I say it is one of great hardship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01714"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I understood the noble Earl to state a hypothetical case only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01715"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: Only because the hypothetical case was a small case, and these are big cases, I wanted to show that this is not only a matter of big sales and holdings, but a case which will frequently happen, and very often in small cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01716"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: At any rate the noble Earl does not now seem to think that there is any cause for legislation, and that very largely modifies the position he has taken up. I do not know that it is necessary to go very deeply into this case. It is a rather difficult and complicated one. The whole case turns upon the interpretation of words inserted at the instance of Lord Dunboyne, to the effect that the Estates Commissioners may make a direction in cases
<col>582</col>
in which some variation of the terms of purchase are contemplated, and that the effect of such direction on their part is to bring the new purchase under the terms of the old scale. It really turns upon that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01717"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGIIMORE</member><membercontribution>: To remain under the terms of the old scale.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01718"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Yes, as the noble Earl says, to remain under the terms of the old scale. In this particular case there were three farms belonging to Sir C. M. Domvile, and in the year 1905 Sir C. M. Domvile came to an understanding with his tenants for the sale of those three farms at sums all exceeding &#x00A3;5,000. That was lodged with the Commissioners in 1905. The case was not reached until 1909. Then the Commissioners informed the trustees of Sir C. M. Domvile's estate that they could not advance more than &#x00A3;5,000 in any case. It seems then that the vendor came to an understanding with the tenants by which they were to pay the balance over and above the &#x00A3;5,000, and he applied to the Commissioners to see whether he could still obtain the twelve per cent. bonus and the cash under the old scale. He proposed to effect this in one of two ways, either by endorsing the consent on the existing agreements or by entering into fresh agreements by regarding the action of the Estates Commissioners as amounting to a direction. Upon that the Estates Commissioners applied to Mr. Justice Wylie, the Judicial Commissioner, and asked for a decision as to whether, if they gave a direction, the agreement would come under the old scale; secondly, if they gave no direction, whether it would come under the old scale; and, further, whether their minute saying they could not advance more than &#x00A3;5,000 constituted a direction. The Judge gave no opinion on the first point. He ruled on the other point in the negative&#x2014;that is to say, that their Memorandum did not constitute a direction, and that, in the failure to give such a direction, the agreement would have to be regarded as a future purchase agreement; and that was confirmed on appeal, as the noble Earl says. But I would point out that there is nothing in this judgment to preclude the trustees front applying to the Commissioners for such a direction. I do not believe they have ever done it. Does the noble Earl know?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0296"/>
<col>583</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01719"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know about this case. I know a case in which an application either has been made or is going to be made in a very few days.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01720"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: At any rate there is nothing in this judgment to preclude their making such an application; nor is there anything in the judgment to prevent the Commissioners, so far as I know, from making such a direction. Therefore, if I may say so very respectfully, I think that in bringing this forward at this stage the noble Earl is somewhat premature. For all we know the grievance which he thinks exists may have disappeared in the natural course of administrative action. With regard to the question as to whether this is a hard case or not, I am perfectly prepared to admit that if the decision as to this particular purchase had been reached before November, 1908, the vendor and the tenants would have been entitled to the much better terms which then existed. But I should also like to point out that when the parties entered into the agreement for so large a purchase as this, they were aware that, under Section 1, subsection (4), of the Act of 1903, agreements for purchase of over &#x00A3;5,000 could only be sanctioned if the Commissioners regarded such sanction as expedient, and also that a refusal to sanction voided the agreement. They must have known in the year 1905 that they were running great risks of not getting the agreement they had made sanctioned. I may further say, in that relation, that had it not been for the Act of 1909 the hardship, of which they regard this particular case as an example, might have been very much greater, because after September, 1908, the original terms of the Act of 1903 automatically ceased.<lb/>
It is very difficult to say how far this case is representative. This is the first case of the kind which has been reached. The Commissioners are quite unable to forecast how many similar cases there may be in front of them; but I would point out that it can only apply to a limited number of cases. For instance, all the cases which you may define as zone cases must go through automatically, and the Commissioners would not have any power to vary the terms of the purchases as they have in this case. I may say that it is not at all the intention of the Estates Com-
<col>584</col>
missioners that this should be regarded as a precedent of what is likely to happen in the future, and I think it is really too early to judge as to what the effect of the interpretation of this particular phrase in the clause may be. Meanwhile I cannot see what there is to prevent the trustees from making an application in the ordinary way to the Estates Commissioners, and after they have made that application it will be time for us, I think, to consider what action, if any, it is necessary to take in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01721"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it seems to me that the whole crux of this matter lies in the question asked by the Estates Commissioners of the Judicial Commissioner. I can understand him giving no answer. This has happened before. It happened in my case when I sold my property. I arranged with the tenant when the sum was over &#x00A3;5,000 that he was either to find the rest of it or it was to remain on second mortgage. But what I complain of is that His Majesty's. Government have expressed no wish to settle this matter. This is really a test case, and the noble Earl asked what they were going to do in the matter. The Government have referred the matter back, so to speak, to the Estates Commissioners. They say, "If the trustees choose, they can go to the Estates Commissioners." But I must point out that the Estates Commissioners asked a question of the Judicial Commissioner which is the crux of the whole thing, and that question is not answered. I do not see that the Estates Commissioners, if it is going to be referred back to them, can say anything more about the matter. The bargain was made under the 1903 Act; then came the Act of 1909, and when it is a question of the twelve per cent. bonus it is very easy to say, although we do not think it is quite right, "We do not look upon this as the original bargain; there has been a variation by the Commissioners." I can quite understand that upon that variation the Commissioners, or people in authority, may say, "Oh, no, this bonus cannot be paid on the full sum; a new direction has been granted by us." That is the whole reason why Sir Compton Domvile's trustees had to take the matter before the Courts. The answer the Government have given us now is to refer us back to the Estates Commissioners, which I consider most unsatisfactory.</membercontribution></p>

<col>585</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01722"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The ease has never been raised in a substantive form. The Judge refused to give a decision on a merely hypothetical case. If the trustees apply to the Estates Commissioners then the case would come forward in a substantive form before the Judicial Commissioner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01723"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Then he can really answer the question that they put to him. Now we have got to the crux of the matter, because that is the thing on which the whole question turns. I hope that the trustees of Sir Compton Domvile will refer it back to the Estates Commissioners, and then I hope the Judicial Commissioner will see his way to give a direct answer. We shall then know where we are. I am much obliged to the noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, for explaining that point, and I have nothing more to say about the matter at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01724"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I have to thank the noble Lord for the hint he has given us, as regards this first question, that we should approach the Estates Commissioners, and I hope from the way he has addressed us this afternoon that we may look for as favourable a decision from them as we should get from the noble Lord if we were applying to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01725">Motion, by leave, <i>withdrawn.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01726"><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government for the following information as to the working of the Irish Land Act, 1909, during the period ended June 30, 1910&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. How many vendors have lodged originating applications for direct sales from landlord to tenant and other sales;</li>
<li>2. What is the total of the advances applied for under such applications;</li>
<li>3. How many purchase agreements at three and a-half per cent. annuities have been lodged;</li>
<li>4. What is the total of the advances applied for under such agreements;</li>
<li>5. How many originating requests have been lodged fur sales of estates direct to the Land Commission;</li>
<li>6. How many holdings are comprised in those requests.</li>
</ol></p>
<col>586</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01727">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to put the Questions that stand in my name on the Paper with the object of obtaining information on these various points. At first sight Question 2 and Question 4 might appear to be identical, but they are not so, because Question 2 refers to originating applications which contain besides tenanted land parcels of untenanted land, whereas Question 4 refers only to the advances and the purchase agreements confined solely to tenanted land. I hope the noble Lord will be able to give me the information asked for.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01728"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the information the noble Lord asks for is as follows. The Estates Commissioners report that from December 3, 1909, to June 30, 1910, thirty-five originating applications were lodged by vendors for the sale of the estates therein comprised direct to the tenants. In answer to Question 2, 352 purchase agreements for the sale of holdings on these estates have been lodged, and the purchase money applied for therein is &#x00A3;106,979. In four of these estates no purchase agreements have yet been lodged. In reply to Questions 3 and 4, 2,379 agreements at three and a-half per cent. annuities have been lodged, and the advances therein applied for amount to &#x00A3;611,226. These figures include those given in answer to the second Question, and the difference represents purchase agreements lodged for sale of holdings on estates in which the originating applications were lodged prior to the passing of the Act of 1909. The reply to Questions 5 and 6 is that fourteen originating requests have been lodged by the vendors for the sale of the estates therein comprised direct to the Land Commission. The estimated number of holdings comprised in these requests is. 480.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01729"><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask His Majesty's Government whether they can state how soon the Annual Reports of the Irish Land Commissioners and of the Estates Commissioners respectively for the year ended March 31, 1910, may be expected to be in the hands of the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01730"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The Report of the Irish Land Commission for the year ended March 31, 1910, has been submitted to the Lord Lieutenant. It is now in the printer's hands, and will be

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01802"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill to extend to the city of Dublin the same facilities for licensed houses remaining open after closing hours as are enjoyed in this country under the Licensing Act of 1872. The only difference between the procedure proposed under this Bill and that in existence in this country is in regard to the authority by whom such extension of time may be granted. In London it is granted by the Police authority, and elsewhere in England by a Court of petty sessions. It is proposed that the authority in Dublin should be one of the three stipendiary magistrates, and it is thought that that will give additional security that these extensions will not be granted except on occasions when they are desirable. This Bill has come up from another place. It was amended in Committee there, and
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0301"/>
<col>593</col>
it is believed that in its present form it meets with the approval of the temperance party; at least, no opposition was offered to it in the House of Commons, and the Government believe that the Bill carries out a very desirable reform.

It will certainly remove what undoubtedly is a hardship in the city of Dublin, and I hope your Lordships will be prepared to give it a Second Reading.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01807"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will excuse me if I interpose for a few moments in respect of this Bill. I am aware that you have other matter in anticipation which is of more interest to a great many members of your Lordships' House, but there is a point in convection with this Bill which I think ought to be taken note of. I say taken note of advisedly, because I am aware that no change can be made in the Bill in this House whatever may appear to have been overlooked in its composition. What I submit is that there is a case which has not been considered by the framers of the Bill, and which ought to have been taken into consideration in the settlement effected. It is a point which ought now to he settled, instead of being left to be discovered at a later time when it might be connected with very embarrassing circumstances.<lb/>
This Bill is of a far-reaching character. It not only provides for the ordinary Civil List of the Sovereign, but contains also provisions with respect to his children and even. a provision drafted in consideration of the marriage of the Prince of Wales. Still further, it provides for the contingency of the Prince of Wales dying after marriage and leaving the Princess of Wales a widow.<lb/>
<col>594</col>
It provides an income for the Princess of Wales in that event&#x2014;an event which we should all deplore. That partakes of what I may call a large family arrangement, and it is an unusual part of a. Civil List Bill. The arrangements to be made on the marriage of the eldest son of the Sovereign are usually left until that event is at hand. In this case there is no direct provision with respect to the marriage, though there is in the Bill the provision, to which I have called attention, with respect to the Princess of Wales if she is left a widow.<lb/>
I imagine that the reason no provision is made with respect to the Prince of Wales's marriage is that the Prince of Wales is in the enjoyment of the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, and those revenues have, thanks to very careful management, considerably increased. They now amount to something like&#x00A3;80,000 per annum, and may soon be expected to reach&#x00A3;100,000. It may be within the memory of your Lordships that when the late King was married&#x00A3;100,000 was the amount provided by Parliament for his household maintenance, made up of the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall and such sum as it was then necessary for Parliament to vote. The sum of&#x00A3;100,000 was then regarded as sufficient for the establishment of the married Heir Apparent. I suppose it is thought that the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, which will soon reach that amount, may be left as the future endowment of the Heir Apparent when he married.<lb/>
It becomes, therefore, necessary to consider what is the situation of the Duchy of Cornwall and the law governing its passage by descent. The Duchy of Cornwall differs from other dignities in this country. It is not only the creation of the Royal prerogative. It is really by adoption, if not by creation, a Parliamentary institution; and the Duchy is limited to the <i>flius primogenitus</i> of the Crown. That has, of course, received construction in the course of the centuries that have since elapsed. The question arose whether, supposing the eldest born son of the King died in youth, the second born son became <i>primogenitus</i>. It is now conclusively established that the second born son in these circumstances becomes <i>primogenitus</i> in law and succeeds t o the Duchy of Cornwall. The point arose in conned ion with Henry VIII, on the death of his brother,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0302"/>
<col>595</col>
Prince Arthur, a case in regard to which there was a conflict of testimony. The point arose again on the death of Henry, the eldest son of James I. In that case it was decided that Charles, afterwards Charles I., became <i>flius primogenitus</i>, and he became Duke of Cornwall and enjoyed the revenues of the Duchy. Our present King also was the second born son of his predecessor. That was devolution from brother to brother.<lb/>
But there is another case which might become of great practical importance, which is not recognised in the Bill, and which, apparently, has not been in the consideration of the draftsman. If the eldest son of the King dies, leaving not only a widow but a son, does that son become <i>flius primogenitus</i>? It is well recognised in our legal history that the son does not succeed the father in this case, as the brother succeeds the brother. It is a contingency which we all hope will never happen in this case, yet it is one which within the sad experience of many of your Lordships has happened. We all know instances in which the eldest son has died in the lifetime of his father, leaving a grandson to be the heir to the grandfather. But in the case of Royalty that grandson would not succeed to the revenue of the Duchy of Cornwall. The Black Prince died in the lifetime of his father, and Richard of Bordeaux did not succeed to the Duchy of Cornwall, although he was, by a singular anomaly, created after his father's death both Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall.<lb/>
In the history of our Royal Family an instance has occurred much more near to us. On the death of Frederick Prince of Wales in the lifetime of George II, Frederick's son, afterwards George III, was created Prince of Wales, but did not succeed to the Duchy of Cornwall and never enjoyed the revenues of the Duchy, and those revenues, under the legal interpretation of the Statute creating the Duchy, reverted to the King. The consequence is that if such an unhappy event occurred as the death of the present Prince of Wales, and he left a son, the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, which would amount to&#x00A3;100,000 or more, would pass to the King, leaving the grandson unprovided for. The King would receive an immediate addition of about&#x00A3;100,000 a year to his Civil List, practically doubling his Privy
<col>596</col>
Purse. No doubt if such an event happened steps would have to be taken to provide for the contingency; but it is rather remarkable that this contingency, which might become one of considerable importance, is not provided for in this Bill. I cannot but think that this contingency, somehow or other, did not come within the contemplation of the framers of this Bill. They overlooked it perhaps. When the surrender of the Royal estates was effected for the purposes of the Civil List, there would have been no hesitation, I imagine, in coupling with it a surrender of this contingent remainder, this being made, of course, the basis of an arrangement for the sustentation of the children of the Prince of Wales in the unfortunate event of the Prince of Wales dying in the lifetime of his father. That would have been within the scope of this Bill according to the idea in which it has been framed. But nothing, of course, can be done now. I thought it right, however, to draw your Lordships' attention to the point, so that in future, if it ever became possible to reconsider it, the matter might be taken in hand, and that it might at all events be prepared for by knowledge beforehand. It ought not to be dealt with in circumstances when ignorance and other conditions might exist which would render a settlement agreeable to all parties at that time a matter of some difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01808"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in his interesting speech my noble friend has alluded to a possible, though not, I think, a probable contingency, and one which I sincerely hope may never occur. The point, as I understand it, which he has raised is whether provision should be made to meet the contingency of the eldest son of the Sovereign dying during the lifetime of the Sovereign and leaving a son. In such a case, although the son would be Heir Apparent to the Throne, he would not be Duke of Cornwall, nor would he be entitled to the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall. Under the Charter the settlement of the Duchy of Cornwall is limited to the eldest son of the King. Under the present practice the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, when there is no Duke of Cornwall, go to the Crown; and I may mention that Queen Victoria enjoyed this revenue for the first four years of her reign, before the birth of King Edward. The point has been raised elsewhere with a view to making some provision for diminishing
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0303"/>
<col>597</col>
the amount of the Civil List in case the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall, on such a contingency happening, were paid to the Crown; but this contingency is so remote that I think it might be left to be dealt with by Parliament when the occasion arose, if ever it did arise. It was much less remote in 1901, when this matter was before. Parliament, than it is now, and it was not considered necessary to make any alteration then; and still less, I think, is it needful to make any alteration at the present time. Therefore, even were this House able to make any alteration, I doubt whether your Lordships would desire that it should be made.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ACCESSION DECLARATION BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01810" align="center">[SECOND READING].</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01811">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01812"><member>LORD KINNAIRD</member> had given notice, on the Order for the Second Reading being read, to move that the consideration of the Bill be postponed until after the autumn recess. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I think you will agree that the point to which I desire to call your attention is one at all events worthy of consideration&#x2014;namely, whether there has been sufficient time given to your Lordships to consider this Bill in its present form. The effect of this new Bill as it now appears before your Lordships is to get rid of all effective tests against the accession of a Roman Catholic Monarchy. The cancn law of the Church of Rome allows a dispensation for oaths, but not for a denial of doctrine. That is why we believe that it is necessary to retain the reference to 'doctrines which appears in the present Declaration. The principal pretext for haste has been the alleged desirability of relieving his present Majesty from the obligation to make the unamended Declaration. However, seeing that the Coronation is not till June next and that the re-assembly of Parliament on November 15 will not necessitate His Majesty's presence, there is ample time to alter the Declaration, if desirable, long before his Majesty may be called to make it. So that there can be no adequate motive for dealing with the Bill now.</p>
<col>598</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01813">When we conic to consider the nature of the Bill this haste seems all the more improper. Whatever the exact value of the Declaration may be it certainly is a question of fundamental constitutional importance. The legal title of the House of Hanover and its heirs to the Throne depends upon the Statutes which require the Sovereign to be Protestant. The sole document that fixes the meaning of that very elastic term "Protestant" is the Declaration. In revising that Declaration we are recasting the very first Article of the constitutional compact which now so happily binds the Crown and people together. However estimable the proposed revision may be, it ought not to be sanctioned by this House until it has received the most careful attention from all points of view. Yet I venture to say that there has been no such attention given to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01814">Let us consider the history of the Bill. Within forty-eight hours of the death of our late beloved King, Mr. W. Redmond wrote a letter to the Premier asking him to take steps to alter the Accession Declaration. An invitation of this kind coming from this source could not be refused by one in the painful position of the present Prime Minister. Obediently, therefore, on June 28 he introduced a Bill to alter the declaration to an affirmation that the Sovereign is a&#x2014;
<quote>"faithful member of the Protestant Reformed Church by law established in England."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01815">In introducing the Bill the Premier said&#x2014;
<quote>"I would earnestly deprecate at this stage anything in the nature of prolonged or acrimonious discussion. I think it is most desirable that hon. Members should study the Bill, and ample opportunity will be given before the Second Reading."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01816">The Bill passed its First Reading, but received a chorus of condemnation. High Anglicans did not like the English Church to be called "Protestant and Reformed." Liberationists were up in arms against the phrase "established by law." Scotsmen did not intend the words "in England" to pass without opposition. Non-Anglicans felt offended at the selection of the Church of England. Above all, the great mass of convinced Protestant feeling was hostile to a formula so futile as that suggested. Enthusiastic meetings were held all over the country, floods of letters, resolutions, and remonstrances poured in upon Members of Parliament, and not without effect. The Government suddenly
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0304"/>
<col>599</col>
announced that the Bill would not be held over to the autumn, but hurried through all the remaining stages in three days, at the fag-end of an outworn sitting; and this was in violation of the pledge given to provide "ample opportunities." The diminution of the Government majority at each stage of the Bill&#x2014;341, First Reading; 326, Second Reading; and only 193 on the Third Reading&#x2014;proves how unpopular the change is. At the Third Reading the Government, with the aid of the Leader of the Opposition, only secured 215 votes for its Bill. This means that, disregarding the Nationalists and other Roman Catholic members, there were but 160 men in the House of Commons who would give their support to the Bill now before us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01817">When the Second Reading came up on July 27 the Premier said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am going to make a suggestion, and only a suggestion, in order to see&#x2026; how it is received and entertained in various quarters in the course of the debate."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01818">He then suggested that the Declaration should be altered to the statement, "I am a faithful Protestant." This mooted change elicited from Mr. Hilaire Belloc, himself a Roman Catholic, the criticism that&#x2014;
<quote>"As a matter of fact we are now discussing a new Bill."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01819">The Bill went into Committee on the 28th, and what had till then been a tentative suggestion by the Premier was adopted about midnight as almost the last stage of Committee amendment. The Bill thus amended was introduced for Third Reading on the 29th, shortly before 1 p.m., and was passed at 3.25 p.m. My Lords, the formula we are asked to enact has never been before the country, and it has received but two and a-half hours discussion in the House of Commons. If ever there was a clear case for the Second Chamber to justify its position by saving the country from the danger of ill-considered legislation surely this is the occasion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01820">There can be no real doubt that the people are not in favour of the Government interfering at all with the Declaration. The only election that has happened since it was suggested to alter the declaration has been at Kirkdale, the Member for which division said&#x2014;
<quote> "My recent election&#x2026;was specially fought out on the matter now before the House."</quote></p>
<col>600</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01821">He then went on to say that he and his constituents&#x2014;
<quote>"desire tint no change whatever should be made in the Declaration."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01822">Petitions signed by more than 2,000.000 people have been presented to the House of Commons. Every speaker against the Bill made a strong point of the popular feeling against it, and there was no serious attempt to answer the statement. Indeed, its truth was admitted. The Premier said that such a proposal as he was making must inevitably give rise to a considerable amount of misunderstanding, and, indeed, of angry hostility. Mr. Balfour said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am not unmoved by what I admit to be the great pressure of public opinion. Like everybody else I have been overwhelmed by letters on the subject, and I do not in the least doubt those of my friends who say that there is an overwhelmingly strong popular feeling against any change."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01823">Mr. Henry Chaplin said&#x2014;
<quote>"I do believe that the Prime Minister and his colleagues underrate very greatly the depth of the feeling which undoubtedly prevails among vast numbers of the British people in connection with this question. Nor do I think we need be surprised at that when we remember what has happened in the history of the past. I think, therefore, it was wrong, and that it was altogether foolish to ignore that feeling in the way the Government have ignored it, and to have prosecuted this Bill, and conducted it in the manner in which they have conducted it."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01824">Even the Chief Secretary for Ireland's exuberant good spirits did not prevent his admitting the existence of this popular disapprobation in a manner more forcible than polite, and garnished with <i>obiter dicta</i> unnecessary to repeat. The Bill was opposed by such men as Sir A. AclandHood, Mr. Henry Chaplin, Mr. A. Akers-Douglas, Mr. C. Scott-Dickson, and Mr. Walter Long. Assuredly these are not men who would refuse any measure of reform that is compatible with the security of the British Constitution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01825">Very significant indeed was the manner in which the haste of the Government was censured by a supporter of their own, and by a supporter of the Bill. Mr. Gibson Bowles said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have a great deal of sympathy with the complaint of the right hon. gentleman opposite as to the insufficiency of the time granted for so important a matter as that before the House. It is one of the gravest matters that could occupy the attention of Parliament, and I think that three weeks rather than three days should have been allotted to it."</quote></p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0305"/>
<col>601</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01826">Lord Hugh Cecil said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am a strong supporter of the Bill, and I also support the Prime Minister's Amendment. But&#x2026;never was a Bill managed as this Bill has been managed. The Government left an immense interval between the First and Second Readings. They left no interval between the Second Reading and the Committee stage, which is much more important and much more desirable. In fact, my hon. friends are perfectly entitled to complain that they have been treated in a way quite unparalleled in Parliamentary history, and inconsistent with the statement of the Prime Minister when he introduced the Bill."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01827">The question, therefore, which I venture to submit to your Lordships is this, Are we going to be a party to the further stifling of public discussion upon this matter merely to meet the wishes of those who do not want this discussion to go forward? I believe with Mr. Long that if there had been more time given for the consideration of this question, and fuller opportunity for those outside Parliament to inform themselves as to what it is proposed to do, and to make up their minds as to the way in which they would like it to be done, it would have been possible, after the fuller time given for consideration, to find phraseology which would have met with general support. I have described the procedure whereby the present Bill has been forced through the Lower House, and I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask your Lordships not to sanction the indecent haste of the Government in this matter, but to suspend judgment until you have been able calmly and adequately to consider this measure, which touches a fundamental security for the Protestant Succession.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01829"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that my noble friend will not press this Motion to a Division, or, if he does, that your Lordships will not support him. We all recognise the earnestness with which he approaches this subject, but I think, as the discussion proceeds, I shall be able to show that the fears which he has expressed are altogether groundless. Perhaps I might, before I deal with the subject-matter of the noble Lord's Motion, point out that he contravened in a somewhat more open manner than is usual in your Lordships' House
<col>602</col>
the Standing Order&#x2014;which is not always respected but which generally receives at any rate some outward consideration&#x2014;which forbids a noble Lord to read his speech.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, what is the object which the noble Lord has in view in asking us to postpone the consideration of this measure? Is it that more general light may be thrown on the subject? The whole subject was discussed at great length in the year 1901, and ever since then has occupied the earnest thought of the Government of the day. In saying this I speak&#x2014;I think I may do so without hesitation&#x2014;for noble Lords opposite as much as I do for noble Lords on this Bench. The noble Lord said that it was at the bidding of an hon. gentleman in another place, Mr. William Redmond, that this Bill was introduced. I have no doubt that. Mr. William Redmond, like all other Irish Catholics and also like all English Catholics, is and has been extremely anxious that this Declaration should be abolished or amended; but if the noble Lord thinks that Mr. William Redmond has had anything to do with the introduction of this Bill, I can assure him that he is altogether mistaken. I have myself been considerably concerned in this matter, and it was not until I saw in some newspaper that Mr. Redmond bad written to the Prime Minister that I was aware that such was the ease.<lb/>
I can assure the noble Lord that during-the lifetime of his late Majesty, when we had no thought or fear that the consideration of the subject would be made so imminent as it unhappily was, we were-steadily considering what could be done to deal with it. I think the noble Lord has forgotten what, has passed in this-House. We held out hopes of being able to deal with the matter, but our hopes were frustrated, and so much disappointment was felt by many noble Lords in this. House that I remember the noble Duke opposite (the Duke of Norfolk) departed from his usual moderation of language in describing our conduct in not taking up the matter and dealing with it at once. Consequently I cannot admit that any reason for postponement exists by necessity for further general discussion of the subject.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord pointed out that the Bill has not come up to this House
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0306"/>
<col>603</col>
in the form in which it was introduced in another place. That is perfectly true. As the Bill was introduced in the other House the Sovereign was asked to declare that he was a "faithful member of the Protestant Reformed Church by law established in England." Various objections were taken in quite different quarters to that formula&#x2014;objections which when. we considered them we admitted had weight, and which decided us to find, if possible, some other formula, to which those objections would not apply. But in its main lines I would remind the noble Lord that the Declaration in the present Bill follows the general lines, though not the precise form, of the Bill as introduced. His Majesty's Government in the first place decided that the Declaration should be positive and not negative&#x2014;that is to say, that it should contain a statement of faith, but not a repudiation or denunciation of any particular article of faith of another Church, and in that respect the two formulas followed the same line. In fact the Declaration in the Schedule, if you examine it closely, will be found to convey in other words precisely the same sense as the earlier form.<lb/>
I should like to know what is the hope which the noble Lord and his friends entertain in asking us to postpone the consideration of this question. Do they hope to find better words then those in the Bill? The whole subject has been considered in public and private, as I say, continuously for the last ten years, and it frequently happens in such a case, when a question becomes a matter of public discussion in Parliament and the various views of different people affected or supposed to be affected are stated and considered, that at last by common consent some form of words is reached which contains the fewest possible objections, and that is what we claim to have found in this case. I cannot help thinking that the hope of the noble Lord is of rather a different kind&#x2014;namely, that after the matter is postponed somehow or other Parliament may be&#x2014;perhaps I ought not to say intimidated&#x2014;but at any rate worried, into dropping the whole subject. Certainly we do not intend to countenance anything of that kind; and whatever took place in that sense we should certainly feel bound in. the circumstances to proceed with the consideration of our Bill.<lb/>
<col>604</col>
If there is one thing more evident than another, it is that popular opinion, as expressed in the House of Commons, is desirous of clearing this question out of the way. This Bill as it comes to your Lordships has been passed by enormous majorities, and the noble Lord, who quoted very freely from the debates in another place, omitted to state what happened on the Third Reading, when members of all parties, so to speak, fell into each others arms and expressed themselves as highly satisfied with the result, and the Bill came forward with general approbation. I firmly believe that once this Bill is passed it w ill receive the general assent of the country, and it will receive it for this reason&#x2014;as I shall hope to show if we are allowed to proceed with this discussion&#x2014;that the idea which the noble Lord has expressed that this change involves any shadow of risk to the Protestant Succession to the Throne is absolutely without any foundation whatever. That being so, I ask your Lordships to proceed to the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01830"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Lord who has moved this Motion will not press it to a Division, and I take the opportunity also of expressing the wish that the Bill itself will be passed by your Lordships and returned to the House of Commons without amendment. But I must deprecate the statement of the noble Lord who moved this Motion when he put it to your Lordships that the topic of this Bill had not been considered adequately by the country or by the Houses of Parliament. In this House it has been discussed several times, and attention has been called to it on other occasions. That has been going on with long intervals but still continuously for nine years, and those of your Lordships who recollect the debates that have taken place will remember what interest was evidenced in this question.<lb/>
It really is not true from an historical aspect to say that this matter has not received adequate attention. It has been before the country not nine years, but 220 years. For 220 years it has been like iron entering into the soul of the Catholics in this Kingdom, who in the past have been deprived of all the privileges of citizenship, deprived of the franchise, deprived even of their seats in this House, for it was not until the year 1829, which is not very
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0307"/>
<col>605</col>
long ago in the history of England, that six Catholic Peers were allowed for the first time to take their seats in this House. I am not going to enter again into the merits of this question. It has been thoroughly discussed in your Lordships' House on many occasions. Sometimes I have addressed your Lordships&#x2014;or, perhaps, more strictly speaking the empty benches of your Lordships' House&#x2014;upon it myself, and sometimes I have received an answer from the Government that the matter would be attended to. Not so very long ago I received a disappointing answer to the effect that the Government would not be able to pursue the matter at all. But a happier day, a more auspicious day, has arrived, when the Government come forward of their own accord and offer to remove the grievances, or at least the chief grievance, of which we complain.<lb/>
If an Amendment could be moved to this Bill with any success, I would move it myself, and the Amendment would be that the Declaration should be totally abolished and for ever. I believe I am speaking correctly in stating that that was the view of the Prime Minister himself. But that view has not been backed up by the country. You see now in the Bill a form of words which certainly cannot give grave offence to any person who raised objections to the infamous and blasphemous wording of the former Declaration. The t hanks of the Catholic portion of this Empire are due to the Government for having done this thing; and I venture to think that Mr. Asquith will go down to posterity as the first who has tackled and wrestled with this subject and brought it to a satisfactory conclusion. I may perhaps, without impertinence, I hope, call special attention to the words of one of the members of the Government&#x2014;words which, I think, precipitated this solution of the question and brought about this happy consummation. A year ago&#x2014;on August 5, 1909&#x2014;the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack uttered these memorable words&#x2014;
<quote>"I think it thoroughly wrong for any Government to compel a Sovereign or any other man to insult the religious opinions held sacred by any person in this Kingdom."</quote>
I consider that those words were really the final blow which this Declaration of 220 years standing received in this Kingdom, and we Catholics cannot be too grateful or thankful to the noble and learned Lord
<col>606</col>
for what he said on that occasion and for the outcome of it. It would be unfair also not to quote the words of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, for on the prior occasion that this subject was before us&#x2014;I think not more titan two years ago&#x2014;he said that if the Government were to bring in a Bill dealing with the subject it would receive his benevolent consideration.

<image src="S5LV0006P0I0308"/>
<col>607</col>
thank the House for having allowed the Bill to proceed. As I said in speaking upon the noble Lord's proposal, this is no new question. It is one, indeed, which has given cause for much anxiety to more than one Government of recent years. I may remind your Lordships, very briefly, of what took place in 1901 when Lord Salisbury was leading the House and when a serious attempt was made to deal with this question, though only to a limited extent. It was supposed at that time that the objections entertained to the existing Declaration could be met by some slight verbal alterations in its form, and that in substance it might stand, although the more offensive expressions in the Declaration were removed. Accordingly a.. Committee was appointed, of which I, by the way, happened to be a member, to deal with the question on those lines; but it did not fall within the competence of that Committee either to recommend the abolition of the Declaration altogether, or even to substitute an entirely new form of Declaration, as has been done in this instance. I think that in some respects it was fortunate that those limitations were imposed upon that Committee, because I have always held, and indeed have stated more than once in this House, that if there was to be any question either of the abolition of the Declaration or of its fundamental alteration, the step ought to be taken upon the responsibility of the Government of the day, and that a Committee of your Lordships' House or of the other House, or, indeed, a Joint Committee, would not be the best body to frame by discussion a form of words. The Government have now undertaken the responsibility of offering a form of words to Parliament, and it is that form of words which we ask you to sanction this evening.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01838">I really do not know that at this time of day it is necessary to trouble your Lordships with any historical review of the origin of this Declaration. I need only remind you that in the year 1689, after the great political convulsion of the previous year, it was decided that the Sovereign for the first time should he asked to take a general Declaration which had been imposed in the reign of Charles II, upon all persons who desired to sit or who were otherwise competent to sit in either House of Parliament, and all persons who exer-
<col>608</col>
cised the public trust of any office. That was the simple historical origin of the Declaration, and it is that Declaration, the terms of which arc so familiar to your Lordships that I need not repeat them, that we now desire to alter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01839">Now, my Lords, what are the objections to the alteration? They are of two kinds. One kind it is easy to understand, but impossible to sympathise with. It is that which takes the form of saying&#x2014;to put it briefly&#x2014;that, "even if Roman Catholics do feel themselves insulted by the present form of the Declaration, it is only what they deserve; they are the kind of people to whom no consideration should be extended, they are themselves intolerant and ought not to ask for any toleration from others." That point of view is, of course, founded on much that has happened in the history of our country, and we know to what lengths and excesses religious animosity may take people. We know that in history wars of religion have exceeded in their ferocity, and in their duration, almost any wars of acquisition or of conquest. But what we say is that, so far as that spirit exists in this country to this day, and so far as it animates the opposition to this measure, it is not a spirit which we will do anything but discourage to the utmost of our power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01840">The second objection is one with which we can sympathise, but which, on the other hand, it is difficult to understand&#x2014;namely, that the alteration of the Declaration lessens the security for the Protestant Succession to the Throne. What are the safeguards for the Protestant Succession?' They are set out in this White Paper [Cd. 5271] which has been distributed to your Lordships and which many of you have doubtless read. In the first place, there are the two enactments of 1689. There is that great measure which for some reason which I do not know, although it is one of the important Acts on the Statute Book, still retains the designation of the "Bill of Rights." That is one of our great constitutional safeguards. In the same year was passed the Bill involving the taking on the Coronation of the Sovereign of the Oath by which the Sovereign swears to maintain the Protestant reformed religion established by law. Then in 1701 came the Act of Settlement, the general safeguards of which against the Sovereign either becoming or marrying a Roman
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0309"/>
<col>609</col>
Catholic are familiar to all your Lordships and which also prescribes that&#x2014;
<quote>"whoever shall hereafter come to the possession of this Crown shall join in communion with the Church of England as by law established."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01841">And then in the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707 further safeguards, which I need not recite, are provided. These are, though I speak of them with all respect, the paper safeguards for the Protestant Succession. I call them paper safeguards because what Parliament has done Parliament can undo; and we all know very well that the real safeguard for the Protestant Succession is the deliberate determination of the vast majority of the people of this country&#x2014;a determination quite as strong as ever it Was in the seventeenth or eighteenth century&#x2014;that a Roman Catholic shall not sit on the Throne of this country. This is due partly to reasons of an historical character well known to your Lordships, and partly, no doubt, because the Roman Catholic Church is not merely a body of persons professing a particular faith or even desirous of propagating that faith, but is also a great organised polity coming into contact at a hundred points with the civil and even the domestic life of any nation within which it is dominant. Those are the reasons which have determined and do determine the people of this country in the maintenance of the Protestant Succession.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01842">That being so, it might be asked why any further personal declaration on the part of the Sovereign is necessary to achieve that end. I confess that I should not mind, and I think many others would not mind, if this particular Declaration were abolished altogether. In one sense it is not needed. But, on the other hand, it is no doubt another matter altogether to drop a safeguard, if safeguard it be, which has existed for more than 200 years, and the abolition of which would undoubtedly excite fears&#x2014;not, I think, reasonable fears&#x2014;in the minds of a considerable number of His Majesty's subjects. As regards this particular form of the Declaration, there is only, I think, one argument with which it is necessary to deal&#x2014;one argument which can be said to have substance. This is that the proposed Declaration is not a real safeguard because it might be taken by a Roman Catholic, whereas the Declaration which is still the law of the land could not be so taken. That, I gather, was the attitude taken up
<col>610</col>
by my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Kinnaird) when he made his Motion. I believe that statement to be absolutely groundless. I have no right to speak for members of the Roman Catholic Church&#x2014;there are plenty here who are most competent to do so for themselves&#x2014;but I should be very greatly surprised if any one belonging to that Church could say that this is a. Declaration which any honest Roman Catholic could take, and furthermore that he could say that there was any power of absolving from or dispensing with any moral penalties of perjury in possession of any ecclesiastical authority. I do not believe for a moment that any such power exists. Whatever may be the dispensing power of the Pope or of the Church, I cannot believe for an instant that there is any dispensing power&#x2014;and it seems to me ridiculous to suppose that there can be&#x2014;in a great moral organisation like the Church of Rome, which would allow a man to undertake deliberate perjury and dispense him from all moral consequences of that act. Of course, if a man is prepared to undertake deliberate perjury, whet her he be Sovereign or whether he be subject, no Declaration, certainly not the existing one, will prevent him from doing so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01843">We then had to consider what form the amended Declaration should take. As I have already stated, we decided&#x2014;and in this we undoubtedly departed from what appeared to be the general sense in the year 1901&#x2014;that it would be both wise and safe to make the Declaration take a positive and not a repudiating form. I believe I am right in saying, and I do not think I shall be contradicted by any noble Lord who is a Roman Catholic, that no negative form which involved the picking out for denunciation or repudiation particular doctrines dear to the Roman Catholic Church would have been accepted by them as any solution of the question. I need not argue that point at length, but it is evident that although the actual terms might not have been as strong or as offensive as they are in the existing Declaration, the sense of Roman Catholics would have been deeply wounded by the retention of any form of that kind. Therefore, as we thought we could do so with perfect safety, we decided to abandon that feature. The Sovereign in this Declaration as we have framed it declares himself to be a faithful Protestant. In that sense lie does more in the way of stating
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0310"/>
<col>611</col>
his religious faith than he does in the Declaration prescribed by the Bill of Rights, and in so describing himself he also&#x2014;and I defy contradiction of this&#x2014;in the most explicit terms possible describes himself as not being a Roman Catholic. Whatever may be said of the precise meaning of the word "Protestant," it is no doubt the one most direct antithesis which can be found to the term Roman Catholic. The Sovereign describes himself as a Protestant, and the Act of Settlement says that he must join in communion with the Church of England. I do not propose to discuss the question as to what the precise obligation prescribed by those words may be; but at any rate I do not think that any one will be found to say that in describing himself as a faithful Protestant he goes outside or beyond the prescription in the Act of Settlement, because I do not think any one here will be found to deny that although the Church of England is Catholic in spiritual truth, she is also Protestant in historical fact. What we have to decide is, Is this form a satisfactory one in itself? If your Lordships think so, as I trust you may, you will read this Bill a second time and pass it through its remaining stages.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01844">There are only two other points to which I wish to allude. The first is the active desire of many Protestants, and among those are many Protestants who would be thought to be, I will not say hostile, but most opposed to the Roman Catholic Church, for an amendment of this Declaration. I have in my hand a copy of a resolution which has the signatures of upwards of 2,000 Irish Protestants, and which was adopted at a meeting held in Dublin on July 19. It is in the following terms&#x2014;
<quote>"That we members of churches and religious bodies in Ireland not in communion with the Church of Rome, believing that the form of words in which the Sovereign is required to repudiate certain doctrines is just cause of offence to many of His Majesty's subjects and repugnant to Christian courtesy, do earnestly desire such alteration in the form of words as shall remove that grievance without in any way lessening the securities of the Protestant Succession."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01845">This is signed by high dignitaries of the Church in Ireland, by University professors, by many Nonconformist ministers, by members of the professional classes, by country gentlemen, and by a number of people engaged in trade; and it seems to me to do the highest credit to its authors,
<col>612</col>
and is, I think, a remarkable instance of the high and right spirit which may prevail in a country in which we are always taught to suppose that religious animosity runs higher than it does here, and in which people are apt to be earmarked and divided off according to the creed which they profess. That is one point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01846">Then there is another point which appeals deeply to me in the office which I hold, and that is the feeling on this subject all over the Empire. There are many noble Lords here&#x2014;I see some opposite&#x2014;who have held high office in the Dominions, and there is a noble Lord who is not here tonight&#x2014;Earl Grey&#x2014;who independently, long before there was any question of his holding his present office, took a deep interest in this subject, and who is now Governor-General of Canada with its two-and-a-quarter millions of Roman Catholic subjects of the King, every one of whom will be awaiting the result of your Lordships' deliberations to-day. Then in Australasia there are upwards of 1,000,000 Catholics, of whom the same can be said. Many of them have held high public office. They are among the most loyal subjects of the Crown, and many of them have fought side by side with their Protestant fellow-subjects in war. I ask you, Is it possible, in view of all that has happened, to refuse this boon which involves no risk whatever to the Protestant Succession, which frees the Sovereign from a most odious and painful obligation, and the news of which will gladden the hearts of some 12,000,000 of our fellow-subjects throughout the Empire?</p>

<image src="S5LV0006P0I0311"/>
<col>613</col>
For the solution which the Bill suggests, for the form which the Declaration takes as it appears in the Schedule, I accept my share of personal responsibility, a share rightly ascribed to me by the Prime Minister when he made his speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday last. Before Mr. Asquith made that speech I had written to him on behalf of myself and one or two others in high position in the Church whom at a few hours notice I had been able to consult, to say that I and they were prepared to support an enactment which should take this particular form. That decision was not lightly taken or communicated. It was very far from being a policy of what could be called peace at any price. It was very far from being a declaration that any words which should be inoffensive to Roman Catholics would do. That was not at all my attitude then, nor is it now. Had the Bill with the Declaration in the Schedule come before your Lordships in the form in which it was introduced I should have felt bound to take exception to its phraseology. The King was, in taking that Declaration, made to say&#x2014;
<quote>"I am a faithful member of the Protestant Reformed Church by law established in England."</quote>
I should have taken exception to those words, not with a desire to find fault with their intent, not because I or anybody could think that the words would be discourteous to our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects, not because they would necessarily be ineffective, but because they would have given by statutory enactment a perfectly new designation to the Church of England and would have given it in a formal way without any adequate reason.<lb/>
Instead of the words "Church of England," simple, well-understood words, we should have had what is, in my view, a mere circumlocutory phrase adopted to allay susceptibilities, but most misleading if it were intended to define and accurately describe that branch of the Church of Christ with which by the clear and definite requirements of the Act of Settlement, as quoted more than once by the Prime Minister, the King must join in communion. There is a perfectly true sense in which the word Protestant is rightly applied to the Church of England and has been applied to it for many centuries. There is no doubt that the Church of England is, in the historical sense of the word, Reformed, but the words Protestant Reformed as a
<col>614</col>
title are neither distinctive nor exclusive, and certainly they are not co-extensive with the true character of that portion of the Church Catholic which has claimed and held the allegiance of the great mass of the English people. I could have made this clear, had it been necessary, but happily it is quite unnecessary now. I felt bound, however, to mention the fact lest it should be supposed now or hereafter that we looked lightly on the choice of the words used, or that we had given adherence to these words without adequate criticism or consideration.<lb/>
About the form of words actually adopted I shall say something before I sit down. But I desire first to say something quite briefly about the object, the history, and the necessity of our asking the King to make some such Declaration as this. I think that half the misunderstandings that have arisen and half the heat which has been engendered in this controversy might have been avoided if people had throughout taken in and remembered that, paradoxical as it may appear, even the most doctrinal words in the Declaration which has been in use for more than two centuries were political rather than religious, both in their intent and in their effect. The words about such solemn subjects as Transubstantiation and what is popularly called Mariolatry were put there not primarily for religious purposes, not primarily in order to safeguard or secure the sacramental or devotional belief of the thousands who have had to make the Declaration and to subscribe to it, but they were put there and used to safeguard the political loyalty of those who used them. In the reign of Charles II it was found&#x2014;perhaps I should be more charitable if I said firmly believed &#x2014;that if you wished to make sure that a man was not under allegiance, public or secret, avowed or unavowed, to Rome you must use a form of words which would be incompatible on doctrinal grounds with membership of the Church of Rome.<lb/>
Those who are familiar with the detailed history of that very curious period, the reign of Charles II, or with the biographical story of that extraordinary Monarch, will have no difficulty in understanding why that view was so firmly held. I am not speaking of what are known as the Titus Oates years, 1678&#x2014;the years of the Plot, if there were a plot, and of the panic,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0312"/>

as there certainly was a panic&#x2014;I am speaking of eight or nine years earlier than that &#x2014;the secret Treaty of Dover, <i>Le Traite de Madame</i>, signed in the summer of 1670, the private negotiations carried on by Charles and his sister, the madame of the plot, with Louis XIV, the King's solemn but absolutely secret undertaking to the Church of Rome, notwithstanding the equally solemn undertakings he had made to his own Parliament and people, and the knowledge, this is an important point, that in these transactions many public men were implicated as fully as the King, and so on. These were the things which, as they glimmered into light and public knowledge, made both Parliament and people resolve to impose, first on public servants, secondly on Members of Parliament, and thirdly on the Sovereign, a test more binding than any mere promise, and a test which every one believed and knew to be absolutely incompatible even then with membership of the Church of Rome.<lb/>
With all respect to the historical knowledge and acumen of the Prime Minister, who spoke last week of the Declaration as "framed in the excitement produced by the Popish Plot" (and I think the noble Earl who has just sat clown used words not very different), I would point out that, though the final form was given to the words then, the substance and the character of the enactment belong to quite earlier years before Titus Oates had been heard of. It is important for the sake of historical accuracy and for the credit of the statesmen of that day to point this out in view of the somewhat loose and inaccurate statements which are widely current that these words were "the panic-stricken outcome of Titus Oates's fabrications and the fancied Popish Plot."<lb/>
But that is all past history. The very difference of conditions between now and then, the difference of atmosphere, the difference of the public standard of personal honour as regards declarations, and the difference as regards mutual confidence, are the amplest justification for translating the wording of the old Declaration into the wording of the new. Under modern conditions of thought, the conditions of to-day, under modern modes of expression, the modes of expression of to-day, a man would be, in my judgment, as clearly bound by the Declaration in its new form as in the old. The very notion nowadays
<col>616</col>
of a King or public man being able first, say, to make such promises as Charles II made at his Accession and then to negotiate, plot, and sign w hat he did in favour of the Church of Rome is not merely unlikely but it is absolutely unthinkable. I am absolutely convinced that when the Sovereign to-day makes the new Declaration&#x2014;
<quote>"I am a faithful Protestant, and I will, according to the true intent of the enactments which secure the Protestant succession to the Throne of my Realm, uphold and maintain the said enactments to the best of my powers according to law,"</quote>
we secure for the twentieth century everything that was secured 230 years ago for the seventeenth century.<lb/>
One of the most curious elements of this controversy is that for 150 years down to 1829 all the members of both Houses took this Declaration, including all the Bishops. High Church Bishops like Bishop Wake and Bishop Gibson, profound thinkers like Bishop Butler, and scholars like Bishop Newton and Bishop Lloyd, took the Declaration as far as we know without a murmur. There is a perfect mine of interesting information about it in the debates of 1829 on the Roman Catholic Emancipation Bill. It is a mine which has been little explored by controversialists. I think I may congratulate the House and the country on that, for when we consider the luxuriant flood of literature which has poured upon us as things are, I tremble to think what might have been if that storehouse had been largely used. For example, there was the battle of giants in this House in the spring of 1829 between Lord Eldon on the one side and the learned High Church Bishop of Oxford, Bishop Lloyd, on the other side, dealing in detail with what was or was not meant or involved in the Declaration which each of them had taken several times in the course of his public life. I think these facts are worth referring to to-day, because they serve to show how opinions change about matters of phraseology from time to time and how absolutely unnecessary it is for us to use the phraseology of the seventeenth century to bring out what we wish to make clear in the twentieth century.<lb/>
I should like to say one closing word with regard to the actual phrasing of the formula which I hope we are now going to approve. The King is asked to declare, "I am a faithful Protestant." I could
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0313"/>
<col>617</col>
imagine occasions or circumstances in which it would be most inadequate and misleading to use these words in their naked simplicity&#x2014;occasions on which the question to be settled was the religious or doctrinal belief of the person using the words. If the words were used in that connection they would, though perfectly accurate so far as they go, require amplifying and safeguarding if they were to be adequate or even intelligible. These words, however, are not wanted for doctrinal purposes at all, but for ensuring that the person using them, while a Christian, is not a Roman Catholic. For that purpose the words are explicit, accurate, inoffensive, and they are completely consonant with the proper use of the word Protestant in the last two centuries. The word Protestant was used constantly in that connection by High Churchmen of that day&#x2014;by Archbishop Laud, Bishop Andrewes, Bishop Cosin, and many more. It would have been used by the founders seventy years ago of the great Oxford Movement&#x2014;the great Tractarians. I think that statement would perhaps be challenged in some quarters. It is absolutely true. I should like to give an example. When the Oxford Movement was in its origin several of the foremost leaders of the Movement met to draw up a Catechism, which I think is almost the only document which received the <i>imprimatur</i> of a considerable number of them. A portion of that Catechism they drew up in these words&#x2014;
<quote>Q.&#x2014;What do you mean by "the Church"?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;The society belonging to the Lord Christ.</quote>
Then, after several questions and answers about the definition of the Church as those who continue "in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship," the Catechism goes on as follows with reference to Roman Catholics, Nonconformists, and ourselves&#x2014;
<quote>Q.&#x2014;Do all Christians continue in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;No. Some hold to the fellowship and depart from the doctrine, corrupting it by alterations or additions; and some depart also from the fellowship, having lost the Apostolic Commission.</quote>
<quote>Q.&#x2014;What branches of the Church continue both in the doctrine and the fellowship?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;Those called Protestant Episcopal in England, Ireland, Scotland&#x2014;</quote>
That is a curious commentary upon the remarks which are often current to-day as to the character of the word Protestant used in connection with the Church of which most of your Lordships are members.<lb/>
Therefore, reduced to its simplest terms, the Declaration, for the specific purpose
<col>618</col>
for which it is wanted, says what needs saying; says it, <i>pace</i> my noble friend Lord Kinnaird, in a manner perfectly effective for its purpose, says it in a way that everybody can understand, and says it in terms which cannot hurt or wound the most sensitive adherent of the Roman Catholic Church. I believe we need a Declaration of this sort, not because the Protestant Succession is not adequately secured otherwise. I believe it is. As has been pointed out most cogently, the Bill of Rights, the Act of Settlement, the Coronation Oath, and other Acts which might be named seem to me to guarantee it absolutely. But it is needed because to abolish the Declaration altogether, would certainly and inevitably be misunderstood as implying on our part some new departure which there is not the slightest intention to make. For these reasons I hope your Lordships will now, with a unanimous voice, give a Second Reading to this Bill, and thus bring happily to an end a controversy about phrases which seem to me to have served their purpose and may now with perfect safety be replaced by these new words. Such a solution will be to the relief of the personal position of the gracious Sovereign of this Empire; it will be to the easing of the mind of reasonable controversialists on either side; and, I will add, it will be to the credit of Christian common sense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01849"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before this discussion proceeds further it may be convenient that a word should be said as to the manner in which this Bill is regarded by some, at all events, of those who sit in this part of the House. The noble Earl, in his interesting statement, reminded us that this question was not unfamiliar to us. It has been brought up again and again, and I do not think I am guilty of exaggeration when I say that on every one of those occasions there was disclosed a great preponderance, at any rate, of opinion in favour of a substantial alteration of the present Declaration. There was exhibited, unless I wholly misinterpret the speeches to which I have listened, a general desire that some form of Declaration should be discovered less offensive to the Roman Catholic subjects of the Crown and also less irksome and distasteful to the Sovereign into whose mouth these words were put. Those two things were, I think, desired subject to this reservation&#x2014;that nothing should be done
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0314"/>
<col>619</col>
which might have the effect of impairing public confidence in the safeguards for the Protestant Succession.<lb/>
What I may describe as the view of the House of Lords was, I think, well embodied in a Resolution which was carried here in the year 1904 on the motion of my noble friend Lord Jersey. The noble Duke who sits behind me (the Duke of Norfolk) had moved a Resolution which did not entirely find favour with all of us, and we carried, not his motion, but a Resolution, moved by Lord Jersey, which was to the following effect&#x2014;
<quote>"That this House while desirous that no expression unnecessarily offensive to any of his subjects should be required of the Sovereign on his Accession to the Throne is of opinion that nothing should be done to weaken the security of, the Protestant Succession."</quote>
That Resolution holds the field to-day, and I believe the two propositions which it embodies are propositions which at any rate a large majority of those who sit on this side of the House would be found ready to support.<lb/>
I think then that we cannot do better tonight than take up the question where we left it in 1904. The moment is opportune for so doing. We stand at the close of the reign of a Sovereign conspicuous above all for his broad-minded and considerate views towards all his subjects, no matter of what race or what religion; and at the beginning of a new reign, begun under the happiest auspices, the opening days of which we all desire should not be disfigured by the kind of animosities which would certainly be created were the unamended Declaration to be persevered in. I will not waste your Lordships' time by further reference to the old Declaration. It bas always seemed to me altogether indefensible, and I think the most rev. Primate was correct when he described to us the circumstances in which it had its origin, and pointed out how entirely the circumstances of the age in which we live differ from the circumstances of that remoter time.<lb/>
For one thing, surely our modern conception of the Empire over which our Sovereign rules is a wholly different conception from anything that was present to the minds of those who lived even one or two generations ago. How great the change has been even in our own days. It was not long ago that we were content to
<col>620</col>
describe the Sovereign of these islands as Queen of Britain and Defender of the Faith. A few years later she became, not only the Queen of Britain, but. the Empress of India; and now our Sovereign is not only King of Britain and Emperor of India, but King of all the Britains&#x2014;of the great overseas Dominions which form part of his realm. Could anything be more inappropriate, more needlessly offensive, than that we should single out from the 400 odd millions who are citizens of that Empire that comparatively small body of 12,000,000 of Roman Catholics in order to pass upon them, or, to speak more properly, upon two particular tenets of their faith, the kind of censure which is contained in the old Declaration? At the present time subjects of the Crown who may not only not belong to the Protestant faith, but may hold religions altogether alien to our own are eligible for the highest appointments under the Crown, administrative and judicial, in various parts of the world. There is nothing to prevent our having at this moment a Roman Catholic Viceroy of India, numbering among his advisers Hindus and Mahomedans. Can we, at such a moment as this, in circumstances such as these, single out the Roman Catholic faith as a subject for special repudiation and denunciation?<lb/>
Not only is the Declaration one offensive in its terms, but it seems to me open to objection on the ground of its futility. It does not touch other forms of infidelity. It does not meet the case of a Sovereign who might make the Declaration in deliberate bad faith. It does not touch the case of a Sovereign who, after he had been a few years on the Throne, might altogether change his religious tenets. The Declaration may have been suitable enough when it had to be taken by members of this House at the beginning of every Parliament; but what becomes of its efficacy when it has to be taken by the Sovereign once and for all, perhaps in extreme youth and at the beginning of a reign which may possibly last half a century? One may ask, if we have these feelings in regard to the Declaration, would it not be better to toss it on one side and rely upon the statutory safeguards which the noble Earl enumerated and which are undoubtedly of a very potent character? Those safeguards are certainly not wanting in completeness. The Bill of Rights excludes from the Throne any Sovereign who holds communion with the Church of Rome, and it not only does that,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0315"/>
<col>621</col>
but it absolves the subjects of that Sovereign from their allegiance to him. The Act of Settlement adds to these disabilities the further requirement that the occupant of the Throne shall he in communion with the Established Church. Then you have the Coronation Oath, in which the Sovereign promises to maintain the Protestant reformed religion established by law. Finally there is the safeguard contained in the Act of Union. The cumulative effect of these enactments seems to me to be immense; and I can well understand the feelings of some of my friends who would be content to leave the matter there, without adding to those safeguards the further safeguard of a personal Declaration from the Sovereign.<lb/>
But I do nevertheless believe as strongly as the noble Earl opposite that a personal Declaration is indispensable. I will tell your Lordships why. I believe that nothing but a. personal Declaration will satisfy the people of this country. Remember that a great many of them probably never have heard of the Acts of Parliament to which reference is made in these discussions. Probably very few of them have seen the White Paper which the noble Earl mentioned and which so admirably summarises the law in regard to the subject.<lb/>
Such persons will not be content without a Declaration of some kind. What then should be the nature of that Declaration? I venture to lay down two conditions. In the first place, I say its language should not be of a violent or offensive character. There are some people who seem to think that in order to secure the Protestant Succession it is enough to be extremely uncivil to the Pope. I believe that neither in public nor in private life is much to be gained by violence of language. The next condition which I would lay down is that the language of the new Declaration should be as simple and as easily intelligible as possible. It should be of a kind which, if I may so put it, can be understood in every cottage throughout the length and breadth of the country. Such a formula His Majesty's Government have, I think, been fortunate in discovering. If I may be allowed to do so, I should like to offer them my congratulations upon their courage in putting on one side the formula upon which they were inclined to rely at first, and substituting for it the much
<col>622</col>
better formula which is now to be found in the Schedule of the Bill. I can conceive a more elaborate and 'I might almost say a more theologically scientific formula, and I have seen formulas of such a kind, but I doubt extremely whether any amount of additional ingenuity would add to the strength of the words which have been adopted in this Bill.<lb/>
In the new Declaration His Majesty declares himself to be a faithful Protestant; and recognising the true intent of the enactments to secure the Protestant Succession to the Throne of his realm engages to uphold and maintain such enactments to the best of his power. These enactments are, no doubt, the four enactments cited in the White Paper which may therefore be said to be embodied in the terms of the Declaration. These are plain words, wholly free from circumlocution, quite unlikely to occasion any offence to any one, and in my belief amply sufficient for the purpose for which they are intended. I trust I am not wrong in believing that this proposal of His Majesty's Government is likely to receive a favourable reception in this House. When I look, as I have looked, at the speeches which have been delivered by Roman Catholic Peers, by my noble friend the noble Duke behind me and others, on former occasions, I cannot find in this Declaration anything which so far as I can make out they are likely to take exception to. The views of the Church of England have been expressed this evening with the utmost clearness by the most rev. Primate, and if he is content with the Declaration as he finds it in this Bill, it is certainly not for me to complain of it as insufficient. The Nonconformist subjects of the Crown will, I should think, be grateful for the prominence given to the announcement that His Majesty is a faithful Protestant, and I venture to hope that in Scotland, where this question has been regarded somewhat critically, the fact that the Act of Union remains untouched, and is, I suppose, intended to be referred to in the Declaration should be enough to allay any misgivings felt in that quarter. The words of the Declaration seem to me therefore, upon the whole, to be wise, and well chosen, and fit to take their place and hold their place on the Statute-book.<lb/>
I will only say one word more before I sit down rather with reference to what
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0316"/>
<col>623</col>
was said earlier in the evening by my noble friend Lord Kinnaird when he made his Motion. I agree with the noble Earl opposite that there is nothing to be gained by postponing the further stages of this discussion. It is true the Bill will be passed rapidly through your Lordships' House. But the subject, as we all know, is not a new one. It has been voluminously discussed out of doors, and I do not think the course which His Majesty's Government intend to take is really open to the charge of an attempt to stifle discussion. I do not know of any new facts that can be brought to our attention. I doubt whether much more is possible in what I may describe as the exegesis of the matter. What we certainly should have, if the further consideration of this Bill were to be postponed, would be the prolongation of a rather acute and bitter controversy which I honestly believe would not be for the advantage of the country or of those taking part in it.<lb/>
If I could trust myself to prophesy I should anticipate that 'before many months are passed the public outside will have very much forgotten the details of this discussion. I doubt whether there is any one, whatever his particular religious tenets may be, who will sleep less peaceably in his bed because this Bill has passed. I believe on the contrary that the public mind will settle down under this new Declaration just as it settled down under the old Declaration during the long years of the late Queen's reign; and that more and more people will realise that the Protestant. Succession in this country rests upon foundations laid much deeper than anything which the ingenuity of either theologians or lawyers is able to contrive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01850"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to take up your Lordships' time by again going over any of the details of this question. It is perfectly true that at the end of this part of the session the matter has to be dealt with at great speed. As has been pointed out by more than one noble Lord who has spoken to-night, the whole question has been widely discussed for years, and no one can pretend that it has not been fully considered. But as one of those who have so often felt obliged to call your Lordships' attention to the terms of the old Declaration, I cannot allow
<col>624</col>
the debate to pass without expressing in my own name, and, if they will allow me to do so, in the name of others who hold the same Faith, our deep appreciation of the way in which the matter has been dealt with. We have felt it our duty from time to time to bring the question forward strongly and ardently, yet, I think, moderately. I assure your Lordships that it has been one of extreme difficulty to deal with, and if at times we have felt regret that greater speed was not adopted in dealing with it, we never lost sight of the fact that it was a very thorny subject. I wish now to express my thanks to the Prime Minister and the Government, to the leaders on both sides of the House, and the most rev. Primate and all concerned, for the very generous treatment the matter has received.<lb/>
No one, I venture to think, need have any fear that the Protestant Succession will be endangered by the change which has been made in the Declaration. As has been said, it is the wish of the people of this country that the Succession to the Throne should be Protestant. At the same time it seems to me that the more you attempt to bolster up the Protestant Succession with such a form of Declaration as the past one the more you endanger rather than make safe the continuance of that which you desire. As one who holds the Faith I do, I rejoice that this which was so deeply offensive to the most cherished religious convictions of Roman Catholics has been withdrawn; and I think that all the subjects of the British Crown will rejoice also that the King at the very commencement of his reign will not have to perform an act which must have been deeply distasteful to His Majesty and which he knew would be deeply wounding to millions of his loyal subjects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01851"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I promise not to detain your Lordships more than a few moments, because a great deal of what I proposed to say has already been said by noble Lords far better than I could have said it. Still, I wish, as an Irish Roman Catholic, to say that I fully accept the principle of the Protestant Succession to the Throne of these Realms, and that I think this principle is very adequately safeguarded by the two great Acts to which attention has been called this evening. By one of these
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0317"/>
<col>625</col>
Acts, as stated in this White Paper, the King, if lie becomes reconciled to the Church of Rome or marries a Roman Catholic, ceases to be Sovereign, while his subjects are released from their obedience to him; and in the Act of Settlement it is laid down that the Sovereign shall join in communion with the Church of England as by law established. It seems to me, my Lords, that these three provisions do most effectively safeguard the Protestant Succession to the Throne.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Kinnaird, stated that the Declaration was necessary because a dispensing power rested with the Pope, so that a Sovereign could take an oath and yet be released from the consequences thereof. I believe that I am as well-instructed a Roman. Catholic as most nowadays, but the noble Lord's statement struck me with amazement. I never heard of such a proposition before, and personally I entirely repudiate and reject it. In regard to the Declaration, your Lordships have been told the circumstances under which it came into existence. It is true, as the most rev. Primate has said, that for many years before the Declaration appeared on the Statute-book there was a great deal of diplomacy going on between the French King and Charles II. But, my Lords, that was the custom of the time on both sides, and Charles II was, as we all know, to a considerable extent forced into these evil ways by the Parliamentary opposition very largely engineered by Shaftesbury. The immediate origin of the Declaration was the perjuries of the impostor Titus Oates acting on the delusion of the nation. Taking advantage of the opportunity Shaftesbury forced this Declaration. through Parliament, his object being to exclude Roman Catholics from the public service and from Parliament. It was effective, and 150 years elapsed before the Roman Catholic members of your Lordships' House and of the other House were able again to take part in public affairs in this country. It has taken eighty years more to relieve the King of the necessity of making this Declaration. So far as Irishmen are concerned, we look upon the removal of the Declaration as a message of peace, and we have no objection whatever to the Declaration which it is proposed to substitute for it. And at the same time we feel most thankful to your Lordships' House and to the other House of Parlia-
<col>626</col>
ment for the action they have taken in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01852"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise as a humble member of your Lordships' House to express my sincere gratitude to His Majesty's Government for having brought before Parliament proposals for getting rid of a Declaration which was, in my opinion, a blot on the Statute-book, and which was the result of one of the most disgraceful episodes in English history. On that point I should like, if I may, for one moment to supplement what has fallen from the most rev. Primate with regard to the Treaty of Dover. He did not give a complete account of what was the real object of that Treaty. Its object was only incidentally concerned with religion. The real object was to enable Charles II to obtain such an amount of subsidies from Louis XIV as to make it possible for him to govern without the consent of his subjects in England. That is why it was taken up so violently by the Liberals of that time, and Titus Oates and the Popish Plot was a pretext and not by any means the real reason for the agitation at that time. I may be mistaken, but to imply that the Declaration arose out of religious intrigues which had their origin some years before the Popish Plot is, it seems to me, to give not altogether a complete account of those transactions.<lb/>
My Lords, the Declaration which I hope will very soon be got rid of has not only been a distress to all reasonable people, but was absolutely unnecessary. The Prime Minister in the admirable speech he made the other day in another place, proved to demonstration that if it is desired to exclude a Roman Catholic from the Throne there is ample security under the Act of Settlement and by other legal provisions to secure that object, and that, in fact, the Declaration adds nothing to that security, since there is no penalty attaching to the King if he declines to make it. There can be no object, therefore, in maintaining a Declaration which is abhorrent not only to Roman Catholics but to a great many of His Majesty's subjects, which is an offence, against charity, and which, from whatever point of view it is approached, is theologically absurd and indefensible.<lb/>
The only complaint, therefore, I have to make on the subject is that the Govern-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0318"/>
<col>627</col>
ment in dealing with the matter did not take the sensible and consistent course, and what was the logical conclusion of the Prime Minister's speech&#x2014;namely, to get rid of the Declaration altogether. This was the only reasonable course, as indeed Mr. Asquith as much as said himself, and it would also have been, I think, the easiest. The Government's original proposal by the words "as by law established" committed the King to a declaration of membership in the Church of England, yet in doing this it made use in another part of the suggested Declaration of words unknown to any distinctive formulary of the Church of England&#x2014;words not found, as the Prime Minister admitted, either in the Prayer-book or in the Articles, and which were open to grave misconception. A Church is to be described by what it believes, not by what it denies. So far then I am glad that this first form has been withdrawn. In the Declaration as it now stands all reference to the Church of England has been omitted, and the King has only to declare himself "a faithful Protestant." I venture to think that the same objection, only in a different shape, might be made to the new form as applied to the one for which it has been substituted.<lb/>
The old historical antithesis was between Protestant and Papist. The antithesis has now come to be in popular estimation between Protestant and Catholic. In the former and historical sense of the words the Orthodox Churches of the East, such as the Church of Russia, the Church of Constantinople, were as much Protestant as the Established Church in Scotland, or any of the numerous Nonconformist sects in England. Archbishop Laud, the type of all that was odious in the eyes of Puritans and modern Protestants, declared himself a Protestant; and in that sense all those who deny the universal coercive jurisdiction and the temporal claim of Rome are Protestants. I would not object to the word in that sense myself. But the modern and popular acceptation of the word "Protestant," as the word is employed in the suggested Declaration, is not only misleading, but involves a statement contradictory of and absolutely irreconcilable with other statements the King has to make.<lb/>
The King every time lie receives Communion has to recite the Creed in which he
<col>628</col>
professes his belief in the Holy Catholic Church. On Easter Day, Whitsun Day, Christmas Day, Ascension Day, and many saint days he has to declare that the Catholic faith is necessary for salvation, and at his Coronation he promises, among other things, to "defend the Catholic faith." How are these statements and obligations to be reconciled with the meaning popularly attached to the word Protestant? Is it not obvious that obligations which have to be glossed on one side or the other to bring them into harmony are misleading and useless? If you wish to impose a declaration of personal belief on the King, you should have substituted for the existing Declaration such a declaration of assent to the Prayer-book and Articles of the Church of England as up to some fifty years ago was required of all persons matriculating or taking a degree at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and if you did not choose to do this, then the only reasonable and consistent alternative was to abolish the Declaration altogether.<lb/>
My Lords, no one can resent more than I do the intrusion of spiritual authority into matters outside its domain. When, as sometimes happens abroad, people are told that they cannot be good Catholics if they do not support the policy of the Pope and of the Roman Curia, and when the attempt is made to coerce clergy and laity alike in regard to matters which do not directly concern the Faith, I think it as deplorable as the attempt made in England to identify Church principles and loyalty to the Church of England with Conservatism in politics. All these things should he kept separate. We do not want the intrusion of spiritual authority in temporal affairs any more than we want the intrusion of temporal authority into what are spiritual matters. What we do want is complete freedom of conscience in all these matters, and I am compelled to say that I am at a loss to see why, if liberty of conscience and freedom from tests are good things, they are not as good for the King as for the humblest of his subjects. No one has mentioned this point, I notice, except the Rev. C. Silvester Horne in the House of Commons in the admirable speech which be made in regard. to the Declaration.<lb/>
The Government have of late been insisting on freedom from all tests in the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0319"/>
<col>629</col>
case of those entrusted with the education and the religious instruction of the children in all State schools. I should have thought the religion of the country more in danger of being affected by such a provision, under which Roman Catholics might be teaching Protestant children, than by the omission of the Declaration on the part of the King, who after all only acts on the advice of his Ministers. In all these things are we not too superstitious? Can there be a greater absurdity, as things are, than to tie the King and leave the Prime Minister free? Which, if he were so minded, could do more to bring us under what is called the dominion of Rome&#x2014;the King or a Prime Minister such as, say, Mr. Gladstone or the late Lord Salisbury? Of course the reason why the Government have not proposed the total abolition of the Declaration, as Mr. Asquith not obscurely intimated he would have preferred to do himself, is that they were afraid of a Protestant clamour. A little courage would be good in such things, and it would have required so little courage in this case. After all, leaders are there to lead, and those who are responsible for such agitation as there is with regard to the Declaration are really people of no importance and precisely the same kind of people as those who in their time moved heaven and earth to prevent Roman Catholic emancipation. Roman Catholic emancipation was carried; no one was one penny the worse, and when this Declaration had been got rid of in six months time everything about it would have been forgotten, except the wonder that any one should ever have thought that the safety of the country and the security of religion depended on the maintenance of such a Declaration.</membercontribution></p>

They have done it in two directions&#x2014;first, by removing from the old Declaration language which was necessarily offensive to Roman Catholics, and which, I feel sure, grated on all tolerant minds nowadays; and, in the second place, by going further and removing all repudiatory references to specific Christian doctrines held sacred by many of the subjects of the Crown. It was extremely unpleasant and unbecoming that those doctrines should, have been referred to in the manner in which they were by the Sovereign, especially on such an occasion as his-Coronation, when he was asking for the loyalty and support of all his subjects. throughout the Empire, twelve millions of whom are Roman Catholics.<lb/>
Perhaps the most pleasing circumstance in connection with the whole of this matter to Irish Catholics has been the kindly support and sympathy shown towards them by a large body of their Protestant fellow-countrymen. The noble Earl the Leader of the House read this afternoon a resolution passed at a meeting of Irish Protestants in Dublin, and I shall not therefore read it, as I intended to. But may I just refer to it in order to show the support it received in a few days? The meeting was presided over by the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, and the petition based on the resolution was signed by the Hon. and Rev. B. J. Plunket, a son of a Protestant. Archbishop of Dublin, and by about 300 of the clergymen of the Protestant Church in Ireland; by a large number of Irish Protestants, by representative men including Judges and Professors of Dublin University, and by many members of your Lordships' House, my noble friends Lord Clonbrock, Lord Meath, and Lord Barrymore, who are representative of the Protestants in Ireland. I wish especially, as an Irish Catholic, to refer to these facts, which I am sure all will consider most gratifying. But although this change is going happily to be carried out I fail to see how it can in any way endanger the Protestant Succession or the fealty of the reigning Sovereign to the Protestant Faith. Those are two matters which no Catholic has questioned the right of Parliament to safeguard; and I venture to say, as has been already pointed out by the noble Duke,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0320"/>
<col>631</col>
that it is really very far-fetched, uncanny and impossible, to imagine any Roman Catholic taking the Declaration in its new form; and, of course, there are the other safeguards provided by the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement.<lb/>
It has been said on some occasions that, in spite of the language in the old Declaration being offensive and the references to Christian doctrines unbecoming, it did no harm to Roman Catholics. I differ from that. It was a very strange and unsympathetic view to take. Every time the old Declaration was repeated or referred to it was, I believe, the cause of a great deal of serious ill-feeling and misunderstanding, even between the Throne and the Roman Catholic subjects of the Sovereign and certainly between Roman Catholics and their Protestant fellow-countrymen. For those reasons I cannot agree that it did no harm. I rejoice, therefore, to see it amended in the form proposed, and I desire to again join in congratulating the Government and those who supported them in Parliment and in the country generally upon their courageous action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01854"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not strike any discordant note in the discussion in which I am sure many of us have been interested this afternoon, and I shall certainly not at this time trespass at any length upon the attention of your Lordships. But I desire to say a few words solely and simply on the ground that were I to remain absolutely silent perhaps my silence might be misconstrued. Like others of your Lordships, I was responsible for the efforts which were made to settle this question some ten years ago on the part of Lord Salisbury's Government. I regret that those efforts availed little, but I rejoice that a happier set of circumstances has arisen which has enabled the Government, after due consideration and deliberation, to suggest a change from the existing form of Declaration.<lb/>
My reason for desiring the change is not that I wish to interfere with the certainty of the Protestant Succession to the Throne. I desire to see a change made because I think the existing form of Declaration is unfair to the Protestant Churches of the country. It seems to me that the form of words put into the mouth of the Sovereign is foreign to Christian ideals and principles, and so is likely to do harm rather than good
<col>632</col>
to the very cause it is intended to support. It is nothing to me that it is alleged that the Roman Catholic Church exacts tests in language worse, perhaps, than that which is now being removed. That is not material to the point at issue for your Lordships. The point at issue is whether the present form of Declaration is necessary to secure the Protestant Succession, and is in itself in conformity with Christian ideals and principles. The most rev. Primate has shown conclusively that what underlies the necessity for some Declaration are not ecclesiastical reasons, but political reasons. In this country we are resolved, after severe lessons in history, that it is not safe for us to have a Roman Catholic Sovereign. We are resolved that the Sovereign of these realms shall owe no allegiance but to his God, his country, and to himself, and we are resolved that there shall be no outside authority or jurisdiction to interfere with the performance of the great task which Providence has committed to his care.<lb/>
It may be that there is sufficient security for what we want without any Declaration at all. So far as I am concerned, I would be inclined to associate myself with those who say that the Declaration is superfluous; but I do not believe that it would have been possible for the Government, without running counter to the feelings and wishes of a great many of the people of this country, to have dispensed with the Declaration altogether. As the noble Earl who moved the Second Reading of the Bill told your Lordships, there were the proverbial three courses open to the Government&#x2014;either to maintain the Declaration as it stood, to have some modified form of negative Declaration abjuring certain tenets of the Roman Catholic Church, or to take the course which they have taken of trying to find some new affirmative Declaration making the actual position of the Sovereign as plain as it is possible to make it. As the noble Earl truly said, each one of these courses had its difficulties and its advantages. What we all wanted was to get the most absolute and complete security which is possible for the maintenance of the Protestant Succession, without using language calculated to give offence to our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects. It has been gratifying to see from the tenor of the debate to-night that, at any rate so far as we can judge, by the form of words now proposed that difficult task is
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0321"/>
<col>633</col>
in a fair way of being successfully accomplished.<lb/>
The Government have not told us&#x2014;and perhaps it is not reasonable to ask them&#x2014;why it was that they chose the particular form of words which appeared in the Bill as originally presented to Parliament. Anxious as I have always been to find a solution of this difficulty, I venture to say that of all the courses open to the Government the course which they chose in the first Declaration proposed by them was perhaps the very worst which they could possibly have chosen. So far as I am personally concerned I read it with absolute and profound amazement. I could not understand how fifteen or twenty gentlemen of, if they will let me say so, much more than average intelligence could possibly by their conjoint efforts have produced anything so utterly had for the purpose which they had in view. It pleased nobody at all. It was condemned by the most rev. Primate; it certainly gave the greatest possible amount of offence to the Nonconformist body in England; and I can assure them that if ever the possibility of altering the present Declaration was in doubt, it was the form of words which the Government chose so far as Scotland was concerned which made their task a difficult one.<lb/>
I speak on this matter with some knowledge, because before the actual form of words which were to be substituted was made known, but while it was perfectly well-known that the Government intended to deal with the subject, I as a member of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland endeavoured to get that body to petition in favour of some change. I was not successful. There was a division of opinion; the majority thought that it was a matter which it did not concern the Supreme Court of the Church of Scotland as a Court to interfere with at all; and so far as the General Assembly was concerned it resolved to take no action. But, my Lords, when the particular form of words chosen by the Government was made known, the whole situation in Scotland was changed; and, if they will ask their Scottish supporters, I venture to say they will find that utterly regardless of Party, of class, almost of religious opinion, with one common consent the form of words chosen by the Government was disapproved
<col>634</col>
of. Almost spontaneously about nine-tenths of the parishes in Scotland sent up petitions against the form of words chosen. For the first time in history it was made known in Scotland that it was proposed to bind the Sovereign of the United Kingdom by Statute to be a member of the Church of England. We have always known that he was to join in communion with the Church of England, and I think it is probable that as far as we can see in the future the Sovereign is likely to be really in fact a. member of the Church of England. That does not seem to us unnatural; it seems to us, as England is the predominant partner of this Empire, to be not an unreasonable thing; but when we were asked to say by Statute that the Sovereign is to be a member of a particular Church, that Church being for one division of the country and having no right of interference north of the Tweed, the whole situation was changed. I venture to say that if that form of words had been persevered with there is hardly one of us north of the Tweed who would have rested until we had accomplished the task of getting that form of words repealed. That is now past and gone, and it does not interfere with the desire of the great majority of the people of Scotland to see the offensive words in the present Declaration removed; and I believe, as many noble Lords have said in this debate to-night, that after a few months, certainly after a very few years, have passed we shall almost all of us have forgotten that there ever was this controversy at all. I am not afraid of the change. I am not intolerant, I hope, towards those who disagree with the views which I myself hold. But what we are resolved, and what I believe this Declaration will secure, is that the Sovereign of this country shall be the master in his own dominion, without the possibility of interference by any authority, however great, which is outside the bounds of the territory over which he rules.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01858"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OR AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to ask the House to give a Second Reading to this small Bill, upon which it will only be necessary for me to say a very few words. Your Lordships will remember that the Land Tenure Bill of 1906 applied to Scotland. It was somewhat difficult for an individual who did riot have the good fortune to be a Scotsman either by birth or by accident to frame a Bill which would be acceptable to Scotland, but I am glad to say that with one small exception the Government were successful. This is a small Bill of only two sections, the first of which runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Notwithstanding anything in section eleven of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1908, contained, that section shall not apply to valuations of sheep stocks, dung, fallow, Straw, crops, fences, and other specific things the property of an outgoing tenant."</quote>
When the Bill of 1908 was before your Lordships the noble Earl, Lord Camper-down, objected to the Bill applying to valuations. I was advised on the highest legal authority that arbitrations and valuations were distinct. That was a point on which I could not possibly give an opinion myself. We all know that justice is blind, and I suppose justice is sometimes mistaken, because subsequent litigation has shown that Scottish leases are so worded as to turn what would ordinarily be valuations into arbitrations. I do not know if your Lordships quite understand that; it is rather involved, but that is what the highest legal authorities have decided. In consequence of that decision I bring in this little Bill, which I very respectfully ask your Lordships to be good enough to read a second time so as to put things perfectly straight and in order to meet the wishes of the Scottish members of both Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Carrington</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01859"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPEEDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of offering any opposition to this Bill, because it has become absolutely necessary. But I was, I confess, considerably surprised to hear the noble Earl opposite describe it as a "little Bill." Is he aware that this Bill absolutely contradicts and contravenes the main principle on which his old Agricultural Bill for Scotland was founded in
<col>636</col>
1906? First of all, with regard to what has happened, the noble Earl has just said that I objected to the Bill, now the Act, on the ground that, in my opinion, valuation was not properly treated. What I objected to was this. I said that here you were for the first time attempting to establish one agricultural law for England, a country under yearly tenancy, and Scotland, which is under nineteen years leases, and I submitted that it stood to reason&#x2014;in fact, any child who knew anything about Scottish agriculture could have told the noble Earl&#x2014;that there must be certain points in which the legislation for the two countries would have to be different. I ventured to say on that occasion, "Here you are using the word 'arbitration,' which is, perhaps, one of the most dangerous words connected with Scottish agriculture, and you are applying this Bill drawn for England with this word in it to Scotland. You little know what you are undertaking"; and I went on to say to the noble Earl, "If you do not take care I believe it is quite possible you will upset the whole system of sheep valuations in Scotland." Sheep valuations in Scotland, as I daresay the noble Earl is now aware, constitute a considerable element in the agricultural industry of that country. The noble Earl very sensibly accepted my words and they went down to the House of Commons.<lb/>
In the other House the Bill was encountered by the present Attorney-General, Sir William Robson, who was then Solicitor-General. He said that the words I had suggested were really unnecessary and perfectly useless. Of course, noble Lords in this House know nothing about business, or Scotland, or anything else. And so he struck out the words. When the Bill returned to this House I took the liberty of saving to the noble Earl that it was not for me to raise any dispute&#x2014;I did not care about my words&#x2014;but I thought that within a very short period he would discover that a mistake had been made in striking them out. I did not attach any importance to the words merely because I happened to have suggested them, but those words, as the noble Earl, I am sure, will bear me out, would have prevented the difficulty that has since arisen. In a few weeks after the passing of the Act the sheep farmers came down upon us under an apprehension that their sheep contracts might be interfered with.
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0323"/>
<col>637</col>
Then, later, a landlord in Perthshire, a very excellent fellow but rather inclined to go to law, disputed the conditions in his lease. He said, "The Act of the noble Earl clearly does away with my lease," and so he went to law and the case has gone through every Court. All the Scottish Courts have said that the Act did away with the conditions of his lease, and that was affirmed here on the highest authority, and this Bill has become necessary to put the mutter right.<lb/>
What were the main principles of the noble Earl's measure which are contravened by this Bill which he calls a small Bill? The first was that the Act which is now the law for England, and, with this exception, for Scotland, did away as far as possible with custom and with contracts, and substituted therefor agricultural regulations made by Parliament. This is neither the place nor the time to enlarge on the extraordinary folly of that proceeding. I am sure that every noble Lord who knows anything about agriculture knows how unwise such a proceeding as that was. That was the first thing. It. did away with custom as far as it could and with agreements, and substituted Parliamentary regulations. The next thing was that it broke all existing contracts. That is one of the favourite courses pursued by His Majesty's Government with regard to these matters. The third was that you said that for the future there should be one law for England and for Scotland. The result has been that you are now obliged to bring in a Bill which reverses every single one of those three procedures. You are obliged to confess that for the future as to this matter of valuation there is to be one mode of valuation for Scotland and a different mode of valuation for England. In the second place, you abrogated existing contracts, and now you are obliged to restore all those leases and also to say that for the future existing leases may provide the way in which these valuations are to be conducted in Scotland. In the third place, you have restored custom and liberty of contract. My Lords, this is what my noble friend calls a small Bill&#x0021;<lb/>
I am quite sure of this, that if in breaking existing leases any landowner had been injured he might have cried for redress for as long as he liked and not one bit of redress would he have got. But you dare not behave in this way to tenant farmers,
<col>638</col>
and you are obliged to bring in this Bill for the purpose of restoring to the tenant farmers that which you were so unwise as to take away from them. The noble Earl told us that he was advised on the highest authority. I can only say that as that case went from Court to Court the noble Earl kept assuring the people that by the decision of the next Court it would be all right. Not only that, but the Lord Advocate gave the same assurance only a short time before the case came to this House. I do not know what the Lord Advocate thinks now, but he conducted the case himself when it came to the House of Lords. I was told&#x2014;I have not the least notion. whether it is true or not&#x2014;that he even went so far as to conduct the case without any fee. What is the result? If your Lordships look at the Bill you will see that the valuations are all enumerated&#x2014;sheep stocks, dung, fallow, straw, crops, fences, and so on. I am not sure if that is a very safe way of enumerating valuations, because as you were not right the last time it may possibly follow that you have omitted something again.<lb/>
The last point is, Who is to pay for all this vast legal amusement? The Scottish farmers put in a very strong claim indeed upon His Majesty's Government. They say, "We have been put to all the expense of going from Court to Court in order to prove your mistake. You have been assuring us that the law would be found to be one way, and we, at our own expense, have been obliged to prove that it is the other way. Are you going to pay us our costs?" If this had occurred in England we know the way my noble friend would have dealt with it. Your Lordships will remember that when a farmer in England had his land taken away from him for small holdings and the law did not give him any compensation, my noble friend said, "Here is a&#x00A3;50 note out of my own pocket; do not let us talk any more about it." That may do very well in England and when the amount is moderate, but&#x00A3;50 would not cover the costs in this case. A great many fifty pounds have been expended in the various Courts of Law, and the question is, Who is going to find this money? I suppose it will come out of some Scottish fund&#x2014;the Congested Districts Board or some fund of the kind, and in this House we shall never hear any more about it. It will be one of those little jiggery-pokery transactions behind

the scenes which we know Governments sometimes indulge in, and are not very proud of in public. That is all I have to say about this Bill. I only wish to rescue the noble Earl from the consequences of his own actions, and to say once inure that in the three respects I have mentioned this Bill contravenes the whole principle of his Act of 1906.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl did not condescend to argue the Amendment on its merits, and no reason was given us for the claim of privilege, in spite of every effort made to extract the reason from him both on that occasion and when I ventured to allude again to the subject on the Third Reading of the Bill.<lb/>
In these days, I think, nothing should be so jealously watched as claims of privilege. It seems to me that they are liable to be extended beyond anything we have been accustomed to, and sometimes in a most irresponsible and unusual manner. I think we ought to be very careful ourselves not to invade the privileges of another place. There is nothing which I personally desire to be so careful about. But I think we should be at least equally careful that new precedents are not made against us in these tunes and that an extension of privilege is not asked for beyond what is in accordance with precedent. When I challenged the noble Earl on the Third Reading of the Bill he would not give me any answer, but made a good-humoured allusion to what he described as a Homeric contest.<lb/>
I felt that the matter was of sufficient importance to be followed up, and I therefore took measures to ascertain whether it was likely that any question of privilege would be raised and I received a reply from the highest authority available that it was not considered that there was any privilege in the Amendment at all. I felt that if the claim made had been given effect to in another place it would have required great care in this House because it would have been, in my humble opinion, a distinct extension of the claim of privilege beyond anything to which we have been accustomed; and we should have found ourselves in the position, if we had even rejected the Amendment on its merits, of having made a precedent against this House.<lb/>
There may be a great deal to be said against the Amendment on its merits.<lb/>
<col>644</col>
Into that I do not enter. But it does seem to me that questions of privilege should not be raised in this rash and ill-considered way; and I have given the noble Earl private notice of my intention to raise the question and to ask him if he will now tell us on whose authority and initiative the claim of privilege was made on this Amendment. I am confident it was not the noble Earl's own idea, because on the Second Reading of the Bill he actually invited us in so many words to make the very Amendment which we made in Committee. I will quote his words&#x2014;
<quote>"There is a proviso in Clause 2 that no compensation shall be payable if the claim for compensation is not made before September 1, 1910. To-day is July 14. That would leave only six weeks, and the Bill is not through yet. Therefore I think your Lordships will Probably be of opinion that the time given is rather short, and I shall be prepared&#x2014;and I think it would be only right to do so, as we want to act perfectly fairly and justly to agriculturists&#x2014;to give a longer time than that now stated in the Bill." [6 H.L. Deb.,5 s., col. 190.]</quote>
On that invitation a noble Earl on the Opposition side of the House put down an Amendment to extend the period by two months, and we were met then, not by any argument whatever, but by the simple statement that the Amendment was a breach of privilege. I think it is fair to ask who started the idea; whether it was upon the authority of the noble Earl's private secretary or of some under-strapper in the Department of Agriculture. It is quite clear that it was not done on the noble Earl's initiative, or he never would have made the suggestion on Second Reading. These are serious things. I desire to treat the other House with the utmost respect; but, at the same time, I do think your Lordships ought to maintain a guardianship over this matter and see that privilege is not extended against you.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01893"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I have no reason to complain of the noble Lord's action in bringing forward this question. He has quoted from the Official Report what I said in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, and by those words, of course, I am prepared to stand. The best of us make mistakes sometimes, and when on the spur of the moment I made the statement as to the shortness of the notice it did not occur to me that this Bill had been an agreed Bill between both sides of the House
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0327"/>
<col>645</col>
of Commons. I think on reflection&#x2014;and I suppose every one is entitled to reflect&#x2014;that if your Lordships would assent to the suggestion it would be a pity to disturb the agreement which had been come to on both sides of the House, especially as the matter is not only retrospective but exceptional.<lb/>
There will be no hardship on farmers in fixing the date as September 1, because as soon as the Bill becomes law the Board of Agriculture will of course at once call the attention of all county councils to the Act. Though it is perfectly true that the claim must be made before September 1 in this year, yet the tenant-farmer who makes a claim will not be required to make a full and detailed claim by that date. He has only got to give notice of his intention to make a claim, and he will have a good long time after that date to make out his detailed claim. This question has been mooted over and over again in Parliament, and has been known to all county councils for months and to every party who may possibly be entitled to make a claim. Therefore I think on the merits there is a good case for asking your Lordships not to insist on the lengthened period.<lb/>
As to the question of breach of privilege, I was informed on the best authority that was at my disposal at the time that if the date was altered it would clearly be a question of privilege, and that that question would be raised in the Commons. How could I have acted otherwise than I did when I was told by a high authority&#x2014;not a private secretary?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01894"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: What authority?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01895"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I will come to that in a moment. If a Minister is told on high authority that a certain question will be considered a matter of privilege in the other House, surely he ought not to remain silent. It was only courteous and fair that I should inform your Lordships what I believed was likely to happen. I have been asked what was my authority. I think my answer had better be that it was very high authority indeed; I will not say the very highest, because I presume the highest authority in these matters is the House of Commons itself. I entirely accept the responsibility in this matter. If I have sinned I am very sorry for it. I hope your Lordships will accept my
<col>646</col>
explanation and not insist upon your Amendment, but allow the Bill, which will be a great boon and relief to a most deserving and hard-working set of people, to go through.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01896"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the House is indebted to my noble friend who is acting as Chairman of Committees for having called attention to this singular episode. The question of the conflict between the privilege of your Lordships' House and the privilege of the House of Commons is a very serious one. I have on more than one occasion felt it my duty to call attention to the matter, and I share my noble friend's feeling that we ought to be extremely careful how we allow any new encroachment&#x2014;there have been many old encroachments&#x2014;on the privileges of this House. I hope the noble Earl opposite will not take it amiss if I tell him that we on this side of the House are not quite so well satisfied with his explanation of the occurrence as he appears to be himself.<lb/>
The story is really a very singular and instructive one. In the first place, the noble Earl with great effect criticised his own Bill and pointed out that it was open to serious objection at a particular point. Thereupon a noble friend of mine who is not here to-night, Lord Dunmore, taking the noble Earl at his word, moved an Amendment designed to carry out the very suggestion which the noble Earl himself had made, and that Amendment was supported and found favour with your Lordships. The noble Earl, however, objected to the Amendment, not upon its merits&#x2014;it was impossible for him to object to it upon its merits after his speech in moving the Second Reading of the Bill&#x2014;but upon the point of privilege. He told the House that he felt certain that the Amendment would be objected to elsewhere on the ground of privilege. I must be allowed to say that whatever the authority by which the noble Earl was inspired he was rather premature in raising the question of privilege at that stage and in this House; and for this reason, that even if an Amendment made by your Lordships should happen to be clearly an encroachment of the privilege of the House of Commons, it does not in the least follow that the House. of Commons need insist on its privilege; and if in this case a question of privilege had arisen elsewhere it might
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0328"/>
<col>647</col>
perfectly well have been pleaded that upon the merits, the Amendment being consonant with the suggestion of the noble Earl himself, the House of Commons ought not to insist upon its own extreme rights.<lb/>
Now the Amendment comes back to us, and the noble Earl asks us not to insist upon it, not on the question of privilege, but he goes back on the question of merits, and I must say I was anxious to see what kind of a case he could make out against the Amendment upon the merits. His defence was, as I understood him, that this was an agreed Bill. But, my Lords, what agreement can there be elsewhere that would preclude this House from putting in a legitimate Amendment, an Amendment suggested by the noble Earl himself, and obviously on the face of it wholly unexceptionable? I am told that even in the House of Commons the question of the date to be inserted in the Bill was strongly raised, and that a member of His Majesty's Government suggested in that House that owing to the delay which had taken place the grievance of the farmers might be met if the Bill were amended in this House. That was a suggestion which, as I understand, was actually made in the House of Commons by Sir E. Strachey, who represents there the Department over which the noble Earl presides. What will happen if we do not press this Amendment? The agriculturists, who have found in the noble Earl opposite so stalwart a champion, will have something like three weeks only left them to put in these claims. That is, according to the showing of the noble Earl himself, very short shrift indeed; and I must say I have heard nothing yet to satisfy me that after all that has taken place we should not be right in insisting upon the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Dunmore.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01897"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, might I ask the noble Earl in charge of this Bill a question with reference to a statement he made this evening? He said that the date of September 1 would give the tenant farmer plenty of time because all that was necessary under the Bill was that he should give notice by that date that he intended to claim. Would the noble Earl kindly point out to me where words are to be found in the Bill to that effect? I cannot find anything about it.</membercontribution></p>
<col>648</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01898"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should also like to put a question to the noble Earl. He said that it is his intention, if the Bill becomes law, to at once communicate with all the county councils in England so that the claims to be raised can be brought forward. The county council over which I have the honour to preside meets the day after to-morrow, but does not meet again until November. I should be obliged to the noble Earl if he would tell us how he is going to communicate in such a case as that, which is not an uncommon one, with the county councils. I suppose his answer will be that any letter sent from his Department to a county council would be referred to the small holdings committee or to some other committee. At any other time of the year that might be a fairly satisfactory answer, but I beg to remind the noble Earl that committees of county councils, like other people, go for a holiday occasionally, and August and September are months in which it is most difficult to get committees together or to get any business done in connection with county councils. I do not think there could have been a time of the year or an arrangement more thoroughly inconvenient. I wish the noble Earl would intimate, if possible, how these difficulties are to be got over.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01899"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word on this matter, because I took part in the discussion in Committee, when I sat next to my noble friend the Minister for Agriculture. I do not think that justice has been done to my noble friend. What took place was this. The noble Lord the Acting Chairman of Committees has said that he received an intimation from a high authority that this was not likely to be regarded as a matter of privilege in the House of Commons. Very well; but my noble friend Lord Carrington had received&#x2014;he showed it to me&#x2014;a communication in a different sense.</membercontribution></p>

Having received the information to which I have referred, my noble friend the President of the Board
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0329"/>
<col>649</col>
of Agriculture wished to avoid any action likely to result in a conflict on a matter which, after all, is not one of much importance. I do not think he expressed his own private opinion that it was a matter of privilege. Certainly when I supported him I did not do so. What I said was that I thought it a matter which was generally judged of by the House of Commons, and which was best left to that House. But I had reason for thinking that the question would be raised. The only motive the noble Earl had was a desire to prevent a conflict which no one wishes, and I am quite sure the House will do justice to the reasons which actuated my noble friend. There was no intention whatever on his part of infringing the rights and privileges of this House or of exaggerating those of the other, but simply to prevent a conflict.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01902"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been asked two questions on this thorny subject, one by Lord Camperdown as to the words in the Bill. I am not a judge of English; I am not a literary man, and must rather plead ignorance. I believe, however, that the word "claim" does not signify the detailed claim, which can be sent later.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01903"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Where are the words in the Bill which say that the detailed scheme can be sent in afterwards?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01904"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: That is the action the Board of Agriculture will take under the Act. Then as to the question put to me by the noble Duke opposite as to the county councils and small holdings committees going on holiday, there will, I suppose, be some one to attend to business. The clerk or some deputy clerk will be there, or, at any rate, there will be somebody on the premises, and there would not be very much difficulty, I presume, in that person, whoever he may be, sending a notice to the county papers, which are published every week, to inform the tenant farmers of what had happened, and to tell them that they should send in their claims before the end of the present month.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01905"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quite admit that I had no right to ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to give us the name of his correspondent who has proved to be an unreliable correspondent in this instance.<lb/>
<col>650</col>
For we have it on the authority of my noble friend who sits at the Table (Lord Balfour of Burleigh) that he knows from a very high authority indeed that this Amendment was not within the limits of a breach of privilege, and we have, beyond that, the authority of the House of Commons itself, which has, in fact, not raised the question of privilege. This practically decides that matter. I did not rise to prolong the discussion beyond saying that I do think it a matter of regret that those who are responsible for the honour and authority of this House should be the first to desire to diminish its privileges. I have been brought up to believe that those who have the great privilege and honour of leading this House should be the guardians of its privileges, and should be even more eager&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01906"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Marquess allow me to ask him&#x2014;Does he think that a Minister, when he has real reason for believing that there may be conflict between the two Houses raised by an Amendment, is not at liberty to tell the House that they had better decide not to pass that Amendment? Is that not acting loyally to the House of which he is a member?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01907"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I have not seen the terms of this mysterious communication to which the noble and learned Lord has alluded. Of course, if that communication came from the highest authority in the House of Commons and if it was an explicit statement that the Amendment would be regarded as a breach of privilege, no doubt the Minister would be justified in so informing this House. But if it is anything short of that I should hope that, at any rate in the future&#x2014;I put it no higher than that&#x2014;noble Lords who lead this House will be a little more anxious to defend its privileges.<lb/>
I rose, however, not to prolong this discussion, but to respectfully ask the noble Earl who leads the House whether he will give us a reply upon the merits of this Amendment. The matter of privilege has now been settled, but there are the merits of the Amendment itself. Let me recall what the state of the case is on the merits. On July 14 the noble Earl who is responsible for this Bill made a statement in this House in which he said that the time which lay between that date
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0330"/>
<col>651</col>
and September I was too short if we were to treat agricultural interests fairly. Does he think that the cogency of that argument has been diminished by the fact that we are now speaking on August 2? Does he think, if it was too short a time when it was six weeks, that it is quite sufficient time when it is very little more than three weeks? I mean, what position do the noble Earl and his Department and His Majesty's Government take up on this Amendment? Why should we not insist upon it? It is not a breach of privilege, we know. It is the proposal of His Majesty's Government both in this House and in the other House. There may be a reason, but what possible reason can there be for not accepting the Amendment? The noble Earl says there was an agreement. Between whom was it made? We cannot have all these mysteries. Where is the alleged agreement? Is it between noble Lords on that side of the House and noble Lords on this side?</membercontribution></p>

All we know is that by the consent of the Government itself
<col>652</col>
this Amendment is urgently called for, and unless we hear some good reason to the contrary what can we do except insist?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01914"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess has been good enough to address a personal appeal to me on this subject, although I do not, know' why I was singled out for the purpose. As far as this particular subject is concerned I occupy the position of the man in the street. I have only a hearsay knowledge of what passed. I am afraid I was not in the House when my noble friend made his original speech, and I am quite certain I was not in the House when the matter was considered in Committee. As your Lordships know, there have been circumstances which have caused me to be absent from my place somewhat oftener than I should have wished during the current session. Therefore when the noble Marquess asks me to defend the merits of the case I am afraid I must plead general ignorance of the subject, only modified by what I have heard fall from noble Lords on both sides of the House.<lb/>
What I take to be the position is this. There was a feeling that the period of time given to the farmers for this particular purpose might not be long enough, but on consideration it appeared that the grievance, if grievance there was at all, was a very small one, and that, as a matter of fact, it was not easy to show that any farmer who desired to lodge this notice would not have, as a matter of fact, sufficient opportunity of doing so. That I take to be the argument that is used. Is that argument contravened? Is it maintained by noble Lords opposite that there would be any considerable section of people whose interests would be seriously damnified by retaining the earlier date? If not, I put it to the House whether it is worth while to enter into, I will not say a conflict because the matter is too small to justify the use of such a word, but into a difference of opinion with the House of Commons on a matter of this kind? I fully admit that it is entirely within your Lordships' right, if you desire to do so, to insist upon this Amendment. But in view of the fact that no substantial grievance is proved&#x2014;if there were I should be the first to say by all means insist upon it&#x2014;is it worth while? I do not put it higher than that.<lb/>
I have no desire to engage in the separate controversy which was raised in regard to the question of privilege. I have
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0331"/>
<col>653</col>
frequently stated&#x2014;and I do not know that I am in entire agreement with all my friends on this matter&#x2014;that my own opinion is that it is as a general rule inadvisable for Ministers in this House, to whichever Party they belong&#x2014;and I do not expect agreement from either side in saying so&#x2014;to call attention to what may be regarded. in another place as a breach of privilege if it is a doubtful case. There may be cases so obvious that it is the duty of anybody, Minister or not, to call attention to the fact; but in other respects I have always personally preferred, and I think I have been blamed for it, to leave the House of Commons to look after its own privileges, which it is thoroughly competent to do. Perhaps I might say a little more. I speak with caution. But I confess I shall he very glad if the day ever comes when the question of privilege between the two Houses, which has given rise to so many difficulties, and which has, perhaps, caused almost more friction between the two Houses than any other subject&#x2014;I am speaking, of course, not of the rejection of important Bills but of our daily work&#x2014;can be cleared up once for all. It is one which has given many of us in this House great anxiety from time to time, and I hope that it may not be beyond the resources of civilisation in time to arrive at some general agreement on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01915"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just sat down seemed to be surprised that we should have appealed to him to give us his opinion on the subject, and he spoke of himself as occupying the position of the man in the street. We are accustomed to look upon the noble Earl in a different light from that. We have always looked, and never in vain, for guidance in difficulties and for fair and honest dealing at the noble Earl's hands. I should like to put it to the noble Earl that the position we are in with regard to this Amendment&#x2014;I am not dealing with the question of privilege&#x2014;is an extraordinarily unsatisfactory one if we do not insist upon the Amendment. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill on July 14, said that the date of September 1 would only leave six weeks, and he added that the Bill was not through yet. The noble Earl went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Therefore I think your Lordships will probably be of opinion that the time given is rather short, and I shall be prepared&#x2014;and I think it would be
<col>654</col>
only right to do so as we want to act perfectly fairly and justly to agriculturists&#x2014;to give a longer time than that now stated in the Bill."</quote>
What is the reason for not carrying out that pledge? The noble Earl who has just spoken has given us no reason whatever. There is no statement that it will lead to inconvenience; no statement that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture was misled or made a mistake in the matter. We have the declaration from the President of the Board of Agriculture here and the representative of the Board in the other House that the extension now asked for, and which has been inserted in the Bill, is a satisfactory extension. If we are to act fairly and justly to agriculturists it seems to me that the answer which the noble Earl who leads the House gave us just now really makes it almost compulsory on your Lordships' House to adhere to the Amendment. What is the objection to doing so? Who is going to be injured? The noble Earl who leads the House told us that it has not been proved that a large section of people will be grievously injured if the Amendment is not insisted upon. But who is going to be hurt if the Amendment is put in? No human being can be injured if we retain this Amendment. The Bill is now a retrospective Bill. Even the notice to September 1 is a notice of retrospective claims for retrospective injury done to tenants. Therefore I think, on behalf of the agriculturists who are to be dealt with so fairly and justly by the noble Earl at the head of the Agricultural Department, we have a right to ask your Lordships to adhere to the Amendment and retain November as the date in accordance with what was practically the promise of the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01932">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I move this Amendment to meet the view of those who feel that the words in the Schedule are much too indefinite in form. I do not know whether your Lordships will suggest
<col>656</col>
any different wording, but this is a form which received a certain amount of support in another place, and it was thought that it would meet the case without being in any way offensive to Roman Catholics, as were the words complained of in the old Declaration. It is felt by many that the position of the King, having taken the Declaration in the form originally introduced by His Majesty's Government, would have been a safer one with reference to the security of the Protestant Succession than the present form. The use of the word "Protestant" is not as definite as a declaration that His Majesty is a member of the Church of England, because by saying that he would be assenting to the 39 Articles, to the Book of Common Prayer, and also, I believe, to the Homilies. The petitions, couched in moderate language, which have been presented show that there is much anxiety on the subject. The noble Earl, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill yesterday, referred to a petition he had received from Dublin signed by over 2,000 Protestants. I have received a petition which was signed in three days by over 3,000 persons in Dublin. I only mention that to show that the Protestants of Dublin are not entirely represented by those to whom the noble Earl referred yesterday. I have no wish to wound the feelings of those to whom the words in the old Declaration were offensive, but those words being removed it appears to me that there should be something further than the mere bare statement as printed in the Bill. Into the whole subject I will not enter, for it would take a long time, and I suppose noble Lords have made up their minds which way they will vote. In reference to what the noble Earl the Leader of the House said yesterday, I apologise to your Lordships for having, in making too much use of notes, unwittingly infringed a Standing Order. In doing so I was influenced by a desire to keep my remarks concise in their bearing on the matter under discussion. I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name.</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01934"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, trust that the House will not accept the Amendment of the noble Lord. I can assure him that I do the fullest justice to the reality of conviction and the earnestness with which he thinks it right to bring forward this Amendment, but I think it is not difficult to show that it would he undesirable to pass it. I think if it had occurred to the noble Lord during the reign of Queen Victoria, when probably not one person in a thousand knew of the Declaration which the next Sovereign would have to take, and certainly not one in 10,000 knew of its terms&#x2014;if it had occurred to the noble Lord at that time to suggest an Amendment of this kind removing the offensive words, it is possible that it might have been carried. But a great deal has happened since then. There have been the long discussions of 1901 and since, and everything goes to show that a Declaration couched in the form of the noble Lord's Amendment would be unacceptable for two reasons. In the first place, it would be unacceptable because we now know that Roman Catholics, without exception, would take the strongest possible objection to the mention of the particular sacred doctrines set out in the Amendment. I think I am not going beyond the mark in saying that all the Roman Catholics within the Empire, for whom noble Lords here are qualified to speak, would not regard the alteration of the Declaration in this form as in any sense a satisfaction of the grievance under which they labour.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01936"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That being so, it would seem hardly worth while to proceed at all on the lines suggested by the noble Lord. In the second place, we all of us feel, I think, that it is a slight to the Sovereign to make him declare, as a supplement to a solemn Declaration taken on a great occasion, that he is speaking without mental reservation. Consequently, both parts of the suggested Amendment seem to me, and will, I think, seem to your Lordships generally, to err&#x2014;one in the sense of not satisfying those whom it is desired to relieve, and the other in placing an unfair obligation upon the Sovereign who is making the Declaration.<lb/>
<col>658</col>
The noble -Lord alluded to the important resolution which I mentioned in the course of my remarks yesterday as coming from Dublin, and he has got, he says, a counter resolution or petition. The remarkable part of the resolution to which I alluded was not, in fact, that 2,000 people had signed it, but that they were 2,000 people of education, standing, and in some cases of great eminence. It was a remarkable list of names in every way. I am informed that the petition or resolution for which the noble Lord makes himself responsible was taken round and the signature of everybody over sixteen years of age who could be found and who was able to write and willing to put his name to it was accepted. In those circumstances it is not remarkable that 3,000 signatures were obtained. I have no doubt that in a little time a great many more could have been obtained on the same terms.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord spoke of the moderate language in which the various communications were couched. I can only say I have received a great many conununications couched in most immoderate language, and I dare say many of your Lordships have had the same experience. But I repeat once more that except in the case of certain people whom it is impossible to reconcile to any change, because they really like the existing terms on account of their being painful to Roman Catholics&#x2014;except in the case of those people, who, I hope, are not numerous, I believe that in the course of a very few months there will be a general agreement that the form of Declaration which we have proposed is satisfactory in itself because it does not give pain to a large number of His Majesty's subjects, and also because it quite adequately secures, if further security is needed, the Protestant Succession, as to which we are all agreed. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will not accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01937"><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment is not quite satisfied that the Protestant Succession is safe. I agree with him to a certain extent, and I must cross swords with the most rev. Primate, who said last night that he regarded the word Protestant as amply sufficient. The other day I came across this ruling by a Jesuit&#x2014;

one's conversion to the Faith&#x2026;A Catholic who, on being asked, denies he is a Catholic, does not necessarily deny the Faith."</quote>
I do not say that our King would deny his faith, but we have to guard against any danger of this kind in the future. A well-known Roman Catholic newspaper, referring to the Declaration in its old form, declared that it could not be denied that the Low Church section of the Anglican body and the Protestant masses generally had a great interest in demanding its retention, because in the form in which it then stood it could never be taken by a Roman Catholic. I support the first part of the Amendment; but I think the Amendment as it stands too long and complicated. I suggest that Lord Kinnaird should modify it so that it should run&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not believe in the doctrine of Transubstantiation, or in the invocation of the Virgin Mary, or of any other saint."</quote>
I think that would be quite sufficient.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01938"><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not intended to intrude in this discussion, but, as the noble Lord who has just spoken is a fellow countryman of mine and a Protestant, I should like to dissociate myself from the only other Irishman who has spoken on this subject. I had the honour of signing the petition to which the noble Earl the Leader of the House referred, and I did so with great pleasure. I feel that it is absolutely unnecessary for us to put into the mouth of the King, not only words which are offensive to 12,000,000 of his subjects, but also words which enter into the discussion of the most delicate and most sacred subjects which it is possible to discuss. I feel that it is enough for the Sovereign to say, "I am a faithful Protestant." We have the Statutes to which reference was made on the Second Reading of this Bill. Personally I would have preferred no Declaration at all, but if a Declaration is deemed necessary I think the words suggested by His Majesty's Government are sufficient. The noble Viscount who spoke yesterday (Lord Halifax) did not think that he could properly designate himself as a Protestant. I am a humble member of the Church of England and of Ireland, and I can say that I am a Protestant and I am proud of it. I am delighted that His Majesty's Government have had the courage to come forward and settle what really was a difficult problem. Having met large numbers of Roman Catholics, not only in my own
<col>660</col>
country but throughout the Empire. I can say that the old Declaration was a sore festering in their minds. Let us have peace. Let us try and see if we cannot unite all the subjects of His Majesty, especially the Roman Catholics and the Protestants. Where it is necessary let us stand up for our own particular Faith, but where that is not necessary let us try and see if we cannot create peace between Roman Catholics and Protestants. It is, therefore, as a loyal member of the Protestant Church that I thank His Majesty's Government for the steps they have taken in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01939"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope my noble friend will not press this Amendment. The Amendment seems to me to weaken the Declaration. When the Sovereign declares that he is a faithful Protestant and you then single out for repudiation two doctrines, the question might be raised about the attitude towards other doctrines which are not included in the Amendment. Therefore my firm conviction is that the Declaration as drafted in the Schedule of this Bill is stronger and gives greater guarantees for the Protestant Succession than if the words suggested in the Amendment were added. I have a further strong objection to Protestantism being supposed to consist in the negation or repudiation of doctrines held by others. The strength of Protestantism is not rooted in negation, but is rooted in the affirmation of certain doctrines which are common to all the Protestant Churches, and in which, by this Declaration, the King declares his belief. I would point out to my noble friend that the Board of Education give grants to institutions in which the very doctrines to which he refers in his Amendment are inculcated. That is the natural result of liberty of conscience and freedom of worship which exist throughout the Empire, and which I consider to be essential to the maintenance of the Empire. From my own experience I can say that when I occupied functions of great responsibility in India I carefully abstained, as did my predecessors&#x2014;and that course has been followed by my successors&#x2014;from using any words which might give umbrage to any section of His Majesty's subjects in that great Empire, and I certainly do not think, in those circumstances, that the words in the old Declaration can be maintained, asking the Sovereign to pledge
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0335"/>
<col>661</col>
himself in a way in which no official is asked to pledge himself either here or in His Majesty's Dominions. I sincerely trust, as Lord Balfour of Burleigh said yesterday, that taking into account the Christian ideals of Protestantism&#x2014;and to my mind the honour of Protestantism is at stake&#x2014;my noble friend will not press this Amendment, but will accept the form of Declaration proposed by His Majesty's Government, which gives the fullest guarantee for the Protestant Succession, and satisfaction to the Protestant feeling of the country which has been so clearly manifested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01940"><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to remind the House that the words which appear in this Amendment were the cause of the then proposed alteration in the Declaration being shipwrecked some years ago. It was then proposed that these words should be substituted for the Accession Declaration as it now stands, and it was for that very reason that the Bill was rejected. To drag in without any apparent reason two of the most sacred doctrines of the Catholic Church as held by 200,000,000 of the human race seems to me simply outrageous. It cannot be defended on any ground whatever, except that these were considered test doctrines at the time when the old Declaration was framed. With regard to the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Ashtown, I regret to say that I was not able to catch every word he said, but I understood him to quote from some Catholic theologian a passage which was very derogatory to the honour of Catholics generally. I should like to know whether that theologian was recognised or his works authorised in any way. I should imagine not. As to the Amendment now before the Committee, I earnestly hope that Lord Kinnaird will not press it to a Division. I do not think there would be any chance of your Lordships accepting his proposal, but I hope he will withdraw it. The matter has now been thoroughly discussed for years, and I am thankful to think that this is the last occasion on which it will ever be submitted for your Lordships' deliberation. I think we may now, without further discussion, remove the old form of Declaration from the Statute-book, and carry out its death and burial.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01946"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to consult the convenience of noble Lords opposite with regard to this Bill. We read the Bill a second time last night, and I think those noble Lords who were present on that occasion and read the special rules which were made by the Board of Trade in connection with the Labour Exchanges and which I had placed upon the Table of the House for the information of your Lordships, were satisfied generally with the objects of the Bill. But I understand it is desired by several noble Lords that the further consideration of this Bill should be postponed. I would not under ordinary circumstances have asked the House to take the further stages so quickly, but your Lordships will realise that the Labour Exchanges are accumulating very useful information, and the purpose of this Bill is to place this information at the disposal of boys and girls who are going into the world to enable them to know which special avenue of employment is most likely to afford them a suitable opening. That information is accumulating, and it was thought that even during the next few months the Bill, if it were passed, would prove of service. If, however, there is a desire to have more time I would not oppose a postponement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01947"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to hear the noble Earl say that if the House wish a little more time to consider this Bill he is disposed to fall in with that request. This is a Bill which met with very little consideration in the other House owing to the congestion
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0336"/>
<col>663</col>
of business during the last week or two, and the noble Earl the Lord President, through no fault of his own, was obliged to ask your Lordships to read it a second time with very short notice. Personally I must confess that I had not looked at the Bill yesterday when the noble Earl proposed its Second Reading, but I have since looked at it and also at the special rules made by the Board of Trade in pursuance of the Act, and I venture to think that if your Lordships are to consider the Bill in connection with those regulations more time is required than we are able to bestow at the present moment. The Bill confers independent powers upon the education authority. Under the Bill the education authority would be able to act quite independently and without reference to the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade, from what I have heard, is doing very good work in regard to Labour Exchanges, and it seems to me that very good reason ought to be given for setting up any other authority, whether it be the Board of Education or any other, which could act without reference to the Board of Trade. Turning to the special rules your Lordships will see that there is only one case&#x2014;that mentioned in Rule No.6&#x2014;in which the Board of Education is obliged to consult the Board of Trade with reference to this Bill. The Bill is not so simple as it seems, and it would be to the public advantage if the noble Earl would postpone its further consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01948"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to make no criticism whatever on the merits of the Bill, for I have not read the rules which the noble Earl has laid on the Table. I think it is quite clear that this matter wants careful consideration. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the value of a wise initiation of a policy for obtaining proper employment for these children. Therefore it is of the greatest importance that Parliament should not make a mistake. My noble friend Lord Hamilton of Dalzell will know that I was anxious to mention the matter in this House a few days ago, not with reference to it Bill but on a Question which might have led to discussion, but at the wish of the noble Lord and the Board of Trade I did not proceed further with the matter, and after that I am a little unwilling, to enter into a discussion of this subject on the very last day of our sittings. I therefore hope that
<col>664</col>
further time will be given for the consideration of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01949"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am interested to hear the words spoken from the opposite side of the House. I am sorry that any delay should be necessary as to bringing this Bill into early operation, but anything would be better than our bringing the Bill into operation without being sure that it is so worded as to ensure that it will work thoroughly well. The object is so indisputably good, the need is so real and so urgent, and the outline of the machinery seems to me so admirable that I should be very sorry indeed to see the Bill unnecessarily delayed. I support the Bill with all my heart, but if it be clearly understood that our desire is to expedite and to further the cause we are promoting rather than hinder it, I should join in the appeal that a little delay would be preferable to premature action, which might hereafter involve operative difficulties.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE LATE EARL SPENCER.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01974"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we proceed to the business on the Paper I feel sure that I shall be carrying out the wishes of the House by saying a word about one who has been for some years, absent from our Benches, but whom we have not forgotten and who has passed away since we were last here&#x2014;I mean Lord Spencer. Certainly on this side of the House we cannot refrain from saying something, because we cannot forget that but for the sudden blow which fell upon him in the year 1905 he would have held the foremost place on this Bench of ours during the lifetime of the present Government.<lb/>
Lord Spencer's career started at an early age. He became Viceroy of Ireland at the unusually early age of thirty-three. He afterwards held the office of President of the Council at a time when that post involved the charge of the Education Department, and he filled with distinction the office of First Lord of the Admiralty. In holding all those offices the keynotes of his character were the qualities of courage and of simplicity. Be never fell short of what was demanded by a difficult situation either when physical or moral courage was required; and as your Lordships well know, he had to encounter many difficult situations. Lord Spencer would have been the first to deprecate comparison between his capacities and those of the men who have filled the largest place in our political history of late. He was never a great orator, although he attained no little facility in speaking, and I think that he always enjoyed taking part in debates in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0340"/>
<col>671</col>
It may be true to say that for the very first. order of Statesmen a wider range of knowledge and a more complex or even more subtle character are required. If we regard the figures of the half-dozen men who have held the highest political places in the last hundred years we might he disposed to arrive at that conclusion. But of this I am certain, that it will be an ill day for public life in this country when men of the type of Lord Spencer cease to take a prominent part in our politics. Lord Spencer was also conspicuous in other aspects. In his own county he was for years the foremost figure, whether in county business or in those field sports in which he was such an acknowledged expert.. I cannot forget, too, the interest that he took in the great school of Harrow, of which he was so distinguished a son. My Lords, I need say no more, but I desired, holding the position I do, to lay this tribute on the grave of a high-minded Statesman whose memory will long be preserved with affection in the minds of all those who had the privilege of knowing him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01975"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that your Lordships without exception will consider it suitable and proper that Lord Spencer's death should not be allowed to pass by without some notice in this House, in which virtually the whole of his public career was spent. I think I am right in saying- that Lord Spencer had a seat in the House of Lords for somewhere about half a century, and during a great part of that period he held a position very conspicuous and in all respects honoured and respected. Lord Spencer held more than one high office, and left behind the reputation of a courageous and hard-working administrator. Of Lord Spencer's position in this House the noble Earl spoke, I thought, in terms characterised by his usual felicity of description. No one, I suppose, and least of all Lord Spencer himself, would have claimed for him that he possessed in a high degree the gift of eloquence; but in all public assemblies there are men who carry weight, not on account of their power of language, not on account of their ability to clothe their thoughts in ornate or picturesque words, but from their common sense, their character, and their courage. Those were all of them attributes which Lord Spencer possessed in the highest degree.<lb/>
<col>672</col>
My Lords, for some time we have missed Lord Spencer from his place in this House; and now that death has taken him we realise what a loss Parliament and the country have sustained. To you he appeared as a trusted colleague and a valued Party leader. To us on this side of the House he always seemed an honourable and generous adversary. All parties and all sections in this House regarded him as a member of whom the House of Lords might well be proud. There were some&#x2014;and I trust that I may be permitted to count myself among the numberj&#x2014;who knew him not only as a public man, but as a private friend, and who felt towards him not only sincere respect but a very deep and hearty affection.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01976"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to ask the noble Earl opposite a question of which I have given him private notice. Is he able to give the House this evening any information as to the course of public business during the early days of the session?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01977"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, through some error for which I am certain the noble Marquess is in no way responsible I failed to receive the private notice of which he has spoken; but he and the House, I am sure, will understand that in the absence of any statement as to the general course of public business by my right hon. friend in another place, I am not able to give to-day a definite answer to the question which has just been put. As the House is aware, there is not much business on the Paper for this week, and the first important question that comes before us is a Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal on the Cross Benches (Lord Roberts) which is put down for Monday next. I am afraid that I can say nothing to-day of the intentions of His Majesty's Government with regard to business; but I will endeavour to give the information as soon as I am in a position to make a similar statement to that which will be made by my right hon. friend in another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01978"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we were prepared to hear of the inability of His Majesty's Government to give us any very definite information as to what was to happen during the next
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0341"/>
<col>673</col>
day or two, but I confess that I for one was not prepared for such a complete inability to throw any light whatever upon the further proceedings of this House. I should not have pursued the question further, but I think it may be for the general convenience that I should at once make an announcement which I think ought not to be longer deferred. It is this: that I shall move to-morrow a Motion in the following terms&#x2014;
<quote>"That this House invites His Majesty's Govern-meat to submit without further delay the provisions of the Parliament Bill for the consideration and decision of Parliament."</quote>
The Parliament Bill, I need not remind your Lordships, is the Bill which was introduced in April last and read a first time in the House of Commons. Its full title is&#x2014;
<quote>"A Bill to make provision with respect to the powers of the House of Lords in relation to those of the Rouse of Commons, and to limit the duration of Parliaments."</quote>
I desire now, if the House will kindly give me its attention for a moment, to say a few words upon another subject connected with the Conference, the proceedings of which terminated a few days ago. That Conference was held upon the condition that absolute secrecy should be maintained with regard to its proceedings. I think that was a wise decision, and for this reason, and perhaps for this reason alone. Some of us are not without hopes that, although this particular Conference was not productive of a definite conclusion, other Conferences may be held and may be more successful in their results. If that is so, it seems to me to follow that the one condition which holds out any hope of good results ensuing from that particular mode of dealing with political difficulties is that the discussions should be held under time seal of absolute secrecy. The policy of secrecy is, however, attended by this great inconvenience. The public is necessarily without authentic accounts of that which takes place; and therefore the purveyors of information make it their business to supply the public with accounts which are not authentic, and which are based largely, or entirely, upon conjecture and the collection of those straws of gossip which may be found flying about in the purlieus of Whitehall. It occurs to one naturally enough that if these unauthorised statements are prevalent they may be contradicted. Some of us, I think probably the noble Earl him
<col>674</col>
self, must have been sorely tempted during the last few days to rush into print. But there is this fatal objection, that the moment you begin contradicting these misrepresentations the public draws the conclusion that every statement which is not so contradicted is accurate and deserving of trust. Therefore, my Lords, painful though it may be to us sometimes to hold our peace, I think we must make up our minds to suffer in silence.<lb/>
But there are some misstatements which I do not think fall quite within this category. I refer particularly to misstatements affecting not what happened inside the Conference but what happened outside it; and it is with regard to one of these misstatements that I desire to say a few words before I sit down. I find in the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> of last Friday a statement from which I take the following essential passages. In the leading article of that day, based on a statement which appeared in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, I find the following passage&#x2014;
<quote>"The Mail takes up the story from the beginning of this month, when it assumes that settlement through the device of a Joint Committee was in sight."</quote>
Quoting from the Mail the article goes on thus&#x2014;
<quote>"Hopes of a satisfactory settlement were bright&#x2026;A. week ago it was agreed that Mr. Balfour should lay the proposals of the Conference before his more intimate colleagues in his last Ministry. The position taken up by an influential section of Unionist Peers who had not been members of the Conference was this: 'If we are to be deprived of our powers, let it be done by the constituencies and not by any Conference'. Their opposition to the joint Committee carried the day, and it only remained for Mr. Balfour to announce this decision to Mr. Asquith."</quote>
Upon this the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> comments as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The Conference broke, according to this account, because the Peers would not let Mr. Balfour accept a settlement which the <i>Daily Mail</i> describes as 'satisfactory.' 'Their opposition carried the day, and it only remained for Mr. Balfour to announce the decision to Mr. Asquith&#x2026;'if we are to be deprived of our powers' say the Peers&#x2014;we quote the exact words of the <i>Daily Mail</i>&#x2014; let it be done by the constituencies and not by any Conference.'"</quote>
My Lords, I have drawn attention to this statement because I desire to qualify it here as without foundation. There has been no consultation either with the Unionist Peers as a whole, or with a section of the Unionist Peers, and it is untrue that the Conference broke down because the Peers or a section of the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0342"/>
<col>675</col>
Peers would not allow Mr. Balfour to accept the terms which were within his reach. It seems to me that this contradiction is necessary. I think it is due to your Lordships that it should be made, and I conceive that this is the proper place in which to make it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01979"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I can only say a word by leave of the House, because there is no question before us; but with respect to the two matters raised by the noble Marquess in his speech, I have to say, first, that when he makes his Motion to-morrow I hope to be in a position to state the intentions of His Majesty's Government with regard to the Parliament Bill. As regards the second matter of which the noble Marquess spoke, I am in full agreement with him as to the reasons for maintaining that obligation of confidence which has surrounded the Conference from the first. The reasons which he so happily put forward seemed to me conclusive, even if there were no others, against any attempt to describe for the benefit of a curious public precisely what occurred during the twenty-one days of our consultations.<lb/>
I am not, I think, called upon to say anything as regards the contradiction of a rumour that appeared in a newspaper which is ordinarily supposed to support the views of noble Lords opposite, and was, therefore, as the noble Marquess points out, erroneously supposed to be in possession of accurate information as to what occurred outside the Conference. The noble Marquess was, of course, entirely within his rights in repudiating that statement, and I can only say for myself that so far as any rumours have prevailed as to what happened in regard to the Conference, either within the Conference room or outside of it, I personally, and I think I can speak also for my colleagues, do not propose to offer any contradiction of any statement, however preposterous it may be. Rumours and fancies of that kind must, I think, be left to work their own contradiction, for I am quite in accord with the noble Marquess that the moment one begins contradicting there is always a danger that any statement that remains uncontradicted is taken. as being accurate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01980"><member>THE EARL OF ROSE BERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have only one word to say with reference to the question before the House which appears to be concerned with the course of
<col>676</col>
public business. His Majesty's Government, no doubt, possess the confidence of Parliament, or of one House of Parliament, but I must say that that confidence is not very fully reciprocated on their part. We met to-day in the hope of a statement. We were first told that this statement would be deferred till to-morrow, and now I understand it is to be deferred till Friday. From day to clay we wake up to read new announcements, all apparently of equal authority, in the newspapers with regard to the confidential statements with which His Majesty's Government are prepared to repay the unlimited confidence which they and their Conference have received from the nation during the last few months. I confess I think that Parliament is treated somewhat scurvily in this matter. But that is not the point I wish to raise.<lb/>
There is one matter with which I am personally connected and to which this House is also deeply pledged&#x2014;I mean the Resolutions which stand in my name on the Paper. My noble friend behind me has just given notice of a Motion to invite, so to speak, the Government to bring forward their Parliament Bill at the earliest possible moment. Of course I do not know what answer the Government will return to my noble friend's invitation; but in the meantime what becomes of the Resolutions? They are the outcome of the wish of the majority of the House of Lords to reform itself. I, myself, am very sceptical as to the good results, or any results, that may accrue from discussing the Parliament Bill of the Government or the Veto Resolutions of the Government before these Resolutions of mine have been discussed and either passed or rejected by this House; but I am in the hands of the noble Marquess. I quite acknowledge that the course which he considers most expedient will be the one followed by this House or by the majority of this House, but, at the same time, I do wish to know from him what position he occupies relatively to these Resolutions, and whether, in the event of the menaced life of the House of Commons being unexpectedly prolonged, there will be an opportunity afforded us, before or after the Parliament Bill has been discussed, of entering on the consideration of these Resolutions again.<lb/>
I must state my own earnest conviction that the Resolutions ought to be taken at once&#x2014;that they ought to be taken tomorrow rather than not at all&#x2014;I think
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0343"/>
<col>677</col>
they ought to take precedence of any measure of the Government dealing with this subject, and we have the emphatic pledge of my noble friend opposite that they should take that precedence. Therefore I confess that it is with some misgiving&#x2014;though I admit the superior political sagacity of the noble Marquess&#x2014;that I heard the proposition which may shelve or delay the immediate consideration of my Resolutions by this House. I came to London yesterday fully prepared to put down these Resolutions for to-morrow, if necessary, rather than postpone them, and I must state my conviction that that would be the best course for this House to adopt&#x2014;rather to sit and discuss these Resolutions all night tomorrow than run the risk of a Dissolution being announced on Friday and leaving the House without having had any opportunity of discussing them at all.<lb/>
Remember what has happened with regard to the Resolutions. The most immediate, the most capital of them was passed by this House&#x2014;that in which the House renounced the hereditary right to legislate, which is, after all, the keystone of the whole matter. At that period the House adjourned and an event took place which filled the nation with mourning and created an entirely new situation of affairs. That event also produced another change. It produced the Conference, and it was then stated and held, though I confess I was not in perfect agreement with that opinion, that during the Conference the House of Lords should suspend the consideration of its Resolutions. Now it appears from all I can gather from the organs of public opinion, which are probably better informed on this subject than my noble friend opposite, that no opportunity will be given to this House to discuss these Resolutions at all. I gang of course, in the hands of the House, but I must protest, if that be the course which is going to be taken, against the treatment which has been accorded to this House and to its projected Resolutions of reform.</membercontribution></p>

<li>10. The number of non-commissioned officers and men required to form two Mounted Brigades according to the War Establishment, 1910.</li>
<li>11. The number of non-commissioned officers and men required for the Regular Mounted Infantry in place of the Non-Regular Cavalry for the six Infantry Divisions, as scheduled in Table 1 of Army Memorandum of 8th April, 1907.</li>
<li>12. The number of Regular Reservists required to bring up to war establishment the Regular Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry not included in the Expeditionary- Force, but retained at home for the defence of the United Kingdom.</li>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01982"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answers to the noble Duke's Questions are as follow: To Question 1, the answer is 118,814; to Question 2, 32,970; to Question 3, ten per cent.; to Question 4, 13,603; to Question 5, 138,000&#x2014;that is the number taken in the Army Estimates, and it covers Section D; there is no separate estimate for Sections A and B. The answer to Question 6 is 131,267, made up of 106,372 Sections A and B, and 24,895 Section D. The reply to Question 7 is 7,198, and to Question 8, 1,739 (on November 5, 1910). In the first part of Question 9 the noble Duke asks for the total deficiencies of non-commissioned officers and men in the Special Contingent. The number is 6,622. With regard to the second part of Question 9, the deficiencies will be made up in various ways according to what seems best at the time; they will probably be made up out of Reservists who are surplus for mobilisation purposes to other arms, by special enlistment, and in ways of that kind. To Question 10, the answer is 5,765; to Question 11, 2,016; to Question 12, 3,729; to Question 13, ten per cent. With regard to Question 14, 24,895 is the estimated strength of Section D provided it is kept open the whole time. Section D is not the second class of the Army Reserve; it is now always classed in the first class of the Army Reserve. In reply to Question 15, assuming that Section D is meant, the period of absence of the three-years man will normally be&#x2014;minimum nine years, maximum thirteen years. Men of certain special trades, such as farriers, saddlers, who are permitted to re-engage in Section D,
<col>680</col>
may be longer away from the Colours&#x2014;maximum, seventeen years. The same applies to men of the Royal Horse Artillery, Royal Field Artillery, Cavalry, and Army Service Corps who are permitted to re-engage. The reply to Question 16 is, ten per cent. As to Question 17, I cannot give the noble Duke the actual numbers of Section D that will be required. But the number of Special Reservists required will be 15,175, made up of Irish Horse, 336; Royal Field Artillery, 5,046; Royal Engineers, 1,257; Army Service Corps, 5,808; Royal Army Medical Corps, 2,201; and Army Veterinary Corps, 527.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-01984"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The total number of officers, non-commissioned officers and men deficient in all branches, combatant and non-combatant, of the Territorial Force on September 30, 1910, was: officers, 1,451; non-commissioned officers and men, 43,923. This figure as to officers does not take into account the officers on the

Unattached List or the officers of the Officers Training Corps, as these do not count against the Establishment. In reply-to Question 2, the number of non-commissioned officers and men serving under twenty years of age on October 1 fast was 83,346; the ages of officers cannot be given. As to Questions 3 and 4, I cannot supply the noble Duke with the numbers, because the musketry returns are not due until the end of this month. It takes a considerable time to tabulate them, and I am afraid I shall not be able to give them this year. With regard to Question 5, the numbers of officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Territorial Force who were absent with and without leave from camp in 1910 were: Absent with leave&#x2014;officers, 1,377; non-commissioned officers and men, 20,126.

<title>TERRITORIAL FIELD ARTILLERY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01985"><member>THE EARL OF STRADBROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I beg to put the Question which stands in my name on the Paper&#x2014;viz.: To ask the Under-Secretary of State for War whether he can give the date at which howitzers will be supplied to the Territorial Field Artillery to complete their proper number; and whether there are a sufficient number of the old pattern howitzers now in use in the British Isles in the Regular Artillery to meet the deficiency in the Territorial Brigades.<lb/>
I might remind your Lordships that, in replying to a Question of a. similar nature in this House during the summer, the noble Lord the Under-Secretary held out the hope to the Territorial Force that they would shortly receive their complement of guns. The noble Lord then stated that the reorganisation of the Regular Forces would commence in a few days, and that as the old guns were replaced by the new ones the discarded guns would be passed on to the Territorial Brigades. That statement was made four months ago, and it would be interesting if the noble Lord could tell your Lordships how many howitzers have since that elate been so passed on. With regard to the latter part of my Question, I might perhaps explain that a number of howitzer brigades are quartered outside the. British Isles, and that there is a feeling that when these brigades are furnished with new howitzers the old guns may be scrapped to save the
<col>682</col>
expense of sending them back to this country, and that thus the Territorial Force will not receive their full equipment. I hope the noble Lord will be able to dispel this fear, and to make a statement which will be encouraging to the Territorial Force as to the reception by them of the guns necessary to make up their complement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-01986"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The issue of the new howitzers to the Regulars should commence in January next, and shortly afterwards it will be possible to begin transferring the howitzers now in the hands of the Regular Artillery to the batteries of the Territorial Force. At this moment it is not possible to give actual dates, but the manufacturers are hastening as much as possible the completion of the new weapons. When the noble Earl last raised this question I told him that the issue was going to be made in September. It is true that we began the issue of the new howitzers to the Regulars last September, but it was found necessary to recall them as certain slight modifications had to be made, and this has been the cause of the delay. These modifications are now being made. We hope that in a month or two the alterations found to be necessary will be completed, and then the Territorials will receive their howitzers. With regard to the second part of the Question, I may say that there are plenty of these guns in this country, and that there will be a sufficient number available for arming the whole of the howitzer batteries of the Territorial Force.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"That it would be a danger to the Realm, and limit the power of the Navy as an offensive force in war, to trust to it alone for home defence; and, inasmuch as it is admitted that the Navy cannot guarantee us against so-called hostile raids,' it is the more needful that our land defences should at all times be such that no Nation would ever attempt, in any form, a hostile landing on our shores."</quote></membercontribution></p>

But I am inclined to ask the House whether, in view of the Motion to be brought forward by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, it would be wise on this occasion to attempt to enter into the details of this matter, or to give a reasoned reply in any sense to the Question. To answer the Question fully would involve a long statement of the kind to which your Lordships have not been unaccustomed in previous debates on this subject of Defence, and we should find ourselves in the position, I think, of having to say again on the Motion of Lord Roberts what had been said to-day.

<title>THE PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02003"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member> rose to move to resolve&#x2014;
<quote>"That this House invites His Majesty's Government to submit without further delay the provisions of the Parliament Bill for the consideration and decision of Parliament."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02004">The noble Marquess said: My Lords, I will begin the few observations which I wish to make to the House by a word of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0347"/>
<col>685</col>
apology for the apparently indecent haste with which I have put this important Notice on the Paper of your Lordships' House. The subject is one which deserves full and deliberate debate, and for many reasons I should have preferred to have given a longer notice; moreover, I am afraid that my somewhat precipitate action has had incidentally the effect of depriving my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery) of an opportunity of which he desired to take advantage this evening. I imagine that both of us were actuated by the same motives. We had reason to believe that the Parliamentary time at our disposal was likely to be very much curtailed, and both of us would have been glad while time permitted, if I may use a familiar expression, to "jump a claim" within the very limited space which was open to our activity. I apologise to the noble Earl, and I assure him that nothing would have been further from my thoughts than to stand in his way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02005">But, my Lords, we are given to understand by those who are usually in a position to speak with authority that we are on the eve of a Dissolution and a General Election; and I desire to point out to the House that, should this be the case, one of the results will be that the whole of the business now before both Houses of Parliament will be by a stroke wiped off the Order Paper and put on one side for an indefinite time. That is a very serious matter. I am not sure whether I should be in order in dwelling at length upon it, but I am tempted to point out that one consequence will be, I presume, that the whole of the finance of the year will be thrown into what was described on a former occasion as "a state of irremediable chaos and confusion." But I will not follow up that point. The particular business in which I hope your Lordships will interest yourselves tonight is the proposals which have been made in this House and in the other House of Parliament for dealing with the relations of the two Houses. In this House we have the Resolutions of my noble friend on the Cross Benches, some of which have been passed, others of which remain on the Notice Paper. In the House of Commons we have had the Veto Resolutions passed, and a Bill dealing with the relations of the two Houses introduced and read a first time. The whole of
<col>686</col>
those proposals, if we are right in believing that a Dissolution is imminent, will be swept away in the cataclysm, and I do venture to suggest that if that should happen it will be a very grave public misfortune, and, I cannot help adding, a very wanton affront to Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02006">I should like to remind the House in a few words how we stand in reference to these two sets of proposals. Both Parties, to begin with, in both Houses admit, and admit freely, that there is a great constitutional question which requires to be dealt with. Both Parties in both Houses admit that that question has two parts. There is the question of the powers of the House of Lords, and there is the question of the composition of that House. Up to that point there is an agreement. as to the existence of the question, and I think I may say further an agreement that the question is at this moment more urgent than it has ever been in the history of our public life. The Party represented on the Benches opposite has concentrated its attention entirely upon the question of the powers of the House of Lords. On our side it would, perhaps, not be incorrect to say that we have concentrated our attention, if not entirely, mainly, at any rate, upon the other branch of the subject&#x2014;I mean the composition of this House. Your predominant feeling, if I may so put it, has been one of resentment at the interference of the House of Lords in important questions which have been dealt with by the House of Commons. Our predominant feeling has been that the whole question is prejudiced by the exclusively hereditary character of this Assembly, by its excessive numbers, by the disproportionate representation of Parties within it, and by the need of reinforcement from outside. It is, perhaps, to be regretted that each side has been so much absorbed in its own quest that it has not taken sufficiently into account the extent to which these two great questions are connected and interdependent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02007">We in this House feel strongly that it is impossible to deal, adequately with the question of the powers of the House of Lords until we know what sort of a House of Lords it is that we are talking about. The real question in our view is not what are the powers which you can give to an imperfectly constituted House, but what are the powers which any Second Chamber
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0348"/>
<col>687</col>
in any civilised community ought to be entrusted with, and, if this House as at present constituted is not fit to be entrusted with those powers, what are the changes which are necessary in order to render it competent for the discharge of its duties in a manner will command the confidence of the people of this country. I do not think I put it too high when I say that it is tinkering and not statesmanship to leave one House of Parliament in a condition which you admit yourselves to be unsatisfactory, and upon that pretext to deny it the powers of revision and reservation without which no Second Chamber can adequately do its work. This House has been ready with its contribution towards the solution of this most difficult problem. We have passed some of the Resolutions moved by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. Speaking for many of those who sit by me, I may say that we are ready to support him when he moves, if lie does, the other Resolutions he has put on the Paper. I at any rate regard myself as committed to the view that it is desirable that there should be a reduction in the number of your Lordships' House, that no Peer should be allowed to sit and vote in it merely in virtue of his hereditary right, that a new House of Lords should include an adequate representation of the best and most representative elements to be found in the present House, and that it should be reinforced from outside, either by nomination or by some kind of election. And, my Lords, I add to that&#x2014;and here, again, I feel no doubt that most of my friends would support me&#x2014;that we are all of us ready to devise, if we can, some means by which, when differences of opinion arise between the two Houses, those differences of opinion might be solved in a reasonable, and, if possible, amicable manner. That, I say, is the contribution which 1 believe this House is ready to make, and I trust that your Lordships will not consider that it is by any means a negligible contribution, or a contribution which does not deserve to be carefully considered and examined by His Majesty's Government alongside of any proposals which they may have it in their mind to make for dealing with the other branch of the question&#x2014;I mean the powers of this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02008">If that is the contribution which the House of Lords is ready to make, what of
<col>688</col>
the contribution which is offered from the other side? We are all familiar with the so-called Veto Resolutions which were passed through the House of Commons in the summer of this year. I am not going to examine them this evening; but what I do wish to insist upon as strongly as I can is this, that those Resolutions were put forward by the Prime Minister not as in any sense a complete attempt to deal with the subject in view. He dwelt again and again upon the fact that the Resolutions were merely preliminary to a Bill in which the Government scheme was to be more fully unfolded, and which&#x2014;and I call attention to this in particular&#x2014;was to be fully discussed in Parliament in all its stages. I think I have quoted the words of the Prime Minister with substantial accuracy. I also wish to point this out, that in dealing with the subject the Prime Minister was careful to indicate that the procedure embodied in his Resolutions by no means covered the whole of the ground. He dwelt in particular on the possibility of devising some means of reconciling the two Houses when a difference might arise between them, and he referred pointedly to the possibility of a Joint Session, which he said had a great many recommendations. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"This scheme of a joint Session has, I think, a great many recommendations, and I desire to say most distinctly, here and now, that if you have two legislative Chambers composed upon a democratic basis and related to one another somewhat after the fashion I indicated earlier in my speech with a proper numerical relation one to the other, I think there is a good deal to be said for settling differences that might arise between them by means of a joint session."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02009">I wish to be quite fair to the Prime Minister. He was speaking then of two legislative Chambers composed upon a democratic basis. That is a somewhat elastic expression, but as I said a moment ago, we are quite ready to entertain the idea of changes in this House which would import to these Benches Peers of Parliament who would sit there in respect of what can only, I think, be properly described as a democratic title of one kind or another.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02010">There was another important suggestion that was touched upon by the Prime Minister&#x2014;I mean the possibility of resorting to the Referendum. He said the Referendum might be&#x2014;
<quote>"possibly the least objectionable means of untying the knot in some extreme and exceptional constitutional entanglement";</quote></p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0349"/>
<col>689</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02011">and bearing upon that he made this observation. He expressed his conviction that&#x2014;
<quote>"the will of the people, by which we mean the will of the majority of the people for the time being, shall both in legislation and policy prevail."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02012">He was careful to explain that the will of the people was not always conclusively expressed by the majority of opinion in the other House of Parliament. For he added this&#x2014;
<quote>"It may be that representatives of the people in a particular case have mistaken the terms of their authority. It may again be that the majority by which a particular measure is passed through this House is so small or so obviously casual and heterogeneous that its verdict ought not to be treated as expressing the considered judgment of the nation."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02013">Therefore the Prime Minister had in view the possibility of an appeal to the considered judgment of the nation as something distinct from the verdict for the moment given in the other House of Parliament. The Prime Minister, I need not say, dealt with this subject in a broad and judicial spirit, and his observations would have naturally suggested the hope that all these ideas would have been followed up and thoroughly discussed in both Houses of Parliament. But that Parliamentary discussion to which the Prime Minister looked forward never took place. The Resolutions were passed, but the alternatives suggested by the Prime Minister never obtained any consideration whatever. That is how the matter stands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02014">I have endeavoured to put before you what; has been contributed, on the one hand by this House and on the other by the House of Commons, towards the treatment of this constitutional question. That is how the matter stood until a very few days ago. What has happened since? What is it that, unless we are misinformed, has determined His Majesty's Government to abandon the further investigation of these enormously important questions, and to cut everything short by precipitately dissolving Parliament? There is only one answer, as far as I am aware. That answer is that in the meantime the Conference has failed. This Parliament is not a year old. His Majesty's Government have undergone no defeat. They are going to the country &#x2014;at least, so we are informed&#x2014;simply because the eight gentlemen who until a few days ago were sitting in secret conclave within a stone's throw of this building were
<col>690</col>
unable to arrive at a conclusion which they could recommend their supporters to adopt. I venture to remind your Lordships what this Conference was. It was purely informal; it was held in secret; it was understood from the first that whatever was offered and accepted across the table was offered and accepted without prejudice. Those who took part in it were not plenipotentiaries. I do not think we can even consider that they were, in the proper sense of the word, the delegates of their Parties. I noticed a statement made a few days ago by a distinguished member of that Conference, Mr. Birrell. Mr. Birrell I think, summed up the case very aptly. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I kept no notes. My memory is very treacherous. I propose to put a sponge over the Conference and all that took place within it."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02015">That is, I submit, a perfectly correct and statesmanlike view of the position. Apparently His Majesty's Government intend to regard the failure of the Conference to come to an agreement as justifying them in the abandonment of all further discussion of the question. Perhaps the noble Earl will tell me that it is idle to expect that where the Conference failed Parliament will succeed. My Lords, I venture to say that we have no right whatever to assume, because eight members drawn from the two Front Benches did their best to come to an agreement and were unsuccessful, that for that reason Parliament is to be deprived of an opportunity of dealing with these great constitutional problems. I should be sorry, and so, I think, would every member of the Conference, to assume that we possess a monopoly of knowledge or of diplomatic gilts which entitle our failure to be regarded as conclusive evidence that success in any other mode is unattainable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02016">What I wish to ask your Lordships to consider is whether it is wholly inconceivable that matters might be advanced if we could so arrange that, on the one hand, my noble friend on the Cross Benches should persevere with his Resolutions, and that, on the other, His Majesty's Government should, in accordance with their original undertaking, proceed in both Houses with the Parliament Bill. That Bill contains, no doubt, many provisions about which we should have a good deal to say, but I venture to say that there are certain propositions in it which would obtain a very
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0350"/>
<col>691</col>
general measure of adhesion from all political Parties and in all parts of this House. I find in that Bill these four propositions directly or indirectly affirmed. First, that there is a need of regulating the relations of the two Houses of Parliament. I do not think anybody will contest that. Secondly, that it is desirable that the House of Lords should be reformed. We, at any rate, are not likely to controvert that proposition. In the third place, I find the claim that the House of Commons is entitled to preponderance in all cases where purely financial considerations are involved. If that is interpreted in a reasonable manner, I for one shall certainly not quarrel with that claim. And, fourthly, I find the principle that it is necessary to provide us with some machinery, at present non-existent, to relieve the Houses should they unfortunately become involved in a serious difference of opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02017">Now, my Lords, is it really reasonable to contend that because the Conference was unable to arrive at an agreement, it is therefore idle for Parliament even to discuss these great questions? I cannot believe that that question can be answered in the affirmative. If that is so, surely the first step which, logically and constitutionally, His Majesty's Government ought to take is to give Parliament an opportunity of getting to close quarters with the Bill which contains their proposals for dealing with the question. They should give Parliament an opportunity of getting to close quarters with that Bill, of criticising it, of suggesting amendments in it. That was the course which, as I have endeavoured to show, His Majesty's Government themselves contemplated at the outset, and I am quite unable to suggest or to discover any reasons for which they should not adopt that course now. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02018"><i>Moved</i> to resolve, That this House invites His Majesty's Government to submit without further delay the provisions of the Parliament Bill for the consideration and decision of Parliament.&#x2014;(<i>The Marquess of Lansdowne.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02019"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we must all, I think, have been impressed with the moderate tone in which the noble Marquess approached the discussion of this subject, and though I fear that I can find myself in agreement with very little
<col>692</col>
that he said, yet I fully appreciate the temper with which he has dealt with this difficult question&#x2014;a question which, as we know, excites profound feeling in many quarters; and I hope that the remainder of the debate may be conducted on similar lines. I make no complaint of the actual Motion made by the noble Marquess. He invites His Majesty's Government to submit, without further delay, the provisions of the Parliament Bill for the consideration and decision of Parliament. I do not think that that, in the circumstances, can be called an unreasonable request, and it is a request with which we are willing to comply. I am prepared to move, and propose to move, the First Reading of the Bill this evening, and we can consider, probably later on, what day your Lordships might desire to take the Second Reading.<lb/>
The noble Marquess travelled over a very wide field. He entered into an analysis both of the action of your Lordships' House with regard to the reform of the constitution of the House and the action of His Majesty's Government with regard to the relations which exist between the two Houses, and he certainly did not overstate the case when he said that the thoughts and energies of the two Parties had respectively been devoted in the main to one subject in each case rather than to the other. I think the noble Marquess might have gone even further, because I have never heard from those Benches any admission, in the course of the many discussions we have had, that there was any question of accepting a limitation of the powers of this House beyond the well known limitations which custom and prescription place on your Lordships at present. I am bound to say, if we had known or supposed that such limitations were subjects for discussion and, possibly, for agreement with noble Lords opposite, our task would have been an easier one in the past. But we have never heard a hint of anything of the kind. We have heard of nothing but reform of the constitution of your Lordships' House, with the understanding, expressed or implied, that the reconstitution of the House would give it such authority in the eyes of the country that it ought to retain the whole of its present powers. I really do not think any noble Lord opposite will contradict me when I say this. It is true that we have, partly for that very reason, mainly directed
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0351"/>
<col>693</col>
our attention to the other branch of the question, but we have not neglected the first. We have never left out of sight the practical certainty that any dealing with the question must involve some reform in the constitution of your Lordships' House. No proposal that we have ever' made is hostile to or incompatible with the reform, drastic or otherwise, of your Lordships' House, and, although we have found it necessary to take one thing at a time, yet we have never in our speeches or in our proposals ignored the question to which, as we think, your Lordships at large have too exclusively devoted yourselves.<lb/>
In considering the relations between the two Houses we have all through felt compelled to take, for the time being, the House as it is, and I do not see how we could have adopted any other course. If we are to deal in any way with the existing relations we must consider what the two bodies are as they exist at this moment and take those relations as they stand. It seems to me that it would be equally futile for your Lordships to consider those relations on the theory that the House of Commons might be replaced by some different kind of House under some of the schemes which we have lately seen. ventilated in the newspapers. When you deal with the House of Commons you deal with the House of Commons as it is, and the House of Commons is obliged to deal with your Lordships as you are, leaving out the possibility that in course of time the, constitution of this House may be something different.<lb/>
I understand that the gist of the noble Marquess's, I will not say request, but desire is that this House should have more time given to reform itself before the question of the relations between the two Houses is considered. Nobody has ever hurried the House of Lords over this question of reform. The question of the reform of your Lordships' constitution has been before you and before the country for very many years. My noble friend on the Cross Benches has devoted to it from quite his early days in the House &#x2014;and he came to it young&#x2014;all the resources of his unequalled eloquence and his great influence in this House. But for reasons which it is needless now to discuss, absolutely nothing has been done. Not only has absolutely nothing been
<col>694</col>
done, but there has been even during these late discussions very little apparent approach to agreement as to what ought to be done.<lb/>
The noble Marquess expressed a general approval of the further Resolutions of my noble friend. He went through them and pointed out in terms that he was able to give something of a benediction to them all. But the noble Marquess did not state what is the <i>crux</i> of the whole question &#x2014;namely, that everything depends on the manner in which these particular proposals are going to be applied. It means nothing to say that you are prepared to add some more Peers to your Lordships' House who are not hereditary Peers. As we know, there are a few here already. Are you going to add ten more. or are you going to make more than half the House of a composition of that kind? We have never had a hint from any quarter as to what the proportion is to be. In the same way with regard to hereditary Peers. It is proposed to leave a certain number of hereditary Peers. Are you going to leave more than half the House, or are you going to turn everybody out except a hundred? Those are questions which from every point of view are of tremendous magnitude, and nobody has ever yet been able to bring himself to express an opinion as to how they are going to be answered. Therefore, when we are apparently told that some sort of agreement ought to be in sight as between the Parties, I can only say that there is no agreement that I know of in sight in the Party opposite, and, until you are able to agree what sort of a House it is you want, it does not seem reasonable to ask us, knowing as you do our views on the general subject, to discuss with you these questions of the highest importance, but at the same time questions of detail.<lb/>
Now I come to what the noble Marquess said on the subject of the Conference, and I am sorry to say that I do not find myself in agreement with his conclusion. His conclusion appears to be this&#x2014;that the Conference having, broken down, as we all regret it did, the whole affair can he absolutely wiped off the slate, and that we return to the position in which we were before the Conference began. In a sense that is true. We do return to the position in which we stood, so far as the propositions which either side was willing
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0352"/>
<col>695</col>
to bring forward, or did bring forward, are concerned. But what have we done? We have, in my opinion, conclusively shown that it is hopeless to settle this question by agreement in this Parliament. The noble Marquess said&#x2014;I am not quoting his words, but the sense was this&#x2014;is it reasonable to assume that, because eight gentlemen sitting round a table failed to agree, Parliament will not agree? I do not assume it. I know it, so far as it is possible to know anything of the kind. If you place in a room, for the purposes of free and open discussion of a confidential character, eight persons, all of some experience and some with a great deal of experience, and they fail to come to an agreement, is it conceivable, with all the passions which are aroused, that, by the admission, so to speak, to that Conference of men holding the most extreme views on both sides&#x2014;men who hold the most violently Radical views and men holding violently Conservative views&#x2014;is it conceivable that by adding them to your number you are going to arrive at an agreement on the points which the Conference was unable to settle? It seems to me hopeless to suppose that such a result could be the outcome of such a discussion. It would, I am sure, be regarded by the country as an absolute waste of time.<lb/>
What we have come to is this. It is evident now that in its main lines&#x2014;I do not say in the ultimate form which it may assume&#x2014;the question must be settled by one Party or the other. We have failed to agree on those main lines, and therefore, if the question is to be settled at all, one Party or the other must have the general shaping of the outlines upon which it is to be framed. That I take now to be as clearly proved as anything in politics can be proved. And for this reason, to attempt to enter into a discussion, interesting though I have no doubt it would be, of the proposals for reform or of alternative proposals which might be brought forward for dealing with questions actually covered by the Parliament Bill would be, as I say, a waste of time. I think your Lordships are thoroughly entitled to express your opinion, and I. have no doubt you will, upon the actual propositions in the Parliament Bill; but I may as well say clearly at once that we cannot lend ourselves to any discussion of alternative proposals. We are prepared to put this measure before tile House for the House to take
<col>696</col>
or for the House to leave; but it would, we think, be an absolute mockery to attempt to rediscuss here all the matters which have been so freely spoken of in the Press as having been discussed in the Conference. For that reason, although we shall welcome a debate on this subject, as I say, we cannot offer to assist noble Lords opposite in covering the whole ground.<lb/>
I only want to say one word about the proposals of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. I quite agree that my noble friend has suffered severely by the manner in which the discussion upon his Resolutions has proceeded, but that has not, I think, been our fault. He has been one of the many victims of the sad event which darkened the summer months. I think I am accurate in saying that my noble friend was never asked from this side not to go on with the discussion of his Resolutions, but he undoubtedly felt, as he, I think, told us last night, that if a discussion began on the subject at all it would be difficult to limit its area, and we might have found ourselves discussing those more controversial questions affecting the relations between the two Houses at a time when it was agreed that controversial matters should not be discussed, and in that regard I certainly sympathise with my noble friend, because it would, I think, from all points of view have been advantageous if your Lordships' views on those particular proposals had been formulated somewhat more definitely than they are. Of course, in time you are bound to have opportunities&#x2014;frequent opportunities&#x2014;of stating exactly what your views are, but it certainly does not seem to me that anything would be gained by attempting to carry on those discussions now, discussions which might conceivably occupy a great deal of time, and therefore I am afraid that we cannot, so far as we have anything to do with it, hold out any prospect to my noble friend of being able to assist him in carrying on the discussion. I have nothing more to say. I am sorry to find myself, after the weeks that the noble Marquess and I have spent in discussing this question in a different way, so completely at variance with him this evening, but I have thought it better to be absolutely plain as to what our point of view is. As I say, I propose at the end of business to move the First Reading of the Bill, and I will ask noble Lords opposite if
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0353"/>
<col>697</col>
they will be good enough to give me some indication as to when they think the debate on the Second Reading might properly be taken. For myself I am quite willing to take it on as early a date as may be found suitable to noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02020"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I do not rise to make a speech, but merely to ask a question. My noble friend says he has been perfectly plain and clear, and so I suppose it is owing to the defect of my understanding that I have not in the least understood what he has announced. For example, will your Lordships be allowed a proper interval between the First and Second Reading in order to prepare yourselves for the discussion of a Bill that is not yet printed or delivered to this House? I presume that next week would be the earliest time at which the House would be able to discuss the Bill to advantage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02021"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am to a great extent in the hands of the House in this matter. The day which I should naturally have suggested for the Second Reading is Monday, but that has already been occupied for some time by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, and I do not know whether he will be disposed to give up his day. I confess I should be sorry to postpone it too long, and although the Bill is not printed I think the terms are familiar to every one in the House. Therefore that argument of my noble friend is perhaps not so strong as it might have been in another case. Perhaps the noble Marquess opposite will tell us what his friends' views are with regard to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02022"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I want to press my question. There has been a good deal of rather slippery work going on during the past week. I do not in the least accuse my noble friend or any of his colleagues of being participants. What we were last told was that the Dissolution would be so announced that we would not have an opportunity of proceeding with the business of this House. Am I to understand that my noble friend guarantees that he will take the Second Reading some day next week?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02023"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes; or this week if the noble Earl prefers it.</membercontribution></p>
<col>698</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02024"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl used some rather misty expressions as to what the House of Lords were going to do with regard to this Bill. Are we to discuss it but in no respect to modify it? Is it to be, so to speak, an academic debate on the propositions of the Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02025"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The Bill will be subject, like all other Bills, to a First Reading and a Second Reading, and I assume it will either be passed or rejected on Second Reading. I thought it courteous to explain to the House that our position was that we were willing and anxious to put the Bill down for discussion by your Lordships, but that we were not prepared to accept any Amendments to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02026"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: Now at last we have got to the point. I beg to give notice that to-morrow I will ask your Lordships to consider the Resolutions that are now on the Paper. I wish to be perfectly candid. I consider that this House, and the country as well, stand in one of the gravest positions in which they have ever been placed, whether by a Government or by their own action or by their own inaction. I am not for one moment disposed to take this debate out of the serene atmosphere in which it has been involved by my two noble friends, and which I think is suitable to such an occasion. I am equally not prepared to admit the proposition that my noble friend has laid down with regard to this matter of House of Lords reform. He says that we have done nothing. We had a long and laborious Committee&#x2014;that was a great step in advance&#x2014;in which, if you remember, in order to facilitate the work of reform to which the Liberal Party was pledged, they took no part. Then we had the Resolutions, which were based largely on the Report of that Committee, Resolutions which do not, in my opinion, go so far its I could wish, but which at any rate represent very substantially the united views on this side of the House and perhaps to some extent on the other. We thought we had the whole session to deal with these Resolutions, and I confess I thought that after the capital Resolution with regard to the hereditary principle had been passed by this House it was our duty not to proceed too hastily with the Resolutions embodying the plan, but that we might wait a month before asking the House to resume the discussion. In that time the event to which my noble
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0354"/>
<col>699</col>
friend alluded took place and changed the whole political situation.<lb/>
A Conference was arranged for&#x2014;I think a wise proposition, a conciliatory proposition, and one from which some entertained hopes. but as to which I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart I never entertained the slightest vestige of hope from its commencement to its termination. But, however that may be, we may thank the Conference for the blessed calm it gave us for four too short months, for having established the principle of conference which may be developed very advantageously in more favourable circumstances. We have to recognise that the meeting of these eight leaders round a table to discuss as statesmen and not as politicians the problem before them was a great gain to the Constitutional procedure of the country. But in order to obtain that Conference and put it in order one thing had to be done, and that was that all contentious business, all business that seemed to be in any degree concerned with that with which the Conference was concerned, had for the moment to be laid aside. I do not know whether I can contradict my noble friend when he says I received no invitation from the other side to abandon my Resolutions. I did not need any invitation. It was in the air&#x2014;it was part of the whole system of mutual conciliation which was to reign on both sides of the House and in both Houses of Parliament that these Resolutions for the moment should be dropped. But at the time they were postponed my noble friend gave a most explicit promise, I am sure in perfect good faith, that my Resolutions, or the Resolutions in my name, should always have precedence of the Resolutions of the Government on the same subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02027"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl give me the reference? My impression is that it was in the month of April that I told the noble Earl that it would be reasonable in the circumstances for the discussion of his Resolutions to have precedence. As he put them down first in this House that seemed only reasonable, but I do not think the noble Earl will go so far as to say that that was a promise that was to hold good for the term of our natural lives. If so, by the simple expedient of postponing his Resolutions he might in that case have prevented ours from having been brought in at all. I am bound to say that it seems
<col>700</col>
to me that the death of his late Majesty and the Conference so entirely altered the situation that I do not consider myself bound by that statement now or in any way inhibited from introducing the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02028"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree that my noble friend's promise was given in April, and I earnestly and fervently hope that his natural life will be prolonged far beyond that of the promise, which has apparently already ceased to exist. But I cannot admit that the demise of the Crown passes a wet sponge over all that has passed previously in regard to this matter. The demise of the Crown and the accession of a new Sovereign bad a great deal to do with the setting up of the Conference; but I cannot admit that it interfered with the promise in regard to the precedence of my Resolutions over the Government's Resolutions when they are brought forward. I should have liked a more public and an earlier announcement of that fact; then I might have taken my measures accordingly.<lb/>
I do not know that there is anything in the pledge of my noble friend that calls for further comment from me, for I do not wish to say anything too polemical on this occasion; but I think there is something almost comical, if it were not tragic, in the fact that a Government which has a majority of 100, more or less, should find itself unable to deal with a question of this kind, and should be obliged to recur to the sense of the country in a manner which certainly indicates a wish not to prolong the discussions in this House on that subject. You have a Parliament eleven months old. You are going to the country presumably. In what way will the new Parliament which is to be elected be more able to deal with the question than the old? You say that the Conference broke up with an impression that if eight such men could not settle the question it could not be settled at all by any such means. What are the special means by which in a new Parliament you would propose to deal with the question which you have found insoluble in the present? But that again is leading me beyond my subject.<lb/>
I do propose&#x2014;and I hope I may claim the support of my noble friends behind me in that procedure&#x2014;I do propose to proceed
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0355"/>
<col>701</col>
with my Resolutions to-morrow night and to sit upon them as long as the House will permit me. I think it of the highest importance to the character of this House, to its reputation in the country, nay, to its very existence as a House, that it should. rest not merely on the declarations of any political party which is willing to undertake the reform of the House, but on the affirmation and the seal of the sincerity of the House itself,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02029"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether the noble Earl will expect me to say anything as to the manner in which action will be taken upon his proposal I understand his proposal to be that the Bill will be produced at once and read the first time in your Lordships' House, and that the date for its Second Reading should be settled hereafter. I do not know whether the noble Earl expects me to be very profuse in my thanks for the manner in which he has met the invitation which I put upon the Paper; but I take note that the noble Earl explained that, although we were to have the Bill in this House, it would be on the distinct understanding that no alternatives were to be discussed and that this House was to be expected to take or leave the Bill as it stood. If the noble Earl will recall the observations which I made earlier in the evening he will remember that my principal reason for desiring that the Bill should come to this House was that I thought we might have opportunities of putting before His Majesty's Government proposals of our own which might have the effect, from our point of view, of greatly improving and adding to the efficiency of the measure. If no such suggestions are even to be entertained&#x2014;and that, I think, was the effect of the noble Earl's intimation&#x2014;I do not know that any very great advantage will result from the discussion of the Bill itself. But upon that point I desire, if the noble Earl will permit me, to confer with my friends, and I will communicate to him the result of my inquiries. There is only one other point which I desire to touch upon. We are given to understand that on Friday the Prime Minister will make a most important announcement to the other House and to the country as to the intentions of His Majesty's Government. I should have thought that it was not very easy for your Lordships to decide what course you would take in view of the noble Earl's offer until we have been made aware of the nature of the announcement to be made by the Prime Minister</membercontribution></p>
<col>702</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02030"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I might explain, in reply to the noble Marquess, in regard to the manner in which the Parliament Bill would be treated in this House, as to which I understood both my noble friend and the noble Marquess seemed to complain. What I said was that, of course, in the discussion of a measure of that kind it is open to anybody to present any number of alternatives in the course of debate; but I did not wish to put ourselves in a position which would enable the noble Marquess to say:&#x2014;" Oh, you never told us that the introduction of this Bill is not a new attempt to arrive at an agreement by settlement." I thought it better to explain that, in our opinion, agreement by arrangement in the course of discussion in this House is no longer a feasible thing. I did not go further than that. I do not desire to limit discussion. If I had that desire I could not carry it into effect. I merely desired to give an intimation of the views which His Majesty's Government hold on the whole subject.<lb/>
As regards the day when the Bill will be taken, that is, of course, very much a matter for noble Lords opposite to decide. It is for them to consider what amount of discussion, in their opinion, such a measure requires. Some of our measures, very much longer than this, have had very short shrift indeed, and whether your Lordships desire to devote to this Bill hours or days, or, if you have them, weeks, I do not know. Nor do I know whether your Lordships are so enamoured of the proposals of my noble friend on the Cross Bench that you desire to go on discussing his Resolutions, possibly up to Christmas, before the Parliament Bill is brought in at all. I suppose we shall be enlightened on these matters on Thursday or on Friday, if we sit on that day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02031"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one point which has been hinted at but I do not think has been made quite as distinct as it ought to have been in either of the two speeches of the noble Earl the Leader of the House. We have been told that the Parliament Bill will be put down for Second Reading, and then, if I understood the noble Earl, in the first of his speeches he said what most of us could. have guessed, that the Bill could be either accepted or rejected. That is usual on a Motion for Second Reading. What
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0356"/>
<col>703</col>
I want to understand is, supposing&#x2014;it is a pure supposition&#x2014;I am not entitled to speak for anybody but myself&#x2014;supposing the House were to pass the Motion for Second Reading and desired to discuss the Bill in Committee, are we to understand that the Government will take part in those discussions with the idea of coming to a solution of the very important matters with which the Bill deals, or do I rightly gather that if the House chose to discuss the proposals it might do so to suit itself, but that the Government attitude is, as the old phrase used to go, "the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill"? It seems to me that if we are to go into Committee, if we are to have discussions upon the Bill, propounded really for discussion, it follows, as a matter of common courtesy as well as of ordinary practice, that the discussion of the Bill through all its stages must be a reality, a genuine discussion with a view of settling how far there is difference between the two sides of the House. It is all very well for the noble Earl to say that you may throw out this or that suggestion; but the real test in a matter of this kind is the phraseology of a particular Amendment put down in Committee.<lb/>
I do not want to widen the area of controversy, but there may be some of us who think that if the Bill were to pass as it stands the whole idea of a practical, useful Second Chamber would be impossible, because there would be no power to ensure that the Court of Appeal would be other than the same as the Court of First Instance, and one of the most cardinal points in this matter is&#x2014;Is the other place to be supreme, or are both Houses to acknowledge that we have in the country at large masters to whose orders we are to pay due respect? That seems to me to be one of the most crucial points in the whole discussion. For my own part I think the matter of so great importance that no length of time spent in debating it in Parliament would be lost, if for no other reason than that it would have an educative effect on the country at large. It seems to me to be contemplated that we are to be, if I may say so, unfairly treated in being burked of discussion.<lb/>
I do not think the noble Earl on the Cross Bench could have gone on with his Resolutions while the Conference was
<col>704</col>
sitting. If I may say so, I think those of us who were not members of the Conference &#x2014;and we could not all be&#x2014;have been very unfairly treated in this respect, that we have no authentic account of what it was that caused the break up. Perhaps it was a matter of agreement that we should not be told; but if it is to be the effect that not only are we not to be told, but because in a secret conclave a failure to agree has occurred therefore all of us are to be deprived of any opportunity of discussion such as certainly we expected to have when the Conference was set up, then I venture to say that if we had had the slightest indication that the mere fact that the failure of the Conference, from whatever cause, was to preclude any discussion in Parliament we would never have been parties to the departure from the ordinary practice of Parliament of discussing these important issues. I cannot say I am converted by what time noble Earl has said; and I ask whether if we proceed to the Second Reading of this Bill it will be for the purpose of intelligent and real consideration of it in Committee, because some of us want to know whether the Government as a whole are going to commit themselves in principle to the utility of a Second Chamber or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02032"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: May I add a single word to what my noble friend Lord Balfour has so well said? I merely wish to ask a question for the purpose of clearing up the matter in my own mind. As I understand, the Bill is to be discussed on the Second Reading. Now, supposing the result of that discussion to be that the Bill is read a second time and sent to a Committee; is there to be a real discussion in Committee? Are the Government not prepared to accept any Amendment? If they are not prepared to accept any Amendment then to call the Committee stage a discussion would be a farce. If the Government say they will not accept any Amendment whatever, the Government attitude will be from the very first a <i>non possumus</i> attitude. Therefore it will really be a sham and an absurdity to attempt to proceed with the Bill on those conditions. I ask this definite question&#x2014;Supposing this House goes into Committee on their Bill, will the Government be open to accept any Amendment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02033"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: With regard to the question put to me by Lord Balfour
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0357"/>
<col>705</col>
and in a somewhat extended form by my noble friend opposite, I should greatly prefer to answer the question definitely when the occasion arises. All I can say now is&#x2014;and it was only out of courtesy to the House that I mentioned the matter at all to-day, because I could quite well have deferred it until the Second Reading&#x2014;in the view of the Government there is no hope of coming to any kind of arrangement on this Bill by any modification of the Bill. From that we draw the conclusion, with which I understand the noble Earl agrees, that the discussion of the details would amount to a waste of time. In our view it is too late for a discussion of that kind, and although, of course, it might conceivably take place, it would be a pure waste of time. But as regards what would happen it your Lordships were kind enough to read the Bill a second time, perhaps I may be allowed to defer answering that question until you do.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PAYMENT OF RATES BY INSTALMENTS<lb/> (SCOTLAND) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02048" align="center">[SECOND READING.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02049">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02050"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those of your Lordships who take an interest in Scottish questions may remember that in July last I introduced into this House, and your Lordships were good enough to give it a Second Reading, a Bill called the Small Dwelling-houses in Burghs Letting (Scotland) Bill. That Bill contained and was limited to certain conditions in connection with the letting and the hiring of small houses. The term "small dwelling-house" was construed in the Bill, but I may observe that the small letting house as defined by the Bill in some cases rose to be a dwelling-house paying a rent up to &#x00A3;21. I took the opportunity on that occasion to point out to your Lordships that it would be desirable, and indeed necessary, to introduce another Bill legalising the collection of the rates at shorter periods than were allowed by the law at the existing time. I then said that the arrangements in connection with that matter were not finally complete, and that I would bring the Bill before this House in a separate form, and I undertook that I would not press the Small Dwelling-houses Letting Bill until I had introduced the other measure. This Bill, the Second Reading of which I am moving this evening, is the performance of my promise.<lb/>
This Bill deals with the collection of rates and with the collection of rates only, except in one very small instance which I will mention to your Lordships presently, as distinct from a system of rates. It does not in any way institute a system of rates, but it alters the mode and the times at which rates may be collected. I am very anxious not to lose your Lordships' time, but I think I may now go through the clauses of the Bill in detail. The Bill authorises town councils and parish councils of burghal parishes to collect rates by instalments. If your Lordships will take Clause 1, you will see that the Bill is permissive. The clause provides that any council may, by resolution passed net later than May 15 in any year, determine that the rates shall be payable by the person or persons liable therefor by instalments. It then proceeds to say that the dates on
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0359"/>
<col>709</col>
which the instalments are to be payable shall be specified in the resolution, and that the resolution is to be published twice in one or more newspapers circulating in the district. Clause 2 says that when a council has passed such a resolution, all powers, rights, and remedies of the council and its officers for levying and recovering the rates shall apply to every instalment thereof.<lb/>
Then in Clause 3&#x2014;and this is the infinitesimal way in winch rates are interfered with&#x2014;it is provided that any instalment of rates made payable by any such resolution upon a date occurring after May 15 in any year and before the date of imposing the rates of the year front and after the said 15th day of May shall be calculated on the basis of the corresponding rate of the year before. That is to meet a. very simple case, where a house is let within three months after the resolution has been adopted and before the date for imposing the new rate conies into force, which is, I think, a day in August. Then in Clause 4 there is a provision that every occupier of a small dwelling-house shall be liable for the instalments corresponding to the period of his actual Occupancy thereof. That limits the present law, because at the present time the occupier on the assessment roll is liable for the payment of the whole year's rate whether he is in occupation or not. Then in Clause 5 it is provided that the owner is to intimate to the assessor every notice of removal which is given or received by him, and the assessor, upon that, has to amend his assessment roll and take such action as may be necessary to obtain payment of rates. The sixth and last clause says that when any instalment which is recovered relates to more than one rate the amount that is recovered shall be applied rateably. In the interpretation clause the expression small dwelling-house "is defined as having the meaning which is assigned to it in the Small Dwelling-houses in Burghs Letting (Scotland) Act., 1910. I think I have told your Lordships all that there is in the Bill.<lb/>
It may now be desirable that I should point out what is not in the Bill, and what the Bill does not deal with. As I said when I commenced my remarks, this Bill applies to the collection of rates as distinct and separate from a. system of rates. What this Bill does not do is this&#x2014;it does not alter the system of rating, and, moreover,
<col>710</col>
the Bill does not alter the Parliamentary or municipal franchise, as would have been clone by a Bill introduced by the Government last year. That Bill contained a provision which the Government themselves did not originally contemplate, but Which was introduced at the instance of a Labour Member. That provision had nothing whatsoever to do with the purpose of the Bill, which was the letting of small dwelling-houses, but it indirectly affected and altered both the Parliamentary and municipal franchise. I need not repeat what I then said, that if it is desirable to do that it ought to be done by a separate and clear Bill, and not indirectly by words slipped into a Bill which professedly relates to the letting of small dwelling-houses.<lb/>
One word more, and one word only, with regard to the Bill now before your Lordships. This Bill has been considered by the Convention of Royal Burghs, and I presented yesterday a petition from that important body in favour of the Bill. The Convention stated that this Bill if passed into law&#x2014;
<quote>"will confer a great benefit on occupiers of small dwelling-houses in Scottish burghs and on the Scottish burghal rating authorities."</quote>
That is the expression of a body of men who, of course, have a very great interest in, and a very great knowledge of, rating, in burghs in Scotland. Let ale say a word with regard to another important body connected with small houses in Scotland. I refer to house owners and house factors. I have taken means. of ascertaining the opinion of the house owners and house factors of Glasgow, and it is really the City of Glasgow which is more interested in this question of small house letting in Scotland than any other body. The house owners and house factors of Scotland have no objection to this Bill itself. They would have liked to see something inserted which is not in the Bill, and which I regret to say I cannot put into it. What they would have liked to see inserted would have been a clause repealing Sections 345 and 346 of the Burghs Police Act of 1892, which leave it open to the municipal authorities of any burgh which adopts those clauses to transfer from the occupiers to the owners the payment of certain rates. I do not say whether this would or would not he desirable, but I did not think it right&#x2014;and I do not think that this House would approve of such a course&#x2014;to repeal in it Bill of this sort powers which have been given to a muni-

cipal authority. I think I have stated everything which it is necessary that I should tell your Lordships, and I would simply move that the Bill be now read a second time. Your Lordships will see that, from my point of view, you have the whole of this question before you. It is contained in these two Bills, and the one Bill has reference to the other.</membercontribution></p>

This is another stage in a somewhat prolonged discussion which, by your Lordships' indulgence, took place last. year on the occasion of the Government Bill dealing with this subject being laid before this House. The noble Earl has, in redeeming his promise to lay his second Bill before the House, completed his scheme, but it is hardly possible, I think, for your Lordships to consider the whole scheme while considering the Second Reading of this particular Bill. The Government scheme does seem to me preferable&#x2014;that your Lordships should see in one Bill the whole scheme of legislation which is to be applied to this particular question. The noble Earl does not put this Bill forward on its merits. He puts it forward as a part of this larger scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02053"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Lord's pardon. I do put it forward on its merits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02054"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: There is something, no doubt, to be said. for a more frequent payment of rates, especially in the case of working men, who do find the payment of rates annually in one sum an onerous obligation. It would be convenient to them to pay their rates more frequently in many cases; but, as I ventured to suggest just now, while the noble Earl puts this forward on its merits, it is not possible for your Lordships to consider it on its merits. It can only be considered with relation to the rest of the noble Earl's scheme, and when I come to so consider it I find it altogether wanting. It is more than doubtful whether it would meet his purpose. It is more than doubtful whether it would
<col>712</col>
succeed in coupling satisfactorily to a system of short lets of working-class houses in Scotland a new system of more frequent collection of rates. The Government put forward their own scheme, and I am always reminded of it when the noble Earl mentions to the House how many voluntary associations and other bodies are in favour of his proposals. He mentioned the Convention of Royal Burghs and other voluntary associations whom I have no doubt at great pains lie has consulted on this question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02055"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I did not consult them at all. They considered the matter themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02056"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I gathered that it was in harmony with advice from various directions that the noble Earl had produced his scheme. If that is not so, it completely accounts for the noble Earl's entire failure to meet public opinion in this matter in Scotland. His Bills do provide a complete scheme, but, so far as I am able to ascertain&#x2014;and I have made every effort to ascertain it&#x2014;public opinion in Scotland does not lend the slightest real support to the noble Earl's solution of this question. The scheme proposed by the Government last year came up to your Lordships' House, not only on the first occasion but on subsequent occasions, with the almost unanimous support of the representatives of public opinion in another place from Scotland, and it will always be to me a great regret that your Lordships did not see fit to adopt the Government's solution of this question. It is obvious that nothing will be gained by dividing against this Bill, so I will content myself with registering on the part of the Government their opinion that it does not provide a workable solution of this question.</membercontribution></p>

Discussions have taken place, and I saw that a discussion took place in the Parliamentary Committee of the municipality of Dundee, and that Committee thought this was a good and workable proposal. On the other hand, the noble Lord tells us that he has taken great pains to ascertain what is public opinion in Scotland, and that he has satisfied himself that public opinion is dead against this Bill. I wish the noble Lord would give us some indication as to how he has got at this public opinion. That is a form of argument which the noble Lord very frequently adopts. He says "I know the facts"; but he does not tell us what the facts are, or the sources from which he derives his facts. I have presented this scheme. The noble Lord says it is a bad scheme. At all events, he has said nothing to show why it is a bad scheme; and as the noble Lord does not think it necessary to say anything more or to give us any definite information, I must certainly ask your Lordships to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02065"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member> rose to move the following Resolutions standing in his name&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. That in future the House of Lords shall consist of Lords of Parliament:</li>
<ol>
<li>A. Chosen by the whole body of hereditary Peers front among themselves and. by nomination by the CROWN.</li>
<li>B. Sitting by virtue of offices and of qualifications held by them.</li>
<li>C. Chosen from outside.</li>
</ol>
<li>2. That the term of tenure for all Lords of Parliament shall be the same, except in the case of those who sit <i>ex-officio,</i> who would sit so long as they held the office for which they sit,</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02066">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in bringing these Resolutions before your Lordships' House, I propose to occupy your time for only a few minutes. I have already occupied your time much too often and at much too great length on this subject; and I have, indeed, said all I have to say&#x2014;an excellent reason for not continuing to inflict any further remarks on your Lordships. Secondly, of course, our time is short. I must also apologise to noble Lords for not having been able to give them longer notice of Resolutions which so materially affect their House. That, again, is not my fault. Time is short. You may have no other opportunity after to-night of discussing these or any other Resolutions affecting the future of this House. That was made clear, ii it was not clear before, by what fell from my noble friend opposite last night.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02067">My noble friend the noble Marquess behind me had challenged the Government
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0362"/>
<col>715</col>
to produce their Bill, their Parliament Bill as it is called. With almost unexpected readiness my noble friend opposite expressed his willingness to take the First Reading of the Bill last night, and he also intimated his willingness to take the. Second Reading not long hence; but when he proceeded to the touchstone of Committee, the case seemed less simple. I cannot help thinking that my noble. friend Lord Lansdowne had it in his mind to introduce Amendments in Committee which might aid the cause of the reform of this House from within this House; but it was quite clear from what my noble friend opposite said last night that such a course will not be possible. Indeed, from the first I did not see how it could he possible, because it is obvious that any amendment in the sense of reform would be almost vital to the principle of the Government Bill; and that the carrying of such an Amendment would be a signal for the withdrawal of that Bill, and so for the closure of any further discussion of the kind we desire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02068">That, I think, shows that you will have no other opportunity than that which is given by these Resolutions before the termination of this Parliament for the discussion of your own reform, and I am bound to say that I gave notice for the day following yesterday because I am not willing to run the risk of what Party exigencies may dictate in the way of a hurried closure of our Parliamentary proceedings. I felt that a bird in the hand was worth two Parliament Bills in the hush, and I thought that your Lordships would concur with me in thinking that it was better to proceed without a moment's delay in the prosecution of these Resolutions, the consideration of which suffered so lamentable an interruption by the death of his late Majesty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02069">Let me say one word more about the Conference to accentuate what was so well said by my noble friend Lord Balfour last night,. which I meant to have said myself, but from which I was rather put off by a prolonged interruption by my noble friend opposite. Had we understood when the truce of God was announced in the name of the Conference that it meant that those who are interested in the reform of the House of Lords could not for a moment consider the suspension of their projects of reform&#x2014;if we had understood
<col>716</col>
 that the Conference meant this, not that eight leading men were to consider in a room without prejudice to other considerations or to the future what was the best way of settling this great Constitutional issue, well and good. But had we understood that what was meant was this, that the Conference meets to-morrow, and that from that day all discussion is to be suspended till the Conference is ended, and that all discussion is to be burled and at an end, then I am certain we should have taken a very different view. This may be the last day which we may have to discuss the matter. I have no conception of what may be announced to us at noon to-morrow, but I think we shall all feel that we shall be in a more satisfactory- frame of mind as Peers interested in the future of the Second Chamber if we can listen to that discourse at noon to-morrow, whatever it may contain, with the feeling that these Resolutions have passed your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02070">Now I propose to move this first Resolution as a whole. I suppose that some discussion will follow upon it, and I see that some Amendments, one of which I have had private notice, will be moved. But I must, before I go any further, and I have little further to go&#x2014;I must proceed to discuss one objection which was raised very formally by my noble friend opposite with regard to these Resolutions. It was that they did not embody a plan. He said these are merely vague principles&#x2014;he will forgive me if I am misquoting his sense&#x2014;and the whole gist of the matter lies in their application. I venture to say that he will find no sound foundation to his proposition that it is the function of an Opposition in a great minority in the other House to formulate a Bill on a great Constitutional question. I venture to say he will find no sound foundation for that proposition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02071">I will venture to remind him and his neighbour, my friend the President of the Council, of the very strong doctrine that was always laid down on that point by Mr. Gladstone. I have not had time to verify the reference, because there has only been a crowded hour or two between last night and to-night. But I am strongly under the impression that, when he moved his Irish Church Resolutions in 1868, he laid the doctrine clown with great positiveness that it was not the duty of even the Leader of the Opposition to formulate a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0363"/>
<col>717</col>
plan in a Bill, that he could only proceed by Resolution, and that the function of producing a. detailed plan on any such question. as that could only belong to the Government in possession of office. It was obvious that if Mr. Gladstone thought otherwise on that great occasion, he would have proceeded by Bill. It is quite true that he did produce a Suspensory Bill on that occasion, but that was not a plan for 0.e:Aing with the Irish Church. It was only an intimation by legislation, which was rejected in this House, of the intention of the Opposition, if returned to power, to proceed drastically and at once with the case of the Irish Church.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02072">But as regards the choice between resolution and plan, I venture to say Mr. Gladstone would not for one moment have listened to any proposition for proceeding by Bill from the Opposition Benches on such an occasion as that. I venture to say that, in the position of the Opposition. it would be an act of great presumption on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to produce a Bill containing a detailed plan for a reform of this House. when he would know that he had no possible chance or hope of carrying it through the other 'House of Parliament, and therefore he could only propose it as a sort of airship, to float over to the other House of Parliament and then be lost in the mist of legislation. But if it would be a great piece of presumption, as I think it would, on the part. of my noble friend the noble Marquess, it would be an infinitely greater piece of presumption for any private member in this House or in the other to attempt to do what not even the Leader of a Party ought to think of doing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02073">The Resolutions, I venture to say, are not. so unpractical as to prevent the production of a definite plan for the consideration of this House. They are in effect Resolutions intimating the readiness and desire of this House to co-operate in the task of its own reform on the basis of these Resolutions and to support any plan brought forward by a Government proposing a. reform of the House on such a. scheme as this. They are ready and willing to support, as I hope, and as I think from all the indications I have seen, such general principles as these for the reform o this House, because they see that on such principles as these you can reform tae House of Lords, you can, too, to a large extent solve this great Constitutional problem, you can maintain the ancient Constitution of this
<col>718</col>
country, and you can do it without all the convulsions incident to a reform carried on by continuous General Elections and the agitation that, in the midst of the labour convulsion and with all the troubles with which our country is harassed at this moment, such a cow se cannot fail to produce. I do not say that these propositions are impeccable, but I think they are large, I think they are comprehensive, and I think they allow so much latitude that they could not unduly fetter the discretion of a. Government which had to legislate upon them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02074">My noble friend the Leader of the House rather reproached us last night for not having introduced the various proportions of which these various elements should consist in any reformed House of Lords. But, my Lords, there is no question of doing anything of the kind. If there was any question of doing that, that would be exactly producing the plan which, I say, it is not our function to do. If, as he says, the numbers, the proportions, are of the essence of the scheme, to produce those numbers and proportions would simply be the expression of an individual opinion on my part, which would only lead to protracted discussion and which could have no practical effect on the issue, whatever that issue may be.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02075">As we proceed in discussion I have no doubt we shall have various points raised with regard to the inclusion of other elements, large or small, on different bases. I do not propose to trouble you with those points at this juncture, but I do venture to point out that, however far these Resolutions may go, they only go part of the way to solving the great Constitutional problem which is before us. The other part of the problem, which is distinct from this, but which is of no less importance, is how to settle the differences between the two Houses, when they occur, so that the Liberal Party when in office shall not be placed at an unfair disadvantage as compared with the Conservative Party, which is usually predominant in this House. It we are spared, to use a colloquial expression. the exploration of that subject may furnish a very useful topic for examination in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02076">I myself endeavoured to persuade the Committee of your Lordships' House, but in vain, and perhaps rightly in vain, to adopt a paragraph in their Report recommending that, n cases of differences
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0364"/>
<col>719</col>
between the two Houses, there should be, as now, a Conference, only a Conference conducted on different principles from those now prevailing, followed, in the case of acute difference, by a Referendum. And I myself do not doubt that it is on that basis that this question must ultimately be settled. But that is far too great for this occasion as it seemed to be too great for the consideration of our Committee, and I only venture to indicate it as showing that those who wish to reform this House are by no means under the impression that their task would be ended if they could prevail in carrying these Resolutions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02077">But, at any rate, my Lords, we at least know this. Noble Lords behind me have, I think, learned something from the experience of some years past. I think there is hardly an individual in this House who is not convinced of the necessity of reform. What is more, I do not believe that, there is one single man in this House. whether he sits on the Treasury Bench or not&#x2014;I do not believe there is a reasoning man outside this House who believes that there is any choice whatever between a reformed House of Lords, whatever shape it may take, and the intolerable tyranny of a Single Chamber.</p>

I admit that where popular election consecrates the age of a representative there is a difference, but if we once begin to go into questions of detail like this we shall never come to an end, though I feel sure that, if any measure is brought forward dealing practically with this matter, my noble friend will meet with the greatest sympathy in his effort to keep the age of a mature and mellow description.

It seems to me very undesirable that this discussion should dwindle away into the examination of petty details. Great and momentous proposals are put before us, and surely there must be many of your Lordships willing and anxious to discuss the subject on its larger lines before embarking on the minor ramifications opened in this direction or that.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0365"/>
<col>721</col>
May I remind. your Lordships of the situation in which we are placed in regard to this question of the reform of the House of Lords? It is now eight months ago since your Lordships passed the first two Resolutions placed on the Paper by the noble Earl, the first declaring the necessity for a Second Chamber in this country, and the second declaring the advisability of reforming and reconstituting this House, and these were passed by your 'Lordships without any division at all. I think it is fair to deduce from that the conclusion that you then accepted the broad general principle of reform. Then there was the third Resolution of the noble Earl, which you will remember was carried by 175 to 17, which declared that the possession of a Peerage should not of itself entitle the holder to sit and vote in your Lordships' House. That was a most grave and momentous decision on your Lordships' part. It was the spontaneous act of this House on the invitation of the noble End, and a voluntary act of self-renunciation without any parallel in the history of any legislative Chamber in any country. I believe that decision produced a profound. impression on the country, because it showed that your Lordships were genuinely in favour of reform, and were willing to waive your Constitutional prerogatives and to leave the ground clear on which, at a subsequent date, there might be erected the superstructure of a reformed House.<lb/>
As representing our side of the House, I should like to emphasise what was said in a passing sentence by the noble Earl. It is purely by accident that we along with himself have been disabled from discussing the matter in the last six months. We were just as willing to pursue the debate as he was to initiate it, and it was merely the lamentable event, to which allusion has more than once been made, that not only threw the whole county into mourning but dislocated the entire proceedings of your Lordships' House. It is not open, therefore, to any one to say, even if he felt inclined to do so, that there is the slightest reluctance on our part to approach these more drastic proposals that are now put before us. On the contrary, this is really the first opportunity that we have had of discussing them, and I hope that now that we do discuss them we shall exhibit a unanimity with regard to them not less than we did to the former proposals. In one respect I venture to suggest that the
<col>722</col>
interval has not been altogether without some compensating advantage. There has been a certain movement and crystallisation of opinion both in this House and outside on the question of House of Lords reform, and I believe we are prepared to come to a decision on these Resolutions to-night with an even greater prospect of unanimity than we might have shown had the matter come before us in the month of March last.<lb/>
I own that I was rather expecting that the noble Earl would explain in some detail the operation of each branch of these Resolutions. I thought perhaps that he would defend, if defence were needed, each upon its merits and would endeavour to place before your Lordships some sort of idea as to what a reconstituted House of Lords would be if it were reconstituted on these lines. I am not so impertinent as to blame the noble Earl for not pursuing that line of action, but those of us on this side who are deeply interested in reform are bound to put before ourselves the question &#x2014;Here we have an existing Chamber in which we have sat for a less or greater period, which has performed its work with greater or less efficiency in the service of the country, and it is now proposed to replace it by something very different. What is the difference between the two to amount to? In what way will the new Chamber be superior to the old?<lb/>
What is the character of the reformed House we are invited to set up? Perhaps I may endeavour to answer these questions in the way they present themselves to my mind. In the first place, I suppose it is certain that we contemplate a smaller House; I will go further and say a much smaller House than the present one. Our numbers are something in excess of 600 Peers&#x2014;I believe by far the largest Second Chamber in the world. I imagine there can be no reason why the work of this House or of any Second. Chamber should require as many as 600 persons to discharge it. The work could probably be as well clone and the interests in the country which ought to be represented in a Second' Chamber would be as efficiently represented, and the functions of debate and revision which appertain to a Second Chamber would be as faithfully discharged in a House of 300 or 400 members as in one of 600. I am rather frightened of talking about numbers after the warning given by the noble Earl just now, and pray do not
 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0366"/>
<col>723</col>
assume that I am attempting to lay down details. But while it is unnecessary to be precise about numbers, we shall probably agree that the reformed. House will be a very much smaller body than that to which we now belong.<lb/>
I pass to the second feature of this reformed House. I have reminded your Lordships that you have already agreed that heredity shall not in itself confer a, right to sit in this House, but I imagine that even the most ardent reformer among us, at any rate on this side, would not go so far as to be anxious to dispense with the hereditary element altogether in the composition of this House. This is not the occasion, nor am I the man, to embark on a discussion of the merits or the reverse of the hereditary principle; but even the most advanced reformers, of whom I suppose I am one, would be prepared to contend here or anywhere that that principle has provided, and is still capable of providing, a valuable and steadying influence in the administration of this country, which is precisely what ought to be reflected in the Second Chamber of a Constitutional Government. Again, it is unnecessary to say that those of us who hope to make reform effective realise that that cannot be done by any too drastic or violent rupture with the past.<lb/>
Having conceded that much, let me point out that what these Resolutions mean is this, that hereditary Peers, in so far as they are to be entitled in the future to a seat in this House, would only take it up if they could satisfy the tests either of qualification by office or by election by their fellows. I confess I have always been a great believer in the test of qualification by office, because in this way you both obtain the most eminent men, which after all is your first desideratum, and you adopt a principle easily understood and widely favoured in the country at large. But I have always recognised that if you adopt such a method exclusively, or even too widely, you will run the risk of excluding very valuable elements from this House; and for my own part I think the plan of the election of a certain proportion of the reformed House by Peers themselves is a most just and reasonable plan, not only because it conserves their rights, but because it will be the means of introducing into this House Peers of great weight and influence both in the country and in the
<col>724</col>
 proceedings of this House and in Committees of the House who might never have had the opportunity of satisfying the official qualification test, but are, nevertheless, indispensable to the utility of our proceedings. Therefore, I think we can all agree with the noble Earl when he proposes that the hereditary element in the future shall rest on this double basis. Here again I am rather frightened by what the noble Earl said about numbers, because the question at once arises as to what proportion the hereditary element so constituted should fill in a reformed House of Lords. I have no right to speak on such a matter. but I imagine that the majority of your Lordships would agree that in a reformed House of Lords the hereditary element should not exercise a preponderant or predominating influence, whatever may be the exact numerical proportion given to it.<lb/>
Then we come to the remainder of the reconstituted House. Now, what is the object which most of us, at any rate, have in view in dealing with the remainder of a reformed House of Lords? I imagine that we have two things we desire to effect. The first is that we want to rest this Chamber to a greater degree than at present upon a democratic basis. By that I mean that we want not merely to obtain for it the support and confidence of the democracy at large, but to connect it in some manner, if it be possible, with the democracy by direct and living ties. The second object, I imagine, is this. It was stated by the noble Earl that we desire a majority in the House of Commons, 'whatever it be, to have a greater opportunity of influencing the decisions and affecting the policy of your Lordships' House than it is sometimes able to acquire under the existing system. It seems to me that both of these objects are provided for by the Resolutions of the noble Earl. He has not, it is true, explained to us exactly what he means by the word "chosen," but perhaps it was a deliberate abstention on his part. Of course, "chosen" may be held to mean a number of different things. There are some persons no doubt in this House who would hope very much that choice might mean choice by election. I myself am one of that number, and I have no hesitation in saying so because I have never for twenty years wavered in the belief that a portion of your Lordships' House might very desirably and opportunely be recruited
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0367"/>
<col>725</col>
by election from the people. Of course, I do not propose on the present occasion to discuss what might be the method of election, whether it should be direct or indirect, and there may be many here present who, while they may be favourable to choice, may not favour choice by the particular method of election. Personally I feel very strongly that your Lordships' House would have a great opportunity of building itself anew in the confidence and. the esteem of the people if the people felt that they themselves in some manner or another made some direct contribution to our numbers. I think the plan would possess the further advantage, that it would give an opportunity for the currents of public opinion, so frequently changing as they are, to be reflected from time to time by the contributions that would. thus be made to the composition of this House, and also that you might in this way admit to your Lordships' ranks many excellent men who are now debarred from entering this House because they have not the wealth or the ambition or the personal desire to accept an hereditary Peerage.<lb/>
Then the final point of this Resolution I understand to be this, that there is left in the hands of the Crown&#x2014;which, of course, means in the hands of the Crown as advised by the First Minister&#x2014;the power of nominating a certain number of members to the reformed House of Lords. That, I think, is a proposition which we shall have no hesitation in accepting, because it is an obvious method of meeting the charge so frequently brought against your Lordships' Chamber that a Liberal Minister in the House of Commons has not the means of making his preponderating influence there at all adequately reflected in this House except by the expedient&#x2014;an impossible one in many circumstances&#x2014;of creating a number of hereditary Peers.<lb/>
The sketch which I have ventured to give is a general idea of the House of Lords reformed upon the lines of the Resolutions submitted by the noble Earl. We should have a smaller House than at present; we should have a House which would not be hereditary in its composition; we should have a House the hereditary element in which would only come here if it were supported by the tests either of official service or of election by their fellows. We should hive a House which contained elements directly reflecting the political
<col>726</col>
opinions of the Government in a majority in the House of Commons, and we. Should have a House if the word "chosen" is liberally interpreted and is taken to include election, which contained a democratic element replenished front time to time by contact, direct or indirect, with the people.<lb/>
The noble Earl, if I may venture to say so, made one very wise proviso in the latter part of his speech. He said, "Do not let it be imagined that the acceptance of these Resolutions&#x2014;the construction of a reformed Chamber based upon these lines&#x2014;solves the whole question." I am sure I may say, on behalf of all of us who sit on these Benches, that we cordially endorse that proposition. The reform of the House of Lords is not the whole of the question. It is a branch of the question which we are specially concerned to take up because there is nobody else to do it. It is openly and almost shamelessly repudiated by noble Lords opposite. But do not let that blind us to the fact that there are other aspects of the case scarcely less important. There is the question which was suggested by the noble Earl of the solution of the difficulties that have occurred in the past and which are likely under any system to occur from time to time in the future between the two branches of the Legislature, whether they be differences with regard to ordinary Bills or to 'Finance Bills, or great measures of organic change. The present is obviously not the occasion upon which those considerations can be properly examined. They are not germane to this discussion, and I imagine that next week, when we shall have the Government Bill before us, it will be open to the noble Marquess and others on this side of the House to state clearly to the House what are our views on this question.<lb/>
To-night we have to confine ourselves solely to time relatively limited question of reform, and to give our votes upon that alone. What the immediate future may have in store for us in the way of reform none of us know, and His Majesty's Government have so far not vouchsafed us any information. I am afraid that in the task of reform to which I hope we shall unflinchingly adhere, we cannot expect much assistance, or indeed any assistance, from them. Reform of the House of Lords has figured in some of the speeches of important members of their Party;
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0368"/>
<col>727</col>
it has appeared in the King's Speech; it has tentatively and timorously obtruded its features from time to time in debates in this House; but whenever we get to business&#x2014;if we form a Committee, the people who openly abstain from it are noble Lords opposite, and if we have a debate in this House the people who decline to take any part in that debate are the noble Lords opposite. It is not for me to reproach them. They have a right to pursue their own policy in the matter, but in proportion as they evade their responsibility the greater is the responsibility which devolves upon us. It places the onus upon our shoulders, and it compels us as a matter of public and patriotic duty to pursue this matter to the end. I hope your Lordships will unanimously carry the Resolutions of the noble Earl, and I believe if you do so you will be placing upon the records of this House and before the country the outlines of a scheme&#x2014;practical, generous, and coherent&#x2014;which are more likely to produce a favourable impression upon moderate men of all classes of the community than are the revolutionary proposals contained in the Bill which is to come before us next week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02085"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I lied not intended to speak this evening, but I desire to ask noble Lords opposite one or two questions. The noble Lord who has just sat down and the, noble Earl who preceded him said they thought it very inadvisable that a Party in Opposition should go into details. In that they are no doubt taking up a perfectly fair and defensible position. The, noble Earl who introduced this Motion quoted the case of Mr. Gladstone and the disestablishment of the Irish Church, and said that Mr. Gladstone when in Opposition merely brought forward general Resolutions and refused to introduce a Bill, But this case, surely, is somewhat different. Noble Lords opposite are producing an alternative plan of policy for the country to consider in opposition to the plan which has been proposed by His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
The first question I wish to put to noble Lords opposite is this. I want to ask them what in their opinion is about the number of Lords of Parliament of which the reformed House of Lords should consist. The noble Lord who has just sat down, presumably speaking for his political
<col>728</col>
friends on the Front Bench opposite, said that the number might possibly be something like 300 or 400, but the noble Lord went on to say that he thought the members of the hereditary Peerage ought not to be allowed to select from among themselves a number sufficient to have a dominating influence. I presume, therefore, that the noble Lord, speaking for the Party opposite, does not intend that in the new House of Lords reformed by himself and his friends the hereditary Peers should be as many as 200. But I think we are entitled to ask something more than that. We are entitled to ask what percentage of hereditary Peers do noble Lords opposite think should be in the reformed House of Lords. Would you have it five per cent., or would you have it forty per cent.? Twenty per cent. might, perhaps, strike people as being something like a reasonable proportion. Yet if you had put twenty per cent. selected on an hereditary basis in the House of Commons, except in the Parliament that was elected in 1910 there would never have been, in my life time at any rate, a single House of Commons in which there would have been a Liberal majority. In other words, if you were to take a popularly elected assembly and put into it twenty per cent. of hereditary Peers, that assembly would practically always have a solid Conservative majority. Therefore, when noble Lords on the other side of the House are laying before the country an alternative plan which they say is to be a fair one as between the two great political Parties, I think we are entitled to ask them this question&#x2014;What percentage of hereditary Peers do you think a fair proportion?<lb/>
There is another question I think they ought to answer. In this plan which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has proposed, do they contemplate or not that the hereditary Peers who are to sit in the reformed Chamber are to be chosen equally from the two political Parties'? If they do propose that, then the elected element, however small it may be, may sometimes have a majority in the new House. If they do not propose that, and if the Peers are to be chosen in the new House from the majority, then practically it will mean that the same Party influences will always control the reformed House as control this House to-day. I do not wish to comment further on the scheme. I merely ask these questions. If they are answered in one way we shall know whether
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0369"/>
<col>729</col>
 the country can consider this an attempt to make a fair scheme as between all political sections of Great Britain. But if we get no answer, people outside will draw their own conclusions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02086"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I must ask the indulgence of the house while I answer at once the question which the noble Lord has put. He said that the scheme which We propose to put before the country is an alternative scheme to that of the Government, and he says it ought to be much more detailed. Speaking in strictly arithmetical mariner, he wants to know what percentage of the hereditary aristocracy is to sit in the future House of Lords, how it is to be chosen, and so forth. I do not wish to argue on that point. I deliberately disclaimed any idea of giving any proportion whatever. But vague as my plan may be, how does it compare with the alternative plan? I, in my turn, will ask a question. My plan is in certain Resolutions, vague though they may be, but giving a general indication of what the composition of the House of Lords of the future may be. how does that compare with the Government plan? The Government plan says:&#x2014;" That, whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of an hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation." and so forth. That is the alternative plan.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, alluded to that, and I hope, therefore, that in asking for some information, which I do in the form of this Amendment, my Amendment may not be considered by the House a petty one. As I read the Resolution it indicates that the selection should be by the whole body of hereditary Peers now in the House of Lords. If that is so, the hereditary Peers in Ireland who do not sit in the House of Lords would be precluded from voting as hereditary Peers. Therefore I should like to ask the noble Earl whether lie means the whole body of hereditary Peers, including the Scottish and Irish Peers who do not sit, in the House of Lords at present.

 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0370"/>
<col>731</col>
he compared the alleged vagueness of his own proposals with the vagueness of the Preamble in the Ministerial Bill. No doubt nothing could be more vague than the latter, and in comparison with it what the noble Earl has to propose is very definite and practical. But I submit that this is really a very unsatisfactory way of dealing with a grave problem. It does not much matter whether the Ministerial plan is or is not vague. You are really asked to consider the means of remodelling the constitution of your House so as to make it more consonant with the force of public opinion outside and to give it a more acceptable position in the national mind, and if you are to pursue that work I think the noble Earl must submit something much more definite and much more practical than what is contained in his Resolutions. It is quite true that in relation to the disestablishment and disendowment of the Irish Church Mr. Gladstone introduced only Resolutions, but in those Resolutions he very clearly indicated the principles upon which he proposed to proceed, indicated them so clearly that a Parliamentary draftsman might have gone a long way towards drafting a Bill to carry out what he desired. But I submit that if a Parliamentary draftsman were given the Resolutions of the noble Earl and asked to construct even an outline of a Bill which would embody them, he would have to give up the task in despair as being beyond his power.<lb/>
Our time, no doubt, is short; the proceedings of this House may be interrupted at a very early period by a Message from the King which will put an end to our deliberations; but if you are going to realise the shortness of time you had better endeavour to make the best use of that time by putting before the country something that will be understood, something that can be studied, discussed, and even determined by the electors who presently may have to go to the poll. But the propositions before us are even more vague than the proposals which were agreed upon by the Select Committee, presided over by the noble Earl, which Committee was not absolutely void of a slight infiltration of members sitting on this side of the House. The noble Lord who spoke from the Front Bench opposite (Lord Curzon), though carefully screening himself from any suggestion that thereby he was questioning the wisdom of the noble
<col>732</col>
Earl on the Cross Benches, did. I think, very good service in giving a definiteness to the proposals before the House which previously they were lacking; but still much remains for explanation.<lb/>
For instance, the interpretation to be given to the word "chosen" is a matter to be carefully considered, and without some explanation on this point it is surely idle to suggest that this scheme is something which can be deliberately considered by the public. The wide range of meaning involved in the use of the word "chosen" might include choice by co-option; that is, bringing in such members as you yourselves would like to have added to your numbers. Such a suggestion is no sooner made than it is dismissed as unsatisfactory. The choice must be by some body other than yourselves. It must in some way be from outside. It must introduce elements of representation which are not now here, and in the absence of those elements we are not capable of making a right choice so as to bring in those members. I do not know whether anybody will venture to suggest an amendment to that word, but unless you do submit some amendment, unless you introduce some explanation that will make matters clearer, you surely must be conscious that you are laying the foundation of a scheme so illusory that it cannot be grasped by any rational mind.<lb/>
I approach this question with a sincere desire to see the solution of a great problem worked out by constitutional means&#x2014;by evolution, not by revolution, by gradual adaptation of new methods to new forms of life, following the great traditions of the past which I still hope may be preserved in the future. But if you are going to enter on a task like that, you must have the courage of your undertaking; you must be clear as to what you desire. Let it be granted that in the reformed House you may get that link between the present and the future which is involved in the presence of a certain number of Lords of Parliament elected by the whole body of the Peerage. In spite of the observations of my noble friend below me, I do not think that that element need be fatal to a composition of the House of Lords that would be approved, or, at all events, that would be accepted, by the people at large. The new House of Lords must be Conservative in its temper, but it may have new elements of life and movement in it which will make it more
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0371"/>
<col>733</col>
accessible to opinions prevailing without, more responsive to national movement, more approximating to another branch of representation and embodiment of the national will.<lb/>
You are to have a certain number elected by the whole body of the Peerage. As the noble Earl said just now, the Select Committee agreed that the election should be made by all Peers, whether of England, Scotland, or Ireland&#x2014;that the distinction of origin of the Peerage should he lost in the election of representative members of the Upper House. It was also agreed that the representation should be so undertaken&#x2014;a really vital point&#x2014;that it should in some measure reflect in the men chosen the composition of the House itself. With regard to nominations by the Crown, there were more distinct and definite recommendations made by the Committee as to who should be eligible and what qualification should be required, which the noble Earl has not thought it convenient to reproduce in the Resolutions before the House. I do not quarrel so much with that, but one of the Resolutions goes on to provide that the members of the reformed House shall all sit on the same term of tenure. I do not know what the noble Earl means by that. The scheme of the Select Committee had much greater variety and elasticity, and there were merits in that variety and elasticity which need not be lost in presenting the scheme to-day. The Lords of Parliament who were to be elected by their fellow Peers were to be elected for a. Parliament; those nominated by the Crown were to be nominated for life. A suggestion has been made in favour of the introduction of a body of elected members from without who should be elected by members of the House of Commons. This suggestion proposed that those members elected should sit for two Parliaments, one-half going out a t the end of each Parliament. So that you would have members elected for one Parliament, members elected for two Parliaments, and members sitting for life, thus giving variety and a new and better character to the reformed House. I do not think myself, short as our time is, that it is too short to discuss principles in the way I have indicated. If it is, indeed, impossible to do so, then we have a good deal to lay to the charge of the Conference.<lb/>
If I may be allowed for a moment to pass from the point immediately at issue, I can-
<col>734</col>
not say that I all agree with the view which is apparently taken by His Majesty's Government that, the Conference having failed to come to a conclusion on this great question, it is idle to pursue it further except by precipitating a General Election. If that is so, the institution of the Conference has been a great derogation of the power, dignity, and I would say the vitality of Parliament. It was understood when the Conference began its sittings, at the instance, I believe, of the Prime Minister, that if it failed we should revert to the <i>status quo ante</i> and go on with the discussion which was interrupted. It is said&#x2014;What is the use of going on if it is found that the foremost men on the Government side of the House and the foremost men on the Opposition side are unable to come to an agreement? I altogether demur to that statement, which appears to me to imply a very shortsighted view of the action of Parliament. Parliament moves in a whirl of public opinion, and the discussions here and elsewhere are continually influenced and penetrated by suggestions from without and by what is going on outside. Because eight men meeting together in a room have endeavoured to pursue their deliberations, in the most friendly way, absolutely by themselves, and have come to no conclusion, it is said that it would be impossible for Parliament, working in the light of public opinion, to arrive at a solution. Well, if I may say so without. offence, that seems to me to imply too great importance in those who constituted that conclave.. Their failure is not to be interpreted as a failure on the part of the nation.<lb/>
From that divergence I come back to-this, that that being so you ought to go on and make use of whatever time you have as if the Conference had not existed If the Conference had not existed you would have gone on with these Resolutions in a businesslike way. The fatal defect of the present proposals is that they are not businesslike, that they are not sound. In the bringing of new elements into this House, to speak of them as "chosen" you are using a word of such terrible ambiguity that it is impossible that it can carry any conviction or assent or the part of those who are really seriously engaged in this discussion. I conclude by saying again that I have taken part in this debate with the sincere desire, if it is possible, to continue it to a conclusion in a constitutional way. I am altogether averse from.

legislation in the streets. I always remember the dying words of Cavour&#x2014;

And so it may be said that any man can legislate in the streets. Instead of that we should have legislation in Parliament, and I deplore the possibility of the premature interruption of the discussion of this question within the walls of Parliament itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02100"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had the pleasure of agreeing with a great deal of what my noble friend Lord Courtney has just said, but, before I pass on to endorse and emphasise the criticisms which he made, I must demur to the criticism that he levelled at the commencement of his speech and in his peroration at the particular form of the Resolution which your Lordships are now discussing. I do not dispute that, in other circumstances, the proposals which we are met to discuss might have been embodied more fully either in Resolutions or in a draft Bill, but the noble Lord entirely forgets the history of the case and why it is that at this moment, when, naturally, your Lordships thought you would have ample time for dealing with this question, the Resolutions have had to be taken as they stood on your Lordships' Paper. Again I dispute the deduction Lord Courtney seemed to make, that there was any ambiguity in the statements of my noble friend Lord Curzon. I associate myself with all that he said. I will summarise it in these words: Selection by the Peers of Peers; chosen by election; nominated by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister for the time being. I maintain that in those three methods&#x2014;selection, election, and nomination&#x2014;you have the materials for a House which will carry on all the traditions of the past and will engraft into it all the forces of the nation and those elements of public opinion which, we recognise, are not here to-day. The reform which we mean is a <i>bona fide</i> reform; we have no mental reservations behind it. In answer to Lord St. Davids I would say we have no intention of swamping the reformed House of Lords by hereditary Peers, and we mean to give the opportunity his Party have claimed for the representation of his Party in this House in such a manner as has never occurred for many a year past. Therefore, although I cannot go fully and in detail to-night into the points
<col>736</col>
raised, I do wish, in the most deliberate manner, to associate myself with what Lord Curzon said, and I recommend the summary I have ventured to give as an accurate description of his meaning.<lb/>
I will now pass to that part of Lord Courtney's speech in which he criticised the Government for the position in which we find ourselves, and I think I shall be accurately representing him when I repeat his own summary&#x2014;that he liked constitutional change by evolution, not by revolution. Last night the Leader of the House expressed opinions in relation to this matter, which, I confess to your Lordships, appeared to me to he fairly amazing. He said&#x2014;and Lord Courtney has already touched on this point&#x2014;that he did not assume but he knew&#x2014;he knew !&#x2014; that, because eight Statesmen had failed in a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to settle this question in secret, it could not be settled in public. Why? You cannot settle this question, forsooth, by adding to eight reasonable men any given number of red-hot Radicals or red-hot Tories. No, my Lords; but is every man even who calls himself a devoted Liberal or a devoted Conservative red-hot on this subject? I very much mistake the condition of public opinion on this matter if I am not correct when I say I believe that on this question the great majority of electors, be they Liberal or Conservative, are detached. They want a settlement, and they know that there is a strong case on the other side as well as on their own. So far from a settlement of this question being impossible by public discussion and the exertion of the influence of the multitudes of our fellow-countrymen and of the Press, I believe the very reverse to be the case.<lb/>
The second statement of the noble Earl the Leader of the House was, I think, more amazing still. I do not think any more remarkable statement, and, if my noble friend will allow me to say so with perfect respect, any statement more absolutely divorced from fact, has ever been made in this House. That is a strong statement, I admit, and I have to justify it. I should explain that I am not questioning a mis-statement of fact, but that the opinion he expressed is further from the truth of what will be than any opinion on a really important matter I have ever heard before in your Lordships' House. Unless I wholly misunderstood the Leader of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0373"/>
<col>737</col>
the House, he said that this question in its main lines could only be settled by one of the Parties of the State. It was to be settled either entirely by his Party or entirely by my Party.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02101"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: What I said was that it would have to be settled in its main lines under the direction of one Party. That is to say, supposing it was settled now it would be settled under your direction. We should greatly prefer to see it settled under our direction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02102"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to read into the noble Earl's words anything lie did not intend to put there. I submit that the country reading his speech as reported. would think, as I thought, that he meant that the attempt to settle this question by agreement and compromise had failed, and that it would only be settled in its main outlines&#x2014;and, after all, it is the main outlines that matter &#x2014; by one Party or the other. I believe that to be absolutely contrary to the facts of the ease. You have in this country art almost equal division of opinion. If you take in the Irish voters, my Party is in a minority of votes, thought not a large one. We know that in Ireland this is not the main issue. In Great Britain the electorate is almost equally divided on this question. I say that it is absolutely impossible for one-half of the electors of Great Britain permanently to coerce the other half in this matter. I say that just as much for my half as I say it for your half. know that this matter cannot be permanently settled as I in my heart of hearts should like to see it settled. Neither, my Lords, can His Majesty's Government and the Party they represent settle the question permanently according to their own ideas only. Supposing that there should be a General Election, and supposing for the sake of my argument that His Majesty's Government arc again returned to power and that by some means or other they embody as part of the Statute law of this country their conception of the proper settlement of this question, is it to be supposed that my Party, and the electors that we represent in the country, will accept that as a final decision? Instead of being the end of this question it will be but the beginning of a most bitter and prolonged Constitutional struggle. We will never sit down under a solution which has been arrived at after ignoring the feelings
<col>738</col>
of half of our fellow-countrymen, and which, rightly or wrongly, but conscientiously, we believe to be absolutely incompatible with the well-being and future greatness of this country. Therefore, my Lords, I most earnestly register my protest against the meaning which I read into the noble Earl's words and which others equally honestly may read into them, although he may not have intended it. I warn hint, as I would warn any of the headstrong of my own Party, if such there be, that this matter can only be finally settled in a way which reasonable men of both Parties will accept, and by the recognition on that side as well as on this that there are two sides to this question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02103"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Earl on the Cross Benches will believe me when I say that on personal grounds, and in a sense on public grounds, I am exceedingly sorry that I shall not be able to support the Resolutions which he has put before us to-night. I say on personal grounds because I had the great pleasure of sitting on the Committee over which he presided, though I think when he addressed us on this same subject in March he said that I came there more or less as a freebooter and an independent; and on public grounds I am sorry I cannot support him because I have now been in this House thirty-three years and I recognise very fully, more fully, perhaps, than a good many who have not been here so long, what a tremendous amount of most valuable attention Lord Rosebery has given to the question of House of Lords reform, and with what sincerity and ability he has always treated the subject.<lb/>
I do not agree with the charge brought against the Resolutions by Lord Courtney, that they are not sufficiently broad or sufficiently precise. Looking at them as an average individual, I should say that the Resolutions are admirably drafted for the noble Earl's purpose. But I decline to support them for very much the same reason that I gave when I six/cc in this House on March 14, when I said that I should not like to mortgage in any way my freedom of action until I had seen the Government Bill. That is one of the reasons why I am not prepared to go into the Resolutions now. I was very glad to hear last night from the noble Marquess opposite that lie found many points in the Government Bill upon
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0374"/>
<col>739</col>
 which he thought noble Lords behind him and himself would be able possibly to meet the Government. He asked for a full discussion and a Second Reading debate on that Bill, and although I was sorry to hear that Lord Crewe was unable to hold out any prospect of representations in Committee being accepted by the Government, yet as a strong House of Lords man, which I have been all my life, I think we shall best get out of our difficulties by trying to turn our minds to the Government Bill, and if it is a question of putting our case before the constituencies, as I apprehend it will have to be put at no distant date, I think our best line is to show to what extent we are prepared as reasonable men to try and meet the Government Bill.<lb/>
I submit that these Resolutions do not touch the difficulty in which the two Houses find themselves. I do not want to go back to ancient history, but I think that within the last four or five years the action of the House of Lords has been a little too muscular. The noble Earl, I believe, put in a proviso, but I understood him generally to say that by adopting these Resolutions we should go a long way towards solving the great constitutional question in which we find ourselves without any violent revolution and without any great breaking off with the traditions of the past. I understood that he meant by that, that the reform of this House as put before the public by the Resolutions would go a very long way to solve the constitutional problem. It might go some way, but I am afraid the only way we can solve the constitutional problem is by finding some readjustment of, to quote the words used by the Leader of the House last night, the House of Lords as we find it now and of the House of Commons as we also find it now. That seems to me the real difficulty, and I do not think these Resolutions, however ably drafted, ably supported, and influentially backed, do anything in that direction. What we have to find is some means by which we can adjust the existing powers of this House to the existing powers of the House of Commons, and I do not think that can be found in these Resolutions.<lb/>
I understood the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, in the interesting speech he delivered earlier in the evening, to say that from the moment these Resolutions
<col>740</col>
came before the House of Lords they had made a profound impression upon the country. His information may be better than mine, but in my opinion the profound impression on the country, not only on our side but on the Conservative side, the profound impression upon the average voter on both sides in this country is not a question of the self-reform of the House of Lords from within, which they look upon as a domestic affair and which an ordinary meeting does not understand&#x2014;the profound impression which at present is resting on the mind of the country is this. They say&#x2014;Here are you, 600 well-educated gentlemen; you see that we want some readjustment of the existing relations of the two Houses, and we expect you to put your mind to that of the Government and see if something of the kind cannot be found. I was very glad that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition urged the full debate of the Parliament Bill. I was equally glad when the noble Earl below me said that sufficient evenings would be found to debate that measure properly. It seems to me that the case for the House of Lords, which I have very much at heart, may be much better put by a full debate on that Bill, the case being put in the form of Amendments in Committee, than by the adoption of these Resolutions to-night. I think that is what the constituencies would understand and what they would expect, and it is for that reason that. I, with great personal regret, shall have to take the same line as I took before. I did not vote before, and I shall not be able to support the Resolutions this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02109"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, unlike the noble Lord opposite, I desire to support the Resolutions which are before the House, and I should like to comment, in the first place, on one somewhat singular fact. What strikes me more than anything else in this debate, or at all events strikes me as much as anything else, is that in the space of about three hours we are apparently about to pronounce a practically unanimous opinion upon questions of the most vital importance. I own that it is almost a surprise to me&#x2014;it is a surprise, in fact&#x2014;to realise the almost passionate desire which apparently exists in your Lordships' House at this moment for reform. It is emerging almost like a subterranean torrent and overwhelming all the Benches on this side of the House, and the only persons who appear to remain untouched and as reactionary as ever are the noble Lords who are members of the Government.<lb/>
There is one thing that can be said about these Resolutions&#x2014;I think it has been said already&#x2014;namely, that nobody can complain that they are not wide and comprehensive. I think it was Frederick the Great who once remarked that any subject in his dominions was at liberty to go to Heaven in the best way he chose. Everybody can put his own interpretation on the words "chosen," "offices," "qualifications," and upon the word "outside." I put exactly the same interpretation upon those words as did my noble friend Lord Curzon. These Resolutions in reality represent roughly what everybody&#x2014;I might almost say every sensible person&#x2014;is agreed upon, but I am afraid I must except front this category the members of the Government, whose clear and avowed object it is to retain this House as a pompous and pretentious place which is to grow constantly in size and the functions of which are to diminish in inverse proportion.<lb/>
Something was said by the noble Lord opposite as to the proposal with reference to the election of Peers by their own numbers. I hope that I shall convince the House of the sincerity of my support
<col>742</col>
of the Resolutions when I announce that, so far as I can see, I personally have no chance whatever of forming part of a reconstituted Assembly. I do not possess the requisite qualifications. Were I to offer myself for election I suspect that the Whips would oppose me, and I am also afraid that there are a number of noble Lords, who, quite erroneously and quite unjustly, probably think that I am in no small degree responsible for their ultimate exclusion. On the whole it seems to me that the best chance that I personally would have of forming part of a reformed House of Lords would be to become a Liberal Peer, in which case I should have no difficulty whatever in attaining my desire, and at the same time I should discover that I possessed innumerable virtues of which at the present time I am unconscious. There are great difficulties in connection with elections of all kinds. I remember many years ago I was in one of the Balkan States at the time of a general election, and an election was a particularly difficult operation to carry on in that country, because hardly anybody could read or write and nobody knew what they had to vote upon. But the difficulty was easily got over. The Government laid hold of all persons they thought might be potential opponents and put them in gaol, and the rest of the population was marched to the polling booths by the police and shown how to vote, and I am not sure that I did not vote myself. I state this to show how easy it is to get over a difficult situation if you put your mind to it.<lb/>
But to put the naked and brutal truth before the House we must admit&#x2014;I, at all events, am ready to admit&#x2014;that the melancholy fact is: a lot of us have got to go. Sentence has been pronounced by several speakers to-night. The only doubt which remains in our minds is as to the number of us who have to be got rid of. If you have to discharge a disagreeable duty of this kind, you ought to make it as easy as possible, and obviously election offers the easiest mode. Theoretically&#x2014;and I hope it may be the case&#x2014;we shall proceed to elect the best, the wisest, and the most respected members of this House; but I rather doubt myself whether we shall attain this ideal standard. I am not at all sure whether each Peer, as the Athenians did on a historical occasion, may vote for himself. That obviously will cause a good
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0376"/>
<col>743</col>
deal of trouble. No doubt everybody will use all possible influence in order to get elected, and female influence would not necessarily be barred. I know that at all events I should do all I could in order to secure my election.<lb/>
It has been pointed out, not so much to-night but on previous occasions, that by this particular method many well-deserving but obscure Peers&#x2014;I apologise for using the word "obscure," perhaps I should rather say lesser-known Peers&#x2014;might find themselves left out. We have heard the complaint made that there are many of these deserving persons who seldom come here but are doing perfectly inestimable work in the country. I hear a responsive echo. Personally I feel some doubt as to the existence of this class. I should like to think of the retired nobleman, blushing unseen, shall we say, in the backwoods, and diffusing a gentle atmosphere of utility and beneficence, but I am not sure that these persons exist in large numbers. What I have observed since I have been in this House is that the Peers who are most prominent here and who do the largest amount of political work are at the same time the persons who do the most work in their own localities. There are several Peers present who afford illustrations of this statement Take, for instance, the case of my noble friend the Duke of Northumberland. Take the case of my noble friend Lord Curzon. I have known him for many years and can safely say that I have never known him idle. Take, again, the case of my noble friend Lord Camperdown, the most frequent attendant here, and one who might almost be said to occupy the position of senior master of the ceremonies of this Assembly. My noble friend is a chairman of a county council and fulfils numerous other offices, and he is in his own person a perfect monument of industry. On the other hand, I doubt whether, even supposing these meritorious persons are excluded, they will be much missed. But the fact is that there is no other way of getting out of the difficulty. Election of this nature may be an unsatisfactory method, but it is the one thing which everybody who has considered the subject has been obliged to fall back upon as the last resource, and I do not know that any better alternative can be produced. It is a thing upon which everybody is practically agreed and which we have got to face.<lb/>
<col>744</col>
As to the relative merits of a House consisting of Peers elected by each other and of Peers who sit by virtue of some qualification or other, I hold the same view as my noble friend Lord Curzon, and I much prefer the latter. I do not wish to detain the House at this moment by expatiating on the superior advantages of qualification. What I desire to point out is that these are the two recognised methods by which everybody who has considered the subject is agreed the new House of Lords should be constituted. As regards the third and most critical proposal in the Resolution, "Peers chosen from outside," here again I take refuge in the word "chosen," and I might also take refuge in the word "outside." This is left judiciously vague, and I do not honestly see that anybody has a right to complain that it is so. It is absurd for people to come here and ask for categorical replies and for figures and facts with regard to the exact constitution of the future House of Lords. All that the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has done&#x2014;and I only wish it had been done earlier&#x2014;is to lay down certain broad principles which, if I am not mistaken, will receive practically the unanimous assent of this House, and will serve for future legislation which will be undertaken by a Government when the opportunity arises. They are the result of the deliberations of persons who have made this particular question a study, and they in all probability provide the best solution of the difficulty with which we are now attempting to deal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02110"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have so often had occasion to trouble your Lordships with an expression of my views on this subject that I am reluctant to say anything more this evening; but the matter is one of immense importance, and I really feel I would be almost disloyal to my noble friend on the Cross Benches if I did not say one word in support of the Resolutions which after many disappointments and many years of laborious work, he will, I hope, convoy safely into port this evening. I will not follow my noble friend behind me into his amusing anticipation of the manner in which these projected reforms are likely to operate; but I will venture to express my entire disagreement with him on one point. He gave us to understand that he doubted extremely whether in the new order of things he would find himself among the survivors of the old House of Lords. I am
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0377"/>
<col>745</col>
not a betting man; if I were I should be in lined to offer my noble friend a small bet that should a reformed House ever come into existence lie would be found a place somewhere or other upon these Benches, and that without recourse to any of those subterranean and insidious influences which he seemed to think would so often be relied upon.<lb/>
I think my noble friend was quite right in suggesting that there was a very general opinion throughout the House that it was absolutely impossible for us to leave the House of Lords untouched and in its present condition, not because I share the feeling that it does its work badly, not because I at all desire to suggest that it has proved itself incompetent. I believe, on the contrary, that it is abundantly competent for the work it has to do. I go further. Having known this House for a great number of years, I believe there never was a moment when there was a larger number of Peers who took a part, and a useful part, in our proceedings. But for reasons with which we are too familiar this House has become absolutely unwieldy in numbers; and I for one am convinced that it will never be allowed to exercise the functions of a properly-constituted Second Chamber unless its constitution is very materially altered.<lb/>
Under the guidance of my noble friend we have travelled a considerable distance. We have already passed his first three Resolutions, the result of which will be that in the reconstituted House we shall have admitted, in the first place, the principle of a large reduction of numbers, and, in the second place, the even more important principle that no Peer will be entitled to sit and vote unless he is able to present some credentials other than the possession of an hereditary Peerage. What are those credentials to be? My noble friend has asked us to consider that point to-night. There are two kinds of credentials which obviously can be resorted to. One of these might be the possession of personal qualifications, while the other might be the election of a Peer by his fellow Peers. I wish to say a word with regard to the question of personal qualifications. I feel, as does my noble friend behind me, that it is a very obvious suggestion to make that Peers who have held high office at home or in the Colonies, men who have, perhaps, ranked high in diplomacy or in other branches of
<col>746</col>
the public service, Peers who have had, let us say, a long and wide Parliamentary experience, or who are honourably connected with the arts and the sciences, that such men as these should be spared the necessity of submitting themselves for election by their fellow Peers, and I am entirely in favour of relying, to a certain extent, at any rate, on qualifications of this kind.<lb/>
But I desire to point out&#x2014;and those noble Lords who sat on the Committee presided over by my noble friend will bear me out&#x2014;that the difficulty of applying this test of official or other qualification is very great indeed. You find yourselves face to face with constantly-recurring puzzles of this kind an ex-Cabinet Minister is to be considered as qualified, is an ex-Under Secretary of State to be qualified? If an ex-Ambassador is qualified, is an ex-Minister qualified? if an officer of the rank of a full General or Admiral is considered to be qualified, what about officers of lower military or naval rank?<lb/>
All these are extremely difficult questions to deal with, and I merely desire to say that in my view, if we are to resort to this test of qualification, it would be desirable that the list of qualifications should be kept very small and within very narrow limits, and that the qualifications should be of the most unimpeachable kind. If you fill up too large a portion of your reformed House of Lords with distinguished veterans, if I may so put it, I doubt extremely whether you will not exclude a number of men who really would be of much better value to this House for the purposes of our every-day legislative and deliberative work. I for one would certainly prefer, if I wished to construct an efficient House of Lords, a pretty liberal contingent of Peers familiar with country life, familiar with the management of landed property and with local and municipal administration, to veterans with a distinguished record who have arrived at a time of life when they look naturally for repose rather than for laborious Parliamentary work.<lb/>
I therefore attach great importance to the presence of a sufficient contingent of Peels elected by their fellow Peers, and I sin under the impression that you could construct a most efficient House of Lords by resorting partly and within moderate limits to the test of qualification and partly
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0378"/>
<col>747</col>
to election by the body of the House. Changes of this kind will have the effect of curing two admitted defects in the present House of Lords&#x2014;the defect of its unwieldiness and the presence of Peers who, for one reason or another, are not able to interest themselves in the way we should wish in our proceedings. But I desire to add that I am as thoroughly convinced as my noble friend (Lord Rosebery) that no reconstruction of the House of Lords within those lines will really meet the necessities of the present case. We have to meet this complaint of the existing House of Lords, that we are out of touch with the country, that we are, as it were, remote from our fellow subjects and irresponsible to them. I have always thought that the complaint was a most unjust one, but we have to deal in these days with sentiment and prejudice, and I think I may add with constant misrepresentation. There are millions of people in this country whom, I believe, you will never convince that hereditary Peers can be trusted with the sole and final arbitrament of our public affairs. Have not your Lordships lately noticed how widely it has been believed throughout the country that the Osborne judgment was the work of the House of Lords which I am now addressing? How are you going to carry conviction to people who are as unfamiliar as that with the real manner in which the business of Parliament is conducted?<lb/>
I say again, I am convinced that your Second Chamber will never be given the place which it ought to occupy in a properly balanced Constitution unless you can find some means of bringing it into closer relation with the democracy. You can do that by allowing one section of the House to be recruited from outside and from any source, either by nomination of the Government of the day or by sonic form of election. I have always attached great importance to nomination by the Government of the day, and I will tell your Lordships why. A Peer nominated by the Government of the day is nominated by an authority which owes its existence to the popular House of Parliament, which, again, owes its existence to the suffrages of the people of this country. A Peer so nominated: has therefore distinctly a democratic title to his seat, and this resort to nomination appears to me to have this particular advantage. It is, moreover, as far as I am aware the only means by which you could make sure of mitigating to some extent the disparity of strength between the two Parties in this House.<lb/>
<col>748</col>
I will explain my meaning. Let us assume that a Liberal Government has the right of appointing five Peers tithing each of its five years of office. When the time came for the Liberal Government to go out of office they would have behind them in this House a residuum of twenty-five Liberal Peers, who would help materially to redress the inequality of strength which now prevails between one side of the House and the other.<lb/>
But I do feel that the country would not be content merely by a step which strengthens this House by adding to it Peers who would be regarded as the nominees of the Government of the day. I may say, therefore, that I am ready with my noble friend to look beyond that, and I should desire to see a certain proportion of the reformed House chosen from outside, and by this I mean elected in some way or other outside this House. I come to that conclusion, I admit, with a great deal of reluctance. I have always thought that heredity and election were not very good bedfellows; and if this change is made I have an idea that those who come after us may see that one of the partners gets rid of the other; and f do not think that the hereditary element is likely to be the predominant partner if that should occur. But I am convinced that we have come to a time when nothing but strong and courageous measures are likely to save this country from the peril in which I believe all our institutions and the Constitution of the country itself stand. I do not hesitate to say that if I am offered, on the one hand, a choice of a policy based on a tender treatment of this House accompanied by the deprivation of those powers which I conceive a Second Chamber ought to possess, and, on the other hand, a policy based on a drastic treatment of this House accompanied by the retention of the full measure of the powers which a Second Chamber ought to enjoy, I should without hesitation prefer the more drastic treatment.<lb/>
I do not trouble your Lordships with any observations upon the question of the numbers in which these different classes might be added to the reformed House. Those are details which, it seems to me, must obviously be left for consideration whenever the subject is dealt with in a Bill. But I wish to take up the challenge which was thrown out by the Leader of the House last night when he told us that
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0379"/>
<col>749</col>
we had left him and his friends entirely in the dark as to our views upon this question of numbers. I think he said he did not know whether, when we talked of reinforcements from outside, we meant only a mere handful or something more than that. I certainly do not mean only a mere handful. I mean that a substantial section of the House should be recruited in this manner, and as I cannot help thinking that in laying these proposals before the country we cannot study simplicity too much I am inclined to say that in my view the reformed House might consist of one-half of hereditary Peers, all of whom would, of course, be either qualified or elected by their fellow Peers, and the other half of men not one of whom would hold his seat in virtue of heredity, and who would be chosen from outside, either by nomination or by some form of election. That is the kind of policy which I understand the noble Earl on the Cross Benches advocates and which I am prepared to support.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite give us to understand that they, too, are House of Lords reformers. I hope when the noble Earl rises he will take up the observations that were made by my noble friend Lord Curzon on that point. Noble Lords opposite have never stirred a finger in the direction of House of Lords reform. They boycotted the Committee presided over by Lord Rosebery. They have up to the present moment boycotted this debate. They mentioned the subject of House of Lords reform in a vague sentence in the last Speech from the Throne delivered by His late Majesty, and they have mentioned it again in an equally vague manner in the Preamble of the Parliament Bill which is to come before us next week. We are sometimes told that our proposals with regard to the House of Lords are of a hazy description. What are we to say of the proposals of noble Lords opposite? It would be a compliment to call them nebulous. I will not trouble your Lordships further. This discussion has been valuable because it has enabled us to estimate what our policy is and what your policy is. Your policy is to encourage the abuse of this House and to belittle it; and having taken away its character to shear it of its powers. Your policy is to set up something which would not be very dissimilar from single-Chamber government&#x2014;government under the despotic
<col>750</col>
control, not so much of the House of Commons, as of the Minister who happens for the moment to control the House of Commons, and of the Parliamentary combination by which that Minister is himself controlled. Between these two policies we have to take our choice. I cannot believe that reasonably-minded people will doubt as to which is the truer and more statesmanlike policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02111"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I may be pardoned if in the few words which I say in reply to the noble Marquess I confine myself to one part of the debate which has been held. I may be excused, I hope, if I do not follow some noble Lords who have spoken into a general discussion upon the political situation as it exists at the present moment &#x2014;I mean, for instance, Lord Courtney and Lord Selborne. Lord Selborne devoted himself with an eloquence warmed by the Southern sun under which he has been winning so much distinction, to an attack upon our policy in regard to the general situation. Although at one moment I thought he was going to say that I ought to be impeached, I trust that he will allow me to say very honestly that I am delighted to see him here once more.<lb/>
My noble friend on the Cross Benches, if he will forgive me for saying so, somewhat over-stated the case when he assumed that I had complained that he had not brought in a Bill. It had never occurred to me that lie would bring in a Bill, and I think I am accurate in saying that I never suggested that he ought to have done so. But I did say that, for the noble Earl's purpose, I thought the Resolutions exceedingly vague in their terms, and I have had some unexpected support in that view. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, proceeded to develop in great detail and in a most interesting speech his view of the way in which the principles enunciated in the Resolutions ought to be carried into effect; but we are none the wiser as to whether those are the views of my noble friend on the Cross Benches, or of a great many other noble Lords who have not taken part in the debate.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, one word on the question of time. It is assumed that this debate has been forced, so to speak, into the last moment. We have spoken all along of the lamentable event which, by causing a cessation of polemics, prevented these Resolutions or any other Resolutions from being discussed during the latter part of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0380"/>
<col>751</col>
the Summer Session. That is perfectly true, but the Committee of my noble friend reported at the beginning of December, 1908, and during the whole of the session of 1909 neither the noble Earl nor anybody else took the slightest step to bring this subject before the House. I think that is not an irrelevant fact when we are taunted with attempting to closure discussion. Then we have been told that, after all, we have no right to speak of these Resolutions as vague, because, if possible, we are vaguer still. That is perfectly true; but then we do not profess to begin with a plan. What we ask for are powers to have a voice in framing a plan. As a matter of fact, we have no voice in framing such a plan except such as noble Lords opposite choose to give us. They are in an impregnable position because, if we offer any suggestion, we are liable to be told, "If you do not like it, you can have always the status quo." That is a pure advantage to noble Lords opposite. It is this which makes us feel that to attempt discussion of the details of the reform of the House of Lords would be futile so far as we are concerned.<lb/>
A word as regards the Resolutions. It has been pointed out by my noble friend behind me, Lord St. Davids, that the application of the Resolutions suggested by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, would involve the disappearance from the scene of more than half of the members of your Lordships' House. That, I think, is easily shown. It was to be a considerably smaller House, with at any rate not more than two-thirds of the present number, and it was not to be more than half hereditary. Therefore it is clear that more than half of the present House must go. It is rather a singular fact, if that is the proposition, that the House should not be more fully attended on this occasion; and if the reason be that my noble friend on the Cross Benches had to proceed at short notice, it certainly does seem a little hard that those noble Lords who are going to have their fate declared to-night should have had no opportunity of making their protest. Because I may remind the House that it is a very different affair to say that the mere possession of an hereditary title shall not give a man a claim to a seat in this House from wiping out at one blow more than half of its members. The first might merely mean that a man who had done something particularly dis
<col>752</col>
creditable should be removed, as was proposed in what was called the Black Sheep Bill. But this proposal is of so sweeping a character, if it is carried out in the way propounded by Lord Curzon, that I am almost tempted to say that it might be difficult to rely on noble Lords opposite, supposing they were in a position to bring it forward, being able to carry it against a possible majority of those who preferred to remain on the present terms to retiring into private life. As regards the question of voting either for or against these Resolutions, I assume that nobody desires to divide the House against them. If anybody did, I should not vote but should walk out of the House, and for this reason. I think there is a great deal to be said in support of all the propositions advanced by my noble friend, and I think it is exceedingly probable that when the House of Lords is reformed, some or all of them may become elements in its new constitution.<lb/>
But I do not feel the certainty which some noble Lords seem to feel that all three of these principles will necessarily, when your Lordships' House is reformed, be brought into action. The first Resolution is that Peers shall be chosen from among hereditary Peers. I confess I do not take it as an absolute certainty that, when your Lordships' House is reformed the hereditary element will be present at all. I can conceive, from the Radical point of view, that the country may desire to be represented in a Second Chamber only by those elected to such a Chamber. But what is much more, the noble Marquess said something of profound meaning in relation to this question of election which I think night also give your Lordships' pause. I can quite conceive that the most Conservative elements in the country might be driven by the assertion of Conservative principles involving the necessity of a strong Second Chamber positively to prefer an elected House to a House which was weakened by the infusion of a strong hereditary element. The noble Marquess did not put the matter in quite the same way, but he arrived at a somewhat similar conclusion on the possibility of what might follow the introduction of an elected element in the House.<lb/>
That is No. 1. Then there is No. 2. The noble Marquess again dwelt with some force on the extreme difficulty which
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0381"/>
<col>753</col>
confronts you when you come to decide who is to sit by qualification. You may find yourselves in possession of a Chamber full of scarcely anybody but retired Admirals, Generals, and Ambassadors, and therefore I do not feel at all certain, when the reform of your Lordships' House comes, that this question of the necessity of qualification being one of the means of entering it will form part of the actual Reform Act. Then, again, No. 3&#x2014;chosen from outside. There again I do not feel certain that it is an absolute necessity that if this House were reformed it should contain anybody chosen from outside. That may seem a disputable proposition, but I can conceive a reform of the House&#x2014;a reform, that is, of the acting and active part of the House&#x2014;which would not necessarily involve the introduction of either elected or non-elected members. And therefore I confess it seems to me that the House is a little rash in committing itself to-night to the proposition, not merely that some of these changes, but that all these three changes must necessarily form part of any reform scheme. It is true, in a sense, that it does not matter. A vote for a Resolution does not necessarily bind one for life, and I suspect that, when the time comes when a reform of your Lordships' House is put forward, there will be some who will not find it necessary to adhere to the proposition that all these three changes must necessarily take place.<lb/>
I have only one more thing to say. Noble Lords to-night have carefully said&#x2014;the noble Earl Lord Selborne said, and the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition said before he sat down&#x2014;that it must not be supposed that, even if these Resolutions were turned into a Bill and the Bill were carried and the House were reformed, that the whole question is at an end; that there remained the question of the relations between the two Houses. I am bound to repeat once more that, until this week, I have never heard a suggestion of the kind from the Benches opposite. We have always been given to understand that the question of the relations between the two Houses was one which would probably be entirely solved by a partial reconstruction of your Lordships' House. What I understood to be the argument was this. At present people were able to say, "Here are Liberal Bills thrown out by a number of gentlemen,
<col>754</col>
some of whom are not at all interested in politics, and all of whom, or almost all of whom, are only here by right of birth." And that is a weak position. But once you reform the House&#x2014;I understood this was the argument&#x2014;the nation would be so much impressed by the quality and character of the reformed House that no such thing as a question of deadlock could arise, because when the reformed Upper House threw out a measure which came from the Lower House, the nation would have so much respect for the reformed Upper House that the House of Commons would in that case have to wait until the next General Election to secure a return to power and have a chance of bringing in the same measure again, when, if the House of Lords were convinced that the country wanted it, it would be passed. That has always been the attitude until this week, and when it is complained of us that we have devoted our attention solely to this question of deadlock and difference, I am bound to point out that the question of deadlock and difference has never before earned the slightest notice of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02112"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of prolonging this debate for more than a minute or two. I am quite unable to verify or contradict the statement last made by my noble friend (Lord Crewe). It has come upon me as a complete surprise that the question of deadlock has never even been contemplated by the Bench behind me. If it is so, it is a most surprising circumstance. I gave them credit for being something above the par of idiots, but apparently I was wrong. They seem to have been living in a balloon, as Mr. Gladstone or Mr. Bright once said, utterly unaware of the circumstances of this world and utterly unprepared to deal with them. Of all the harsh things passed about in the recent controversy, 1 know of nothing more cutting or more severe, uttered by my noble friend in his usual courteous tones, than what lie has been pleased to say about noble Lords behind me.<lb/>
I wish to advert to the point which my noble friend also raised as to the attendance in this House to-night. I must honestly say I do not know why he should be disappointed with the attendance, unless he looks at his supporters behind him. But, considering the shortness of the notice,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0382"/>
<col>755</col>
the attendance is at least of an average character and represents the working and the most habitual elements in this House. It is extremely difficult to please the Bench opposite. If there is a large attendance in this House and a large vote is taken, they then say, "These are gentlemen who do not usually attend the business of this House. They have no business to be here at all. Let them go back to their hayfields and let them not trouble the Legislature at all." On the other hand, when von have a substantial House, composed of habitual attendants, they say. "Where are those gentlemen who ought now to be in their places? How singularly little interest "and that is so when I look on the Benches opposite&#x2014;" they show in Parliamentary proceedings."<lb/>
But there is a more serious point. My noble friend says it is not his business to reform the House of Lords; that his business is of a different character. His business apparently, as far as I understand it, I will illustrate by a metaphor. A sick man calls in a physician, who at once opens a third-floor window and throws the patient on to the ground, announcing that that is what he has come to do. And, when he has cleared the apartment in that way, lie may, at some future time, replace the patient in his bed unless, in the meantime, the patient has been carried to the churchyard. But would it not be worth while for my noble friend, who has high Constitutional views as to the relations of the two Houses, to proffer some scheme for the reform of this House? It is not this House which is in an impregnable position. It is my noble friend himself. He is supported by a very great majority in the predominant Chamber. He has a great feeling in the country behind him. No one can doubt who looks round that the feeling as regards the hereditary principle in this House has rather increased and strengthened where it was already strong. He has all these great elements behind him, and a Government of remarkably able men to assist him. Yet, the only way in which he can deal with this high Constitutional question, involving the history of England for centuries past, involving the whole balance of the British Constitution, compromising the whole future of the country, is to have recourse to a perpetual series of General Elections without offering the slightest plan of their own for the reform of this House. When they come and say
<col>756</col>
that is not their business, they must remember that they do contemplate that it is their business at some time or another &#x2014;that is to say when the patient is dead. "At some future time," according to the immortal preamble which is associated in political circles with the name of Sir Edward Grey. When we come to that immortal preamble and consider the prospect that it holds out to us on the part of an almost omnipotent Government, and contrast that with what a comparatively feeble Opposition is doing in the way of trying to reconstruct and reform this House, I honestly confess I do not think it is the part of the Government to plume themselves on their position, or even to discourage the humble, and, as my noble friend said, the too vague efforts of those on the Cross Benches to try to produce a plan which may at some time form the basis of a scheme for the reform of this House. At any rate, that is doing something, and that is better than doing nothing.<lb/>
My noble friend touched also on the fact that Lord Curzon had gone much more into detail as regards his own plan than I have. I confess I thought that, having indicated at an earlier stage the dangers of going too strictly into a plan, my noble friend sailed uncommonly near the wind. He did point out the proportions which recommended themselves to his mind without taking any notice of the proportions which might recommend themselves to my mind or to the minds of others who were interested. However, I do not complain of that, I deliberately abstained from doing anything of the kind; but what I do say is this&#x2014;that, whatever our view may be as to the proportions&#x2014;I do not suppose that those who have studied this question on the Committee or otherwise are very far apart on that question&#x2014;if you adopt these Resolutions as your base there are not any ten men who have studied the subject honestly and sincerely who would not, in a very brief time. frame a practicable scheme of reform in detail for the House of Lords.<lb/>
If that be so that is a great point gained. We shall not mind sneers at the vagueness or generality of our expressions, and we shall not mind inquiry as to the percentages we propose to allocate to various proportions in this House. We shall leave this House to-night, I think, with the conviction that though it may be late in the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0383"/>
<col>757</col>
day&#x2014;Lunch later, I admit, than I myself could have wished&#x2014;though it may be late in the day, we have at any rate in our feebleness and our impotence made a substantial step in the direction which every public-spirited and reasonable man desires who wishes to avoid the incredible dangers and tyranny of single-Chamber government.<lb/>
With regard to the last Resolution, I want to say this. I think it errs against my own canons and goes too far into detail. Many noble Lords interested in the question might have ground for questioning it, and for the same reason for which I begged Lord. Portsmouth to withdraw his Amendment, I beg leave to withdraw the second Resolution on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE DISSOLUTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02129"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the honour to announce to the House that His Majesty the King, acting upon the advice of his Ministers, has decided to dissolve this Parliament with a view to calling together a new one. Before I offer to the House any statement of the reasons which prompted His Majesty's Government to tender that advice to the Crown, I think it will be convenient if I say a few words on the question of time in relation to the business of the House, indeed of both Houses. So far as the business of this House is concerned, we have on the Paper for Monday the important Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal on the Cross Benches. Of course I am not in a position to say how much time your Lordships may desire to give to the discussion of that Motion. Then there is the Parliament Bill, as to which we have had no intimation as to whether your Lordships desire to proceed with it, but assuming for the moment that you do, I also assume that you will desire to give at any rate sonic days to its discussion. As regards the business in another place, there are three Bills which it is necessary should be passed into law before Parliament can properly be dissolved. In the first place there is the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, there is also such part of the provision for the finance of the year as is necessary to deal with those taxes which are annual and not permanent; and in the third place there is the appropriation of a sum of money for purposes connected with old age pensions which it is imperative should be made before the close of the year. I understand that this business can pass through another place before the close of next week. That being so His Majesty's Government see no reason why the Dissolution of Parliament should not take place on Monday, November 28.<lb/>
This Parliament is not yet a year old, and it is, I am convinced, due to the House
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0385"/>
<col>761</col>
that in making this announcement I should also attempt as briefly as possible to give some account of the reasons which have caused the Government thus to approach the Crown. I do not think it is necessary to trace our recent political history so far as it covers the relations between the two Houses and the proposals for the reform of your Lordships' House. They are all familiar to any man in this House who follows current politics at all. But I understand that it is maintained on the Benches opposite that there is no reason why Parliament should be dissolved at this time, and we have been told that the breakdown of the Conference on the Constitution offers no reason why the life of this Parliament should be brought to a close. My noble friend Lord Courtney devoted the greater part of his speech last night to an argument to this effect, and he observed that to assert that the breakdown of the Conference necessarily involved a Dissolution of Parliament was&#x2014;he put it in the pleasantest way&#x2014;to attach too great importance to those who took part in that Conference. My point of view is entirely different. It is in fact the conviction of our own comparative unimportance which makes me feel that the close of tire Conference in one sense makes it imperative that we should appeal to the opinion of the country. It is, however, not accurate to say that it is the breakdown of the Conference which causes the Dissolution of Parliament.<lb/>
The question of asking for a Dissolution must necessarily depend upon the conviction of the Ministers of the Crown as to what is the general position at the moment. There are two opposing arguments as to the course that might be taken. It is argued that we might have proceeded to discuss this great Constitutional question, ignoring the Conference altogether, and proceeding in the ordinary way by Bill. To that it is answered that it would be a futile course, not because the Conference has broken down, but because the two Parties in the State cannot on this subject be brought together. Now in support of that view I venture to quote some words which were spoken yesterday by Mr. Balfour at Nottingham. I am in the fortunate position of being able to use his words for a great part of my remarks on this particular subject&#x2014;in a fortunate position because he puts the point with far more felicity than I could hope to attain.<lb/>
<col>762</col>
Mr. Balfour, speaking of the Conference, said this&#x2014;
<quote>"We meet at a moment in which every mist of misrepresentation seems to exhale from the authorised reports of what went on at the recent Conference. Do not believe a word of it. (Cheers.) Do not believe that there was the smallest want of absolute unanimity among all those on whom was thrown the duty of representing you and your interests, your views, your policy, at a Conference which, I believe, although not effectual, and unfruitful as it has proved, will yet be not without good results to the country, and which may well be a precedent for other Conferences dealing with great national interests, which may mitigate the evils incident to party divisions. Do not you believe for one instant that the decision at which we arrived is one which if you bad all the facts before you, you would have dissented from. On the contrary, I am perfectly certain that we should have been regarded as traitors to our cause had we gone further than we did go in the direction of that peace and good will between the parties which, I readily admit, our four Radical colleagues in the Conference were anxious to further. I readily admit it. I believe we all desired agreement. But if we had agreed upon the only terms upon which agreement was possible you would have regarded us as not supporting, but as betraying, your cause. (Cheers.)"</quote>
Well, my Lords, I adopt the whole of that statement with the single alteration of the word "Conservative" for "Radical" in speaking of the opposing four who took part in the Conference. I adopt every word of the statement, and any one of us who took part in the Conference from this side could say precisely the same thing. It is evident that it must be so, because, if Mr. Balfour felt that he had not got his Party at his back in conceding more than he did, of course it is obvious that we must have been in a similar position. How after hearing or reading those words anybody can say that Parliament is to be dissolved because eight gentlemen meeting privately in a room could not conic to an agreement I confess I cannot conceive. What is clearly proved by that statement is precisely what I have maintained in the debates we have had during the last few days, that it was not a question of the disagreement of the eight men, but of the fundamental disagreement which, as all persons in a prominent position in either Party are aware, exists between the Liberal and the Unionist Parties on this matter.<lb/>
Yesterday the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, called attention to some words which I had used when I said that the question which now had to be decided was which Party should lay down the main lines of our future Parliamentary constitu
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0386"/>
<col>763</col>
tion so far as it is necessary to change it. The noble Earl took me severely to task for what I then said, but I am bound to adhere to every syllable that I then uttered. For surely it is clear that whatever may be the result of the discussions which will take place on this subject&#x2014;and I fully admit that at the right time the matter must necessarily demand and will certainly receive the fullest measure of discussion&#x2014;you must come to the point where one side or the other will get its way upon final points at issue, be those points great or be they small. You are now in the position that whichever Party is in power, when you come to that point, either a deadlock is produced or you get your way on those points of difference, great or small; and that fact it is which has prompted us to our present action.<lb/>
I think that in deciding to appeal to the country we are able to use an argument of your own; that is to say, that if a Party twice returned to office it is understood that the House of Lords gives way to the will of the country. My Lords, I ask a question, to which I do not, indeed, expect a precise answer; but what in the mind of noble Lords opposite was the precise effect of the election at the beginning of this year? So far as I have been able to understand, the contention is that the verdict of the country on that occasion was given on the finance proposals of the Government and that in consideration of the fact that we returned with a majority the Budget was promptly passed unaltered by this House; and I have certainly gained the impression that it is your Lordships' belief that by so doing you did practically all that was required of you&#x2014;that the confidence of the country in us might be reasonably supposed to he exhausted so far as other questions are concerned, and that, in fact, our mandate, if that is the word&#x2014;a word I personally hate&#x2014;might be held to have expired. Or, to put it in a more concrete form, that you would not agree that because we were returned to power a second time thereby you are bound to pass the Education Bill of 1906 in our form, or to pass the measure dealing with plural voting which your Lordships rejected in the early days of the last Parliament.<lb/>
If that is so, have we any guarantee that you would pay any attention to our point of view if we discussed this question either
<col>764</col>
of the powers or the reform of the house of Lords in the present Parliament? I confess that I do not think so. It seems to me that although your Lordships would, I am sure, approach the matter in a reasonable spirit from your point of view, yet if it is to be settled at all in this Parliament it must be settled on your lines. That, of course, is naturally what we desire, if possible, to avoid. That being so we have decided to give this advice to the Crown. It is quite true that we never have admitted the right of your Lordships' House to force a dissolution of Parliament; but in this case the circumstances are, I think, unique, and we believe that they justify us in appealing to the verdict of the country as to whether it is to be you or whether it is to be we who are to have the main voice in settling this question, and by the verdict of the country given at a General Election we are content to abide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02130"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not suppose that the House was entirely unprepared for the remarkable statement to which we have just listened. At the same time I think there are few of us who will not say that one more astounding has rarely been heard within the walls of this House. I doubt whether what I can only describe as a Parliamentary man&#x0153;uvre has ever been carried out with greater cynicism. What is the announcement to which we have just listened It is this&#x2014;that a Parliament, which has only been a few months in power, at the outset of its career, guided by a Ministry which loses no opportunity of informing us that their spirits are undaunted and that they have boundless beneficial proposals to make to the country&#x2014;a Government which has received up to the present moment no Parliamentary check&#x2014;that such a Parliament is to be dissolved before it has completed a year of office, with the result of making this country pass twice within twelve months through all the inconvenience of a General Election; and that at a moment which, by universal admission, will be considered, I think, peculiarly ill-chosen. It is surely unfortunate that at the very outset of a new reign this political turmoil should be gratuitously introduced, and at a season of the year when, naturally, men's thoughts turn to other and more pleasant subjects.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, why is this to be done? The noble Earl has told the House that we
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0387"/>
<col>765</col>
were wrong in supposing that it is merely on account of the breakdown of the Conference. The noble Earl gave us a somewhat ingenious explanation of this rather novel theory, because, as far as I am aware, until now it has been commonly believed that the breakdown of the Conference was the determining cause of the resolve of His Majesty's Government. The noble Earl told us it was not the breakdown of the Conference that had provoked this decision of His Majesty's Government, but their conviction that the two Parties could not be brought together in regard to this great Constitutional question; and he quoted with evident satisfaction a passage from the speech delivered last night by my right hon. friend Mr. Balfour at Nottingham, in which Mr. Balfour apparently insisted on the fact that at the Conference he and his three Unionist colleagues were absolutely unanimous in declining to entertain the proposals made to them by their opponents. I have not had much time to scan that speech with the attention it deserves, but I think it is perfectly evident to begin with that this statement of Mr. Balfour's must have been directed to assertions which have constantly been made in the Press and elsewhere to the effect that the Unionist members of the Conference were not unanimous and that Mr. Balfour's opinion was overborne by that of some of his colleagues. That was a mischievous rumour, to which I called attention the other evening. But Mr. Balfour apparently wept on to say that we should have been traitors to our cause if we had accepted the terms offered to us by the noble Earl and his colleagues. It is perfectly possible that in our view we should have been traitors to our cause if we had accepted the whole of the proposals made to us by the other side. But is that in itself conclusive evidence that this great question, with all its different complications, has been once and for all disposed of by the proceedings of the Conference? Far from it. Is it not obvious&#x2014;and I say this without any indiscretion&#x2014;is it not obvious that if the Conference sat, as it did, for months and held twenty-one sittings there must have been a certain measure of agreement between the two sides at some points? And because, unfortunately, we were not able to carry that opinion to the point of complete agreement, is it fair and reasonable to contend that the failure of the Conference has once and for all disposed of all
<col>766</col>
I chances of reasonable compromise and agreement between the two great Parties?<lb/>
My Lords, the noble Earl suggested that after what had happened there was no more to be said. I venture to tell him that neither he nor his colleagues, nor any one else, has any right to make a confident assertion of that kind. That is a question which can be answered one way or the other by Parliament, and by Parliament only. Our complaint of the conduct of the Government at this most important juncture is that what they are doing is really ousting Parliament from its proper opportunity of discussing and dealing with this question. And, my Lords, let me, if I may, accentuate what has been said by some of my noble friends, that in my belief Parliament would never have tolerated the proceedings of the Conference as it did, it never would have exhibited the extraordinary patience which it did exhibit during those long months, if it had believed that the proceedings of the Conference, held with closed doors and under the pledge of secrecy, were to be alleged as a reason for there being no further discussion in this House or the other House in the full light of day and under the full influence of public opinion outside.<lb/>
I really can only characterise the manner in which this subject has been treated as something very like a breach of faith with Parliament and the country. It is within our memory, and the evidence has lately been cited, that the. Government's Veto Resolutions which were carried through the other House were recommended by the Prime Minister merely as Resolutions preliminary to that fuller discussion. of the matter which would necessarily take place whenever a Bill might be brought before the Houses of Parliament and passed through all its stages. It is not only with regard to the opportunity which Parliament was led to expect that we had reason for complaint. Distinct statements were made to Parliament, not only with regard to the manner in which this question was to be brought before it in order that there might be, to use the Prime Minister's words, "a legislative enactment"&#x2014;a very different thing from a Veto Resolution&#x2014;dealing with the question, but we were told in very definite language how His Majesty's Government intended to govern their own conduct with regard to this question.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0388"/>

I will recall to the attention of the House what I think I may call the pledges given to Parliament by the Prime Minister on April 14 last. I will not quote his words <i>in extenso</i> but they came to this: that His Majesty's Government threatened resignation or dissolution in a certain event. What was the event in which they threatened either resignation or dissolution? "If the Lords fail to accept our policy or decline to consider it as it is formally presented to the House." Have the Lords failed to accept the policy of His Majesty's Government? Has it ever been formally presented to this House? You have never given us the opportunity, you have never formally presented your proposals to the House and I go further, and I assert that you never meant to do so. It is within every one's knowledge that the Prime Minister announced his intention of making some such statement as that which we have heard this afternoon at a time when there was no question of the Parliament Bill coming before us at all. We humbly asked that the Parliament Bill should be laid before this House and that we should have that opportunity of considering it which we were promised. The noble Earl, when that appeal was made to him, with his customary courtesy at once said that our request was a perfectly reasonable one, and that he intended to grant it. So far, so good; but when the noble Earl proceeded with his speech we found that the position was not by any means of the character of which we hoped it was going to be.<lb/>
I think it is said that the month of March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. The noble Earl's conduct was quite different. He began like a lamb and ended like a lion&#x2014;for, having told us at the beginning that our request was reasonable, he went on to give us an idea of what kind of reasonable opportunity he intended to give your Lordships of dealing with the Parliament Bill. He told us we were not even to attempt to enter into a discussion, not only of the proposals for reform of the House of Lords, but of alternative proposals which might be brought forward dealing with questions covered by the Parliament Bill. So that we are not only to be precluded from discussing, in connection with the Parliament Bill, proposals for the reform of this House&#x2014;which, of course, have reference to a somewhat different branch of the subject&#x2014;but we are to be
<col>768</col>
called to order if we attempt to discuss proposals for dealing with deadlocks between the two Houses, which is the very subject that the Parliament Bill is intended to dispose of. The noble Earl went on to say that any attempt at such a. discussion on our part would be a mere waste of time. The Bill is presented to the House for the House to take or to leave. That is the noble Earl's idea of the amount of consideration the House of Lords ought to give to a Bill of the most important description, and one vitally affecting the whole position and future of this House of Parliament.<lb/>
I want to say one word in regard to another intimation which was made by the Prime Minister on April 14. On that occasion the right hon. gentleman used somewhat oracular words; but they were words which most people thought they understood, and to which a great deal of attention was paid at the moment. He said that in no case would he and his colleagues recommend a Dissolution&#x2014;
<quote>"except under such conditions as will secure that in the new Parliament the judgment of the people as expressed at the General Election kill be carried into law."</quote>
Now, I hope before this discussion closes we shall be told whether that pledge still holds good, that we shall be told something, at any rate, of the nature of those conditions, and whether those conditions have been secured.<lb/>
I do not think I need much longer detain your Lordships. I listened with profound regret to the noble Earl's -statement, particularly as coming from his lips. He is the Leader of the House of Lords, and in a sense he is, or should be, the guardian of the rights of this House. One of the principal rights of this House is that it should exercise freely its duty of revising legislation. What opportunity of revision does the noble Earl think of giving us in regard to this Parliament Bill? I will ask him to judge the matter by his own standard. If your Lordships will look at the Parliament Bill you will find that under the procedure contemplated the House of Lords is to have the opportunity of rejecting no less than three times, within a space of no less than two years, any Bill of the most ordinary description, such as a Bill dealing with the purely domestic matter of vaccination, or some thing of that kind. But what is going to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0389"/>
<col>769</col>
happen in the case of the Parliament Bill? The Bill itself is apparently to be allowed to flit across the Table of this House, but there is to be no discussion and there are to be no Amendments. Then comes the General Election, and apparently, if the Government secure a majority of half-a-dozen votes, the Bill is to be imposed upon a muzzled and helpless House of Lords. That is, I venture to think, a serious affront to this House. I expressed the other evening the opinion that the treatment of this House amounted to something like an outrage. That, to my mind, is the only word which adequately describes it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02131"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will not think that I am unduly intruding myself upon the House if I ask permission to say a word or two before any reply is given to the very able and judicious speech to which we have just listened from the noble Marquess. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, in the course of his speech, stated that the mandate of this Parliament was exhausted. I agree with him that the expression "mandate"&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02132"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that that was my view. I said I understood it was the view of noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02133"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl is going to interpret the views of noble Lords on this side he might give us quotations. I do not think there has been anything said on this side that would at all bear the interpretation that we thought the mandate of this Parliament was exhausted. Indeed, a great part of our case is that the mandate of this Parliament has not been exhausted. Whatever the mandate of this Parliament was, the interruption which took place by the lamented death of the late King prevented our having an opportunity of judging upon the proposals of the Government. I do not assent to the idea that because the matter has never been discussed therefore we ought to be precluded from the opportunity of discussing it. The Government have never tried; they have never given this House a chance of expressing an opinion upon their policy. There has been a policy put forward by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches which has had a very large amount of support. It does not please the Government; but because
<col>770</col>
that policy has been discussed and does not please the Government is no excuse, in my opinion, for their refusal to give this House a reasonable, proper, and judicious opportunity of discussing the proposals of the Government themselves.<lb/>
Now what is the position of the House with regard to the Parliament Bill? The noble Earl said, in the course of his speech, that he was uncertain whether we wished to proceed with it. My answer to that&#x2014;and I can only give my own personal answer&#x2014;is that before we can reply to that question we want to know what our position is in regard to the Bill. Supposing, for the sake of argument, that the House were to take the Second Reading of the Bill and proceed to discuss it in Committee, would that be agreeable to noble Lords opposite? Do they intend to take an intelligent part in the discussion of these proposals? Do they intend to discuss Amendments which may be put forward, or is their answer to be the ultimatum&#x2014;"You must take the Bill as it stands or leave it altogether"? We have never actually been told whether that is so or not. The noble Earl spoke with two voices the other night. He seemed at; first to indicate that that was absolutely to be the case, and that we were to have no chance of having an Amendment even considered; but later on I understood him to say that he would wait and see what the Amendments were before coming to a final decision. Therefore I ask, How do we stand in the matter?<lb/>
If the Bill is put before the House as the ultimatum of the Government, then I am perfectly certain that, the attitude of the Government towards the House is very different from the attitude of the representatives of the Government at the Conference; because I am perfectly certain that if they had gone to the Conference and said, "This is the Bill. You must take it or leave it," it would not have taken the Conference twenty-one days to come to a decision on such a point. It certainly would not have been six months in doubt as to what would be the answer from noble Lords on this side and. the representatives of the Unionist Party in the House of Commons upon a point like that. Therefore I may assume that that was not the attitude of the representatives of the Government in the Conference. Therefore I ask this question&#x2014;Is Parliament, is the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0390"/>
<col>771</col>
House of Lords, to be treated worse than the two noble Lords who represented at the Conference the Opposition side of the House? It is quite possible that the noble Earl is right in thinking that an agreement is not likely to be arrived at. But I protest against that assumption. Surely we might be given the chance of seeing whether agreement is or is not possible. It is only by intelligent discussion that we can come to know what separates us. And if we are not to have that discussion, surely it is absurd to say that there has been any real consideration of the undoubted difficulties that have arisen between the two Houses. I ask in all seriousness&#x2014;Why is Parliament to be worse treated in this important matter? Why are the men who were not represented by those who took part in the Conference not to have an opportunity of intelligent discussion?<lb/>
Let me digress and explain for a moment. One of my particular grievances in regard to the present political situation is that we are getting into a position in which only the extreme men on each side tell. The moderate man, as he is called, is more and more, being shut out and denied the opportunity of bringing his influence to bear. I contend that the genius of the British people is this, that it is exactly on large Constitutional questions of this kind that, in the long run, the opinion of the moderate man tells. But by the action taken by the Government those of us who would like to come to a settlement of this great Constitutional question without undue strife and without undue trouble are absolutely prevented from bringing such influence as we may have to bear. I say that that is a real grievance.<lb/>
Let me go on with the supposition that this Bill is to be brought before us next week with a real desire for its discussion. Monday may or may not be available; I believe it will be occupied by the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal on the Cross Benches. But even if the House were to be allowed the whole of the four or five days of next week for the discussion of the Parliament Bill, the time would still be insufficient for so great a subject, for the Bill is not reform, but revolution. It is an absolute change from the whole constitutional history of this country, and I say that if you are going to ask for an intelligent discussion of far-reaching questions of that kind you ought to give an old institution
<col>772</col>
like this House more than four days to make up its mind and bring its influence to bear in regard to it. So it is practically a farce to suppose that this Bill can be really adequately discussed in the time which is now at our disposal. The whole course of events shows that the introduction of it was a mere-afterthought on the part of the Government. They had no intention of introducing it here at all until they were challenged to do so by the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench. It would have been perfectly fair to have challenged us upon the Bill and then to have gone to the country upon the result of that challenge and that discussion; but it is not sufficient to give us only four days for this purpose. Therefore, it really seems to me a matter of the smallest importance whether we go on with it or not. So far as I am concerned, I am ready for it either way. The promise of the Prime Minister to give full and adequate opportunity for discussion has not been fulfilled by the meagre allowance which is now proposed to us.<lb/>
I have only one other question to put. I do not know whether I ought to put it, but I think I may as well. The noble Earl mentioned three or four Bills which were likely to come up. By having the election in this particular month a curious anomaly occurs, because the new Scottish register comes into operation on November 1, but the new English register only on January 1. I do not know whether there is any precedent or any practical inconvenience in having the elections in England and Scotland on different registers. There has been a suggestion that the English register was to be expedited. Perhaps the noble Earl will say whether a Bill for that purpose is to be introduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02134"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord has asked me two questions I will do my best to answer them. So far as his last question is concerned I understand that it is not intended to attempt to accelerate the operation of the register in England by a Bill. Then the noble Lord asks this question&#x2014;Supposing, he said your Lordships read the Parliament Bill a second time, are we to have a full discussion on Amendments? It is difficult to answer that question, as I said before, until one has some idea what those Amendments are. The carrying of Amendments which substitute an entirely different method of procedure for that contem-
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0391"/>
<col>773</col>
plated by the Bill would, in our judgment, be equivalent to a rejection of the Bill. As the noble Lord with all his experience knows very well, there are very few Bills that you cannot kill by means of an Amendment.<lb/>
But with regard to the question of Amendments at all there appears to be this difficulty&#x2014;that, according to the arguments of noble Lords opposite, which were so fully developed yesterday, you cannot touch this subject at all until you have reformed the House, because&#x2014;this was the argument used by the noble Marquess&#x2014;everything as regards the relations between the two Houses depends upon the precise composition of this House, and therefore the conclusion appears to be that before you can amend the Parliament Bill you must have passed your House of Lords reform measure, and it is evident, even if noble Lords opposite were more agreed on that subject than they are, that it is quite impossible to bring in a Bill for that purpose within the next few days. And therefore, when noble Lords speak of amending the Parliament Bill, I am not quite sure what they mean. I quite admit that in answering the noble Marquess the day before yesterday I was hampered in my reply by not being able to announce the forthcoming Dissolution of Parliament; but assuming, as noble Lords did for the purposes of their argument, that Parliament was going to be dissolved, they wanted an opportunity of putting in general terms before the country their views upon the Parliament Bill and the House of Lords question generally. As I said, that seems to me a perfectly reasonable thing to do; but it is another thing from saying that it is necessary to exhaust by way of amendment in Committee discussion upon every conceivable method by which the relations between the two Houses may be adjusted, and I should have thought that, from noble Lords' point of view, it would not help their case. They want, I take it, just as much as we do, to put a simple issue to the country, and how far that would be helped by an elaborate discussion in Committee of every conceivable proposal appears to me exceedingly doubtful. As a matter of fact, the issue which will be put before the country, either by the practical acceptance or the practical rejection of the Parliament Bill, is one which, I believe, the country will be well able to understand.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02135"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>:My Lords, I think we are in some little doubt as to what exactly is the intention of the Government. The noble Earl spoke as if the course of the Government depended to some extent upon the attitude which your Lordships may take towards the Parliament Bill. Is the Dissolution fixed or is it not? The noble Earl used language which is capable of either interpretation. The dubitative note may have only been a sort of technical doubt inasmuch as the decision lies with the Sovereign, but it may be that the Government have not yet made up their minds as to whether the Dissolution is to be on Monday week or not. We all think that your Lordships' House and Parliament have been treated with scant courtesy, not in the words of the noble Earl but in the policy of the Government. I think we might be told in plain language whether the Dissolution is to take place on Monday week or not. What we desire and what we have a right to demand is that a Bill submitted to Parliament should be discussed in Parliament&#x2014;that is to say, discussed in all its stages, in order that the country may be fully informed as to the arguments which may be advanced in its favour and the criticisms which may be made against it.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02159"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, owing to the withdrawal by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts of the Motion which he had placed on the Paper I am
<col>778</col>
able to ask you to-day to give a Second Reading to this Bill. But before saying anything upon it I ought to express the regret which we must all feel, on Lord Roberts's account, that he felt himself unable to proceed with the discussion of a subject in which, as we know, he takes the profound interest of an expert, and as to which on this particular occasion he had, I think, looked forward to a discussion of great importance. On the other hand, in view of the state of public business and of the condition of public affairs generally it is possible, perhaps, that the noble Earl may have not wished at this moment, when Party passion, I our afraid, may be beginning to run high, to discuss the question of national defence, more particularly as the objects which he has in his mind are certainly not Party objects and his views are not by any means universally shared by noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
Now, in regard to the Parliament Bill, the origin of this particular controversy goes back four years. It goes back to the winter of 1906 when the first Education Bill of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Government failed to pass into law. The Bill failed to pass into law after strenuous attempts to arrive at a compromise, but compromise was found impossible and the Bill was lost. It was lost owing to the unwillingness of your Lordships' House to include in its provisions principles upon which, as we believed, the mind of the country had been most clearly expressed at the General Election of the preceding winter, and, as your Lordships will all remember, its loss was received not merely with regret but with no little indignation on, the part of those who had its success at heart. On December 20, 1906, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, speaking in another place, said&#x2014;
<quote>"A way must be found and a way will be found by which the will of the people, as expressed through their elected representatives in this House, will be made to prevail."</quote>
Then in the King's Speech, when Parliament met on February 12 in the following year, that thesis was developed by the then Prime Minister in words which will be found in the pages of <i>Hansard</i> The almost immediate sequel to that challenge, for I think I may so call it, was the Resolution which the House of Commons passed on June 26 of the same year. That Resolution read&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0394"/>
<col>779</col>
<quote>"That in order to give effect to the will of the people as expressed by their elected representatives, it is necessary that the power of the other House to alter or reject Bills passed by this House should be so restricted by law as to secure that within the limits of a single Parliament the final decisions of the Commons shall prevail."</quote>
That Resolution was carried on a Division by 434 against 149.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be permitted very briefly to remind your Lordships of what the terms of the plan at that time were. Speaking generally they were these. When a disagreement occurred between the two Houses a private Conference was to take place; and if agreement was not arrived at through that Conference, the Bill was lost for the time. It could be reintroduced either with or without amendment after a period of six months, and if the two Houses again failed to agree a second Conference was to be called. If agreement was then not reached, the Bill was to be reintroduced and passed by some rapid process, and a third Conference might be held, but if agreement was then not reached, the Bill was to become law over the heads of your Lordships' House. The remainder of the plan consisted in a provision for quinquennial Parliaments&#x2014;that is to say, Parliaments of which the ordinary duration would be four years, for reasons with which your Lordships are all familiar.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, as the controversy proceeded, the relations as between the two Houses I fear did not improve. The Plural Voting Bill had already been rejected by your Lordships' House very summarily, and not less summarily the Licensing Bill of 1908 received its short shrift at your Lordships' hands. In 1908, also, fresh attempts were made at a settlement of the education question, but those attempts proved to be again a failure. Then came the unprecedented rejection in 1909 of the whole financial arrangements for the year. The General Election followed, but the Government, although returned to power, found itself in no degree nearer the capacity of carrying controversial Bills than it had been all through the Parliament preceding. That, my Lords, is in brief the reason and the justification for the introduction of this measure.<lb/>
Now, it is desirable to explain in what, essentials this Bill differs from the earlier
<col>780</col>
proposals which I have described. I will do so by going rapidly through its operative provisions. The first clause deals with finance. It gives to the other House complete control over Money Bills, but it contains the important provision and makes the important admission on which your Lordships laid stress in your famous Standing Order of 1702&#x2014;namely, that it was riot proper to annex to a Money Bill matter foreign to or different from matters of aid or supply. The force of that Standing Order is admitted in Clause 1, and the decision as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not is left by Clause 1 to the Speaker of the House of Commons&#x2014;an impartial authority, at any rate an impartial authority so far as the memory of any man now alive goes back, and to whom in the opinion of His Majesty's Government that immensely important duty may be fitly entrusted. But I may perhaps venture to say that if some other tribunal within Parliament could be found which could be expected to carry out these duties with equal authority and equal impartiality, that is not a matter which we should regard as vital to the Bill.<lb/>
The second part of the Bill deals with general legislation, and the effect of its provisions is that if a measure passes in another place during three successive sessions spreading over two years it will become law. In the earlier proposals much was said about conferring between the two Houses, and it is a matter upon which the late Prime Minister dwelt at length when he introduced his proposals The Bill which is before us does not explicitly provide for the holding of Conferences, but in the opinion of the framers of the Bill the holding of Conferences is a cardinal matter in relation to the whole question. Nothing, I think, is more curious to any one who takes the trouble to look at the history of the relations between the two Houses than the gradual decline and final disuse of the practice of Conferences between the Lords and the Commons. The causes may be numerous, but one cause undoubtedly was that the later Conferences which were held&#x2014;I am speaking for the moment of formal Conferences&#x2014;seem to have become so rigid and so unnatural in their character that it was felt that the practice carried with it little of value. But I do not hesitate to say that in my opinion one of the reasons why the relations between the two Houses have
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0395"/>
<col>781</col>
hardened and crystallised into their present condition&#x2014;a condition, that is to say, of something like perpetual conflict when one Party is in power and of perpetual acquiescence when the other Party is in power&#x2014;may be traced to the complete abandonment of this habit of conferring. Conferences between the two Houses are of old date. They go back, I believe, to the reign of Edward III; and from the time when the Commons' Journals were regularly kept, I am told that within the 150 years from 1547 to 1702 any one who searches the Index to these Journals will find that upwards of twenty pages of the Index are given up to reports of the Conferences that were held between the two Houses on every variety of subject and covering the widest possible field. I therefore do not hesitate to say that the revival of the custom of frequent Conferences between the two Houses is of the very essence of the proposals which we are placing before your Lordships to-day.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I would call your attention to an important change from the former proposals, and it is that relating to the identity of the: Bill to be sent up on a later occasion&#x2014;identity except so far as may be agreed&#x2014;as compared with the proposal originally made that the Bill might be amended in another place and sent up as the same Bill. It seems to me that the real issue as between the two Parties&#x2014;and this I gather from what has been said in this House and on many platforms&#x2014;the real issue as between the two Parties with regard to these proposals is, "What is the real value of delay and of opportunities for consideration for the purpose of amending Bills?" That is to say, are you more likely to get a Bill into a final shape that sensible men, its principle having been approved, will agree is the best shape&#x2014;are you more likely to get it into such a shape by delay, consultation, and consideration than by a process of summary rejection, followed, perhaps, by a General Election, and if not by a General Election by a Referendum, as I understand is proposed in a Motion on the Paper by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh.<lb/>
It is useful in discussing the question of delay and consideration on the one side, and a more immediate appeal to the country on the other, for the purpose of improving a Bill or of deciding its fate,
<col>782</col>
to consider one or two concrete instances. I believe it is to the benefit of both Parties, and, what is more important, to the benefit of the country, to get out of the region of abstract Constitution-making, because what the country is most interested in is "What is likely to be the effect of these proposals or of any other alternative proposals in their practical import and in relation to the fate of Bills before Parliament" Now Parliament is not an end in itself; it is a means, a machine for doing certain things for the nation. It is a machine for doing three things. It exists for the purpose of keeping a check on the Executive; it exists for the purpose of raising money for the public service; and it exists also, although it is not its primary object of existence, for the purpose of passing legislation. I ask your Lordships to consider what would have been the probable fate of one or two well-known measures either under our proposals, or under the proposals which I understand to he generally those of the other side.<lb/>
I will take first the Home Rule Bill of 1893, a favourite battle-horse, I need not say, of noble Lords opposite, because it is a measure which above all others is supposed to have vindicated the judgment of your Lordships' House. I say without hesitation that the Home Rule Bill of 1893, looking back at it horn this distance of time, would not have passed either test&#x2014;it would not have passed the test of a General Election or of a Referendum, which I understand would be the proposal, according to Mr. Balfour's speech at Nottingham, for dealing with the question. Neither would it have stood the test of the proposals under the Parliament Bill. The Home Rule Bill of 1893, supported by the majority with which it was supported, would not have stood the test in the then temper of the country of three sessions of discussion. Therefore, I think that we may regard ourselves as quits as to the merits of the two systems on that particular question. Then I will take a Bill of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;the Education Act of 1902. I presume that the Education Act of 1902 would have passed this House very much in the forth in which it did pass for the simple reason that even if the House of Lords had been reformed according to the ideas of noble Lords it would not have become the subject of discussion between the two Houses; but if Lord Balfour's plan had been in force,
 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0396"/>
<col>783</col>
and if the Act of 1902 had had to be submitted to a Referendum it certainly would not have been the law of the land at this moment. Therefore from that point of view our proposals, I think, are kinder to the legislation of noble Lords opposite than the proposals of a distinguished member of their Party, supported, as I understand, by many other distinguished members.<lb/>
Next I come to the Education Bill of 1906. I say without hesitation that if the Education Bill of 1906 had had to go through the processes enjoined by this Parliament Bill, it would have come out, as I believe, a satisfactory measure, and a measure which would have given us a settlement of our elementary education question for ninny years to come. But here again I am making a present to noble Lords opposite, because if that Education Bill had been made the subject of a General Election or of a Referendum the Bill which would have been put to the country would have been the Bill in its House of Commons form. That, I think, is quite evident. If you differ you can only put one measure to the country, and the measure which you put to the country, is I assume, the measure as it passed the House of Commons. That would have undoubtedly involved the carrying of the Education Bill of 1906 in a form which would have been very much more satisfactory to many of those who support us on this side of the House, and very much less satisfactory to those who hold the views of noble Lords opposite. I venture to think that the Parliament Bill does not come very badly out of a comparison of those three cases; and I believe that noble Lords opposite have not attempted to realise the immense effect upon a measure of delay and discussion&#x2014;long delay and repeated discussion&#x2014;both in another place and here. I believe that in this country, as far as we are able to know the mind of the country, the danger of anything like cataclysmic legislation is an absolute minimum. Hurried and violent legislation is in my view thoroughly foreign to our national temperament. And if noble Lords agree with me it is hard to see what danger they find in our proposals. But, of course, noble Lords take some wild speech made by some quite insignificant person and point to it as indicating the probability that revolutionary changes&#x2014;changes of the kind desired by the Social Democratic Party&#x2014;are likely to be the result of passing into law this moderate
<col>784</col>
and harmless piece of legislation. Well, my Lords, I think I have shown that to describe this measure as in any sense a measure for the establishment of a Single Chamber is an absolute misnomer. If there is anything in what I have said&#x2014;and I shall be interested to see if noble Lords opposite attempt to deny it&#x2014;as to the power and force of delay and discussion, this is not a measure for the establishment of a Single Chamber.<lb/>
To this policy of delay and discussion various alternatives are suggested, alternatives which may themselves involve some delay and discussion, but which cannot be taken as if they would necessarily involve the same amount of delay and discussion as we have provided for in this Bill One of these alternative methods of proceeding was alluded to by Mr. Balfour at Nottingham. It is what is known as a joint sitting&#x2014;that is, that the two Houses in the event of disagreement may meet and the combined vote of both together decides the question. The idea of holding a joint session is not a new one, and I am very far from saying it is a bad one. I ought to be the last person to say it is a bad one, because, as is well known to your Lordships, the plan of a Joint Session forms part of the South Africa Act, for which I had the honour of being responsible last year. Section 63 of that Act provides for the holding of a Joint Session in case of difference. But I am bound to point out this; that when you talk of a Joint Session between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, however constituted, the problem which you have to face is not quite the same as that which presents itself in South Africa. The two Houses in South Africa are respectively 121 and 40 in number. For them to meet and discuss is a comparatively simple affair. But when you come to joining to a House of 670 members another House, which, so far as I am able to gather, may be at least 400 in number, you collect together an enormous public meeting; and your difficulty is not merely the physical difficulty of getting them together, but the intellectual difficulty of carrying on a discussion between the members of a body so enormous. Therefore, in a country like this, where both Houses are large, where the Party system prevails to the extent that it does, and where both Houses are not elected Houses, the system of Joint Sessions&#x2014;although, as
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0397"/>
<col>785</col>
I say, I do not decry it&#x2014;offers difficulties which I think your Lordships ought very carefully to consider before you plunge into it as a definite policy. Your Lordships must also remember that when you speak of a Joint Session much depends upon the numbers of the Upper and more Conservative House I say more Conservative House because, without entering into the question of number or degree, it will, I am sure, be admitted by noble Lords opposite that they mean the Upper House to be Conservative in its complexion. Your Joint Session, in that case, if the relative numbers of the Upper House are very small, may come much nearer to single-Chamber government than the proposals which we are now putting before your Lordships. On the other hand, if the proportionate numbers of the Conservative House are going to be very large, then there would not seem to be very much difference between the future position and that of which we complain to-day.<lb/>
I do not propose on this occasion&#x2014;I do not know whether we may have an opportunity of doing so before the House rises&#x2014;to enter into the question of the Referendum. It is a question which, as everybody knows who has attempted to study it, bristles with difficulties. But here again I would just ask your Lordships to consider this&#x2014;Are you quite sure that the clean-cut operation of the Referendum, with the possibility, in fact, almost the probability, that the question which is asked of the country for that purpose will be couched in a somewhat extreme form&#x2014;are you quite sure that the establishment of the Referendum in this country would make for moderate legislation&#x2014;if that is what you desire&#x2014;to so great an extent as the proposal which we have included in the Parliament Bill?<lb/>
I have not said anything yet about the Preamble of the Bill. Your Lordships are very familiar with the phrase so often spoken in Committee by my noble friend the Lord Chairman, "that the Preamble be postponed." That is what I have done in these few observations. We have always admitted "that the Preamble be postponed" is also our policy. But the postponement of the question of the reform of the House of Lords, either in a speech or as a matter of policy, does not mean, and cannot mean, that we are unmindful of that aspect of the subject. There are
<col>786</col>
more reasons than one why we cannot&#x2014;speaking of ourselves as a Party&#x2014;neglect this question of the reform of the House of Lords. When the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, was speaking last Thursday he stated--though whether he was speaking for the whole of the Party opposite, or even for the Front Bench I am not certain&#x2014;that the Party opposite would not accept this measure and that if it became law, and they came into power later, they would take the first opportunity of reversing it. That is to say, that if the Bill passed through this House in its present state, any scheme of reform winch noble Lords opposite might initiate would be taken, as I understand, as in excuse for adding to the powers of the House something which had been taken away from it by this Bill. If that is so, it is from our point of view a good reason for our attempting to assist in the work of reforming the House while we have some voice in the matter, because in the other event I am quite sure we should have no such voice. Then again, the Bill as it stands provides a further reason for making the reform of your Lordships' House desirable. We do not want to rush legislation through Parliament. We know very well that any attempt so to use the provisions of this Bill&#x2014;even if they could be so used, which I greatly doubt&#x2014;would only recoil upon those who so attempted to use them.<lb/>
As I have said, we desire to substitute delay and revision for hurried Party rejection. Delay and the function of revision mean that you desire the best minds that you can find to be applied to that revision. The theory of this Bill is that the delay and the process of revision will, if the country does not like sonic particular points or provisions in a measure, cause such pressure to be put upon the House of Commons that at its next consideration the measure will have to be modified; and it is quite evident that if such pressure is to be brought to bear, and if it is to be useful pressure, the higher the character, the more brilliant the ability, and the larger the experience of those who sit in the Upper House, the stronger that pressure will be, because the power of ultimate and final rejection does not exist if this Bill becomes law. It would be as wrong to say that the character of the Upper House in these circumstances was no longer of importance, as it would be to say that because a Constitutional Sovereign is not an absolute
 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0398"/>
<col>787</col>
despot therefore his character and capacity are a matter of no importance.<lb/>
There is another point. Some little time ago Mr. F. E. Smith&#x2014;one of the most brilliant, though, I think at times inconvenient supporters of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;stated that in his opinion the measures of both Parties should be given an equal chance of becoming law. We do not attempt anything so ambitious. Our Bill falls far short of Mr. Smith's ideal. Under it our measures will have to go through this dragging process described in our Bill, while yours, I imagine, will go through on the indiarubber tyres on which they have always passed through this House. I quite admit I do not think that is very fair, and if the House of Lords can be so reformed as to afford some check, I do not say as complete a check as this, but at any rate sonic check, to the possible extreme and wild legislation which may be proposed by noble Lords opposite and their friends, and if that can he brought about by some reform of the constitution of the House, that supplies a third reason why this matter of reform ought not to escape our notice. We still maintain the proposal for quinquennial Parliaments&#x2014;that is to say, it is practically only during the first two years of a Parliament, when it may be reasonably supposed, I think, to possess the confidence of the country, that the process by which measures can be made law during the lifetime of a single Parliament will be in practical operation.<lb/>
These are the proposals in the Bill. They have been, as we say, and as we honestly believe, forced upon us by the repeated action of your Lordships' House. It seems to us as if your Lordships had of late years learned what I cannot help thinking is the fatal lesson that it is worth your while to reject our measures on Party grounds in the hope that before they can come up again something may have turned up. It may be a forced election&#x2014;perhaps not altogether a very popular thing in itself. It may be a cycle of bad trade&#x2014;that is all to the good. It may be a wave of unemployment&#x2014;also all to the good. Those things, as we all know, make any Government unpopular. It may be some heavy national expenditure involving new taxation. That again may be expected to make for the unpopularity of a Government. If you can reject our measures some of these things or all of them may
<col>788</col>
turn up, and may give you a chance that our Bills should not become law. As I say, I venture to think that that is a disastrous game to play. It is a game that cannot be played for ever. And, admitting as you do the essential unfairness of the present. condition&#x2014;because it has been admitted in varying degree by members of the Party opposite&#x2014;I cannot think that this House desires to go on playing it indefinitely. But I am bound to say that among the reform proposals which have been brought forward from the other side of the House I have not seen an indication of any which, so far as we are able to judge, would materially alter or amend this state of things. Therefore, in asking the country to support us in the passing of this measure we have to ask&#x2014;I frankly admit it&#x2014;that the matter should be taken out of your hands and that the power to deal with it may be given to us. I only beg the House to believe that we ask this in no factious spirit and we ask it with no desire to lay our ancient institutions in the dust. What we do ask the country to do is to restore a reasonable measure of freedom to the chosen representatives of a free nation.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2&#x00AA;&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Crewe.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02160"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there was one passage, at all events, in the speech which we have just heard to which many of us listened with entire concurrence&#x2014;I mean the opening words of the noble Earl, in which he expressed his acknowledgments to my noble and gallant friend (Lord Roberts) for the manner in which he has removed his notice from the Paper in order to make way for this discussion. It is within the knowledge of all of us that my noble and gallant friend had made the necessary preparations for the debate which was to have taken place this evening many weeks if not many months ago. He would have received a very large amount of support in the House, many Peers having arranged to come here on purpose for the debate, and therefore I think that to the noble and gallant Field-Marshal himself and to his friends and supporters our acknowledgments are due for the manner in which they have consented to stand on one side this evening.<lb/>
I wish, in the next place, to thank the noble Earl for having made a speech at
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0399"/>
<col>789</col>
all this evening. I carry in my mind a memorable occasion on which he moved the Second Reading of a very important measure by a slight and graceful gesture of hand and hat. To-night he has been more indulgent to us and has given us a speech which I think must have seemed to most of your Lordships a very temperate and persuasive speech. I except, perhaps, one or two sentences in his peroration. I venture to say that if we were now commencing a. long discussion, or a long series of Parliamentary discussions, upon this Bill, the speech of the noble Earl would have formed an invaluable introduction or preface to the debate. But the noble Earl forgot that he has warned us off anything like full discussion of this Pleasure. He has forgotten that terse phrase in which lie told us that the Bill would be here for us "to take or to leave." He has forgotten the intimation that any alternative schemes or proposals were not to be regarded as in order for the purposes of this discussion. Well, if that is so, if those are the conditions under which we are to discuss the Parliament Bill, are we greatly assisted by the noble Earl's dissertations upon such subjects as the value of Conferences, the possible use to which joint sittings might be put, or the desirability of having recourse to the Referendum? All these are full of interest to us but when are we going to be allowed to talk about them?<lb/>
We are face to face not only with the announcements of the noble Earl himself, but with an even more striking and memorable announcement which was made to the country on Saturday last by no less a person than the Prime Minister, who told his audience that negotiations were at an end, and that war had begun. How then are we to deal with tins Bill? It is in the view of most of us on this side highly open to criticism, but it contains, nevertheless, the admission of two or three principles which might very well have formed the basis of discussion, if discussion had been permitted&#x2014;I mean the admission that it is necessary to find some machinery for dealing with what we commonly speak of as deadlocks between the two Houses; the admission, which is to be found in the Preamble, that the ultimate settlement of these great Constitutional questions implies that there shall be a reform of the House of Lords; and again, the claim which, within reasonable
<col>790</col>
limits, many of us are inclined to admit, that the other House of Parliament is entitled to a preponderance in the region of what I may call pure finance. There is a certain amount of common ground at these points; and that being so I am under the impression that if a full and free discussion of this Bill had really been open to us, if we had been promised an opportunity of amending the Bill and sending our Amendments down to the House of Commons, a considerable number of your Lordships would have been in favour of giving the measure a Second Reading. I should, I say frankly, have taken upon myself to advise those who might care to know what my opinion was to take that course. The Bill would, in that case, have been thoroughly debated, the House of Commons would have had its opportunity of commenting upon the changes which we recommended, and an attempt would then, no doubt, have been made to arrive at an understanding. The noble Earl very likely will tell me that the kind of course which I had in my mind is altogether too dilatory for himself and his friends. I must say that if that rejoinder is made I am bound to ask your Lordships whether there has ever been in the history of Parliament a case of a Bill of the kind of importance which this Bill possesses being hurried through either House of Parliament within the space of seven days. Our debate, therefore, must, to a certain extent, be an unreal debate, and our criticisms, if we attempt any, must be in a sense perfunctory criticisms, and all that we can do within the time at our disposal is to indicate in general terms the points to which we attach most importance.<lb/>
I will accordingly venture in a very few sentences to tell the House how some of us are struck by the main provisions of the Bill. I take, in the first place, the clauses dealing with the question of finance. Now, I think it is perfectly obvious, whatever one's feelings may be on this point, that the scheme of the Bill is an entirely incomplete and badly thought-out scheme. We may go far in the direction of admitting the preponderance of the House of Commons, where the legislation is purely financial legislation, but we are all of us quite aware that there are many Bills which, although nominally financial measures, in reality are directed to purposes quite other than financial
 <image src="S5LV0006P0I0400"/>
<col>791</col>
purposes. I am speaking, of course, not only of that which is known in the text-books as "tacking"&#x2014;that is what I take it the clause in the Bill is aimed at; but we all of us must have in our minds the case of other Bills in which it cannot be said that the matter complained of is, strictly speaking, foreign to the purpose of the Bill, but of which it can be said with perfect truth that the consequences other than mere financial consequences of the Bill entirely outweigh and over-top the purely financial results.<lb/>
I find in this Bill in the first place what seems to me to be a very inadequate attempt to guard against tacking in the stricter sense of the word. If your Lordships will look at the end of the first clause you will find a definition of a Money Bill which ends with these words&#x2014;
<quote>"Or matters incidental to those subjects or any of them."</quote>
That is a loophole through which any provision, however mischievous and dangerous, could easily find a way. Then to come to the other kind of abuse which many of us desire to guard against. There is no attempt, so far as I can see, in this Bill to deal at all with the more insidious plan of presenting, under the cloak of finance, measures so framed as, for instance, to discriminate unjustly between one set of persons and another&#x2014;to penalise a certain trade, a certain profession, or to bring about great social or political changes. The only safeguard I find against tacking of any kind is the reference of the point to the Speaker of the House of Commons. I desire to express my concurrence in all that was said by the noble Earl as to the respect due to that high official. No one feels that respect more than I do, but what I think we have to remember is that the Speaker of the House of Commons is an official of the House of Commons. He is not in a judicial position as one who might hold the balance or whose business it was to hold the balance between the two Houses of Parliament. His business is to watch over the privilege of the House of Commons and whenever he sees what seems to him an invasion of that privilege to stand up for his own House. If it had been possible to insert in this Bill a provision which really would effectually safeguard us, not only against tacking of the more technical kind, which I attempted to describe, but against
<col>792</col>
tacking in the broader sense, I for one should have been ready to suggest that your Lordships might well forgo the Constitutional right which you at present possess to deal with Money Bills of a purely financial character. The concession would obviously be a considerable one, and it is one which could not be for a moment entertained unless the kind of abuses to which I have referred were effectually guarded against.<lb/>
Then may I say one word as to the clauses dealing not with financial but with ordinary legislation? They seem to me to fall very far short indeed of anything that is due to a self-respecting Second Chamber in a properly balanced Constitution. All that Clause 2 would leave to the House of Lords is an opportunity of interposing comparatively brief delay when it regarded a measure as inexpedient in the public interest. It is true that this House would be given the right of three rejections in two years, but those rejections would take place with the knowledge that there was hanging over us, whatever happened in the third year, the inexorable right of the House of Commons to end all further discussion and to pass the Bill into law over our heads. I noticed in a remarkable speech delivered by the Prime Minister on Saturday last that he apparently attached what I conceive to be a very exaggerated importance to this opportunity of delay winch would be accorded to us. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Where the two Houses differ we provide for such opportunities of Conference and such an interposition of delay as would effectually frustrate any attempt by a scratch majority to rush unpopular legislation out of touch with public opinion."</quote>
I confess that when I read that statement I referred to my copy of the Bill, and I searched it in vain for any mention of the word Conference. But I have no doubt the Prime Minister had in his mind what was said by the noble Earl in his speech just now. The noble Earl evidently contemplates, and I think rightly contemplates, that there would be more frequent and more regularised resort to procedure by Conference, and if that is his view I entirely agree with him, and I agree that such procedure should be made as little rigid and difficult as possible.<lb/>
But, my Lords, just let us consider for a moment on what sort of terms of equality should we confer with the other House of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0401"/>
<col>793</col>
Parliament if it were a part of the Constitution that supposing our Conferences came to nought the Bill was nevertheless to become an Act over our heads. The noble Earl was eloquent upon the value of delay. He said that nothing was more alien to the intentions of his colleagues than that a Bill should be rushed through Parliament&#x2014;if we are to talk of rushing what are we to say of this Bill being rushed through before Monday next?&#x2014;but under the Bill a measure of any magnitude might be sprung upon the country and, let us say, in the second or third year of a Parliament might be passed into law by the sole will of the House of Commons. I wonder whether the noble Earl can point to any precedent for a Second Chamber constituted upon those lines&#x2014;I mean a Second Chamber which discharges its functions upon the understanding that not only the Second Chamber itself but the constituencies are to be of no account and that the sole power is to devolve upon the popular House of Parliament. I believe that you may search precedents in vain for any arrangement which would thus put the entire control over public affairs in the hands of one House. But if a scheme of this kind is, as I believe it to be, full of danger when you are dealing with ordinary legislation, what are we to think and what are we to say when we become aware that the same procedure is to apply even to what I should call capital legislation&#x2014;I mean legislation dealing with the Constitution of the country, dealing with such questions as the disestablishment of the Church and the breaking up of the Union between these islands? Do not let us lose sight of the fact that this danger is not by any means an imaginary one. We know perfectly well, and the noble Earl knows perfectly well, how we stand at this moment with regard to the question of Home Rule for Ireland. The Prime Minister spoke of scratch majorities. He has done so more than once within the last few months, and perhaps not unnaturally, as he lives and has his being under a sense of the inconvenience which may be experienced from a scratch majority.<lb/>
Let me read another sentence spoken by Mr. Asquith early in the present year. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"There were conceivable cases where you have a scratch majority combining under the coercion of Party exigencies for a particular and transient purpose."</quote>
Have we not just seen an announcement
<col>794</col>
by the head of one of the groups upon which His Majesty's Government depends that he has arrived here from America with a large sum of money in his pocket in order to take advantage of Party exigencies and the difficulties of the Government of the day? I ask the noble Earl&#x2014;how would the plan of this Bill do what Mr. Asquith apparently expects it to do, namely, frustrate the operation of a combination of groups, a scratch majority, bent upon taking advantage of the necessities of the Government of the day for a transient purpose? One other word with regard to this portion of the Bill The whole scheme of the Bill is, on the face of it, an interim arrangement. The Preamble looks forward to the time when this House shall be differently constituted, and evidently to a different arrangement in regard to dead-locks when that time shall come. I find in this Bill no indication of the manner in which we are eventually to pass from that interim arrangement to an arrangement of a more permanent and thoroughly thought-out character. That seems to me to be a defect to which attention should be called.<lb/>
I come now to the question which must be present to all our thoughts. Why is it that these violent things are to be done? The noble Earl gave us at the beginning of his speech a recapitulation of what he regarded as the facts of the case. He went back four years to what I will not call the rejection of the Education Bill, but to our inability to come to terms over the Education Bill, and he said that upon that occasion the House of Lords was going against the principles which had been clearly expressed by the country at the General Election. Was that quite the case? What happened w hen His Majesty's Government returned to the charge and resumed their attempt to legislate on the subject of education? Why, the whole of the principles which were supposed to have been affirmed by the country at the General Election were thrown overboard by His Majesty's Government. You had a Bill connected with the name of Mr. McKenna; you had another Bill connected with the name of. Mr. Runciman I think there was a fourth Bill which was under informal discussion but which did not see the light, or, at any rate, did not come to this House. When the noble Earl cites these subsequent
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0402"/>
<col>795</col>
attempts as illustrations of the difficulties interposed by the House of Lords in the way of useful legislation lie forgets that neither the McKenna Bill nor the Runciman Bill ever came near this House. All that those two Bills prove is that His Majesty's Government on consideration thought it desirable to mend their own hand very considerably. Then I come to the Licensing Bill, which I need not discuss at this moment. Assuming that we threw out the Education Bill and the Licensing Bill, does that justify the statement made on Saturday by the Prime Minister that in almost every attempt which the House of Commons made to give effect to the wishes of those who elected it it was systematically thwarted, baffled, and defeated by the House of Lords? I should like to ask the noble Earl how many Bills which the people have really shown any desire to get have the House of Lords thrown out, and how many Liberal measures promoted by His Majesty's Government, some of them very far-reaching measures indeed, have passed into law, not only without opposition by this House, but with all the assistance we could give to make them into good and practicable measures?<lb/>
The Prime Minister is usually conspicuous for the sobriety of his language. On this occasion, it seems to me that he went rather beyond his usual tether, and it is perhaps fortunate that upon the particular occasion on which his speech was delivered the noble Earl opposite, the Minister for Agriculture, was also present in the chair. If I may put it this way, I would say that if the Prime Minister supplied the poison, the noble Earl immediately supplied the necessary antidote. I have read the Prime Minister's words. Now I will read the noble Earl's words. The noble Earl explained that the policy of His Majesty's Government was what he called "a policy of results," and he added that during their five years they had had peace with all its attendant blessings, loyalty and contentment in South Africa, India wisely governed, the maintenance of a magnificent Navy, the creation of an Army&#x2014;he did not say a magnificent Army; I have no doubt he had the fear of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts, in his mind. And then the noble Earl went on to say they had also laid land reform, labour legislation, old-age pensions, and a term
<col>796</col>
perance and people's Budget. And now pray let me invite the attention of the House particularly to the climax&#x2014;
<quote>"Two questions remained to be solved, Home Rule for Ireland and the Education problem Those until quite lately were in the lap of the Lords."</quote>
So that this famous indictment of habitual obstruction is whittled down by the noble Earl to two measures&#x2014;two measures in five years. I would venture to ask him whether he is quite sure that these matters are in the lap of the House of Lords? I do not quite know whose lap the Education Bill is in&#x2014;it has been in a good many different laps&#x2014;but I am quite sure the noble Earl knows, or, if he does not, lie will very soon find out, whose lap the Home Rule measure lies in.<lb/>
I return reluctantly to the question which I put to the House a few moments ago, What is it our duty to do with this Bill? and I come to this conclusion, that all we can do is to avail ourselves of the few remaining days, I might almost say the few remaining hours, which are left to us in order to endeavour to put on record if we can, in a simple form and in an intelligible shape, the proposals which we ourselves would be inclined to lay before the country for the settlement of this part of the question. I say this part of the question because I regard the Resolutions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches as having taken us as far as we can go at present in regard to the question of the constitution of the House of Lords. I thought the Prime Minister, in the same speech, was perhaps rather unduly severe upon my noble friend. He said my noble friend's scheme was to all intents and purposes a "ghost," and then, by a rather splendid confusion of metaphors, lie said, "the parricidal pickaxes" were already at work on the fabric of this House. I do not know how one would operate on a. ghost with parricidal pick-axes. In the leading ghost case, which is to be found in Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, the officer in command of the guard proposed to attack the ghost with a partisan, whatever a partisan is, but I suppose it must be something different from a parricidal pickaxe. But the Prime Minister was not content to leave the matter there. He charged my noble friend and your Lordships' House with doing what he called applying a thin coat of democratic varnish to the "ghost." I must say that any attempt to varnish a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0403"/>
<col>797</col>
ghost would require a considerable amount of ingenuity.<lb/>
The Resolutions which, before our proceedings terminate this evening, I shall venture to lay before the House will, then, have reference not to the question of the constitution of this House, but to the manner in which deadlocks between the two Houses, persistent differences of opinion, might be dealt with. And let me add this observation. We on this side have always been in favour of making some change in our procedure for the purpose of meeting that particular difficulty. I say that because the noble Earl opposite told us the other evening that he had never heard, that lie had not the faintest idea, that that was a part of the case we were interested in. I looked up the speech which I delivered in this House, I think, in March of this year, and I find I then stated as clearly as I possibly could that in our view both questions demanded attention&#x2014;on the one hand the constitution of this House; on the other, the procedure to he resorted to in the case of differences between the two Houses.<lb/>
That is really all I have to say to your Lordships, except this. It seems to be essential that the House should have time to consider the Resolutions which I shall move later in the evening, and I propose, therefore, to move the adjournment of the debate until Wednesday, and that upon that day we should enter upon a discussion of the Resolutions.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02165"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is not entitled to speak again. Perhaps, therefore, though I am a very inadequate substitute, the noble Earl will allow me to answer his question. The proposal which we on this Bench make is that the debate be now adjourned. On Wednesday, if the House permits us, we shall lay before it Resolutions of which my noble friend will give notice to-night. We move that the debate be now adjourned because we are not allowed to discuss this Bill in the ordinary method. The proper way to discuss this Bill, and the only way worthy of your Lordships' House and of the enormous importance of the subject, is to discuss it first upon Second Reading and then upon the subsequent stages. Were that course pursued we should be able to lay before your Lordships' House and before the country, in regular form, the details of the proposals which we think ought to be made in reference to the Government's Bill. The noble Earl has refused to your Lordships the Committee stage of this Bill. We are to be asked Aye or No, and nothing else, upon Second Reading. That is an intolerable position. If we are not allowed to lay our proposals with reference to this Bill in detail before your Lordships after the Second Reading, we will lay them before the Second Reading; and it is not our fault that the usual procedure of Parliament is to be varied. The noble Earl's colleagues in another place have very well known methods, which they freely use, of stopping discussion. Hitherto it has not been possible for the Government to stop discussion here. But it appears that they have thought out a new scheme. Not only is there closure and guillotine in the House of Commons, but then e is to be closure and guillotine in the House of Lords, and the only method open to the Government is the use of the Royal Prerogative and the Dissolution of Parliament. It is our business to see that the country is not misled by a procedure of that kind. It is our business to treat in detail the proposals of the Government, if not after the Second Reading, then before the Second Reading, and my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition has
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0404"/>
<col>799</col>
moved the adjournment of the debate in order that we may have this opportunity, which, if the Government had their way, would be absolutely denied to us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02166"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it must be realised that by the Motion of the noble Marquess the House has been placed in a really remarkable position. Never before in the history of this House has such a Motion been made in such a sudden fashion with regard to an important measure presented by the Government of the day. The complaint which has been made since Friday last by noble Lords opposite is that His Majesty's Government have not given sufficient time for tile discussion of their measure, and now, forsooth, the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition moves a Resolution of closure and guillotine upon this House. The noble Marquess's proposal is that this debate should be closured to-day and that we should meet again on Wednesday in order to discuss the Resolutions which meanwhile he is going to put down on the Paper of the House. I confess that I do not understand the reasons for this delay. We have just been told by the noble Marquess that this matter of the relations between the two Houses is one upon which he has well-considered opinions, and that he has mentioned these opinions already in debate in this House. No longer ago than March last he mentioned what his opinions on that subject were, and yet he is unable to produce Resolutions embracing those opinions before Wednesday next. In this connection there is a very hackneyed expression which so exactly meets the case that I can hardly forbear repeating it, and saying that this is, indeed, a deathbed repentance. For our part we are perfectly ready to go on with the discussion of this subject, and we are surprised that, after the desire so frequently expressed for a discussion of this question, noble Lords opposite should now run away from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02167"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure I express the feeling of every one in this House when I welcome my noble friend who has just sat down in his new character as an &#x00E6;dile at the Table. I only rise to say a word on the Motion for the adjournment. My noble friend is shocked at the unprecedented nature of the Motion. I really do not know whether
<col>800</col>
it is unprecedented or not. I have never been very well versed in precedents, and shall go down to my grave without studying them very carefully. But if this is an unprecedented position whose fault is it? I envy my noble friend his talents and his position in the Government, but much more than all I admire his courage.<lb/>
What has happened with regard to this business? We have been kept chained and mute for the last four, five, or six months under the black shadow of the Conference from which we hoped so much. Now my noble friend the Leader of the House meets the House with an intimation scarcely veiled that we shall have a Dissolution in a few days. Then how does this precious Bill come to us? One would think from the language of my noble friend the aedile that it was put with almost frantic eagerness on the Table of the House by my noble friends opposite What is the case? They never meant to bring it forward at all. It was on the challenge of my noble friend that it was brought forward; it was under the pressure of a majority in this House that it was brought forward. Reluctantly and at the very last moment it was brought in, and brought in in such a way that even if my noble friend had not moved the adjournment there would have been no possibility of adequate discussion.<lb/>
You do not seem to realise what you are doing. You bring in a Bill of this kind with the trivial elegance with which you might introduce a turnpike Act or the mysterious local government measures which are moved by the dozen by some lower official of the Government. What you are attempting to do is none of these things. You are attempting to do away with one estate of the realm without substituting anything in its place. You have the face to tell us that we are acting in an unprecedented manner when in the last four, five, or six dying days of the session you bring forward this Motion without any option to us but to say Yes or No to any of the provisions of the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Marquess behind me quoted a phrase from the remarkable, I might almost say extraordinary, speech delivered by my right hon. friend the Prime Minister at the National Liberal Club on Saturday. I make every allowance for the exuberance
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0405"/>
<col>801</col>
of a speech made under the hospitable auspices of the National Liberal Club, where I have so often enjoyed myself in past days. But I am a little shocked that the noble Marquess did not mark the most significant part of that speech, which was accentuated by my noble friend who spoke last. Tile Prime Minister quoted Dr. Johnson as saying that nothing concentrates a man's mind so much as the knowledge that he is going to be hanged, and he applied the remark to your Lordships' House. My noble friend opposite spoke of a deathbed repentance This is the spirit apparently in which this great Government approaches this vast Constitutional question. They regard the 1 louse of Lords as simply a culprit to be hanged without shrift and without repentance, and only with the rather trite consolations of my noble friend opposite to cheer its last hour. I have always understood that when a man is going to be hanged he has, besides the opportunity of concentration of mind some little mercy shown to him in the disposal of his last moments. He is admitted to certain indulgences. My noble friends opposite, having put on the black cap, are not inclined to any such leniency. We claim that we shall employ the few hours we are told we have to live to the best purpose that, in our judgment, we can, and we will not allow any other necessities to override that which dictates to this ancient Assembly the right to present its own case to the country without being gagged by an ultra-Liberal Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02168"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the question before your Lordships' House at this moment is that this debate be now adjourned. I will only say a very few words on what I call the fringe which the noble Earl added to the point under discussion. He has spoken of our precipitancy and desire to avoid discussion. Let me remind your Lordships what is the history of the question of the reform of the House of Lords and the adjustment of the relations between the two Houses.<lb/>
The noble Earl has been, I admit, a pioneer, a protagonist in this business all his life. He dropped it, I suppose, as an impossible task daring the period of twenty years of Conservative ascendency preceding 1905. In 1905 when a Liberal Government came in the noble Earl took
<col>802</col>
no step. The year 1906 passed. In 1907 Lord Newton brought the matter forward, and the Committee which was appointed reported in December, 1908. Why was nothing said about all these proposals for reform during the year 1909? Lord Newton put down a Motion relating to the subject, but only to one side of it&#x2014;namely, the constitution of the House, and it constantly disappeared from the Paper. It seemed always to vanish. If I were not aware of his want of reverence for the Whips I should have supposed that the Whips had exercised some influence upon him not to bring the matter forward in the year 1909. Your Lordships will remember that at that time a raid was contemplated upon the Budget, and that might not be a convenient time to draw attention to the supposed shortcomings of your Lordships' House; you do not go to confessional just at the time when you are about to stop a mail coach. Why did not the noble Earl himself bring this forward last year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02169"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: If the noble and learned Lord wishes to know I will tell him why. The noble and learned Lord seems to be better versed in the matter than the Prime Minister, who appeared to think that we had never embarked upon a discussion of this matter until last week. I did not bring forward the Report of the Committee because I thought it was rather for the majority of the Committee, with whom I did not wholly agree, to take that step.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02170"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: That is an explanation of the conduct of the noble Earl. Why did nobody else bring it forward? I am not speaking <i>in personam</i> towards the noble Earl. I am discussing what he has put forward now to the effect that the Government are responsible for not giving adequate time to this House to discuss the question. The whole of last year was available for the purpose, and no noble Lord who took an interest in the subject brought it forward. The noble Earl did not bring forward until a comparatively recent time proposals relating to the constitution of the House. He has not at any time brought forward proposals relating to the adjustment of the relations between the two Houses, which I understand he thinks an essential ingredient in a final settlement.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0406"/>
<col>803</col>
The fact of the matter is, we have had experience during the last five years which has led us to the conviction that we cannot ourselves usefully carry on the business of this country while the relations between the two Houses remain as they are. We have brought forward Bill after Bill and have been disappointed to find them successively rejected by your Lordships' House. It is necessary, in my humble opinion, and that of the Government, that this thing should come to an end one way or another, and that we should either cease to be Ministers of the Crown or that we should be endowed with powers which we do not possess. If now we were to protract this discussion and proceed on the lines of the Resolutions of the noble Earl or the yet unseen proposals of the noble Marquess, we should be embarking on a very long journey indeed, and it might be twelve months before we came to any conclusion. It is necessary that this thing should be settled one way or another. If it is settled adversely to us we shall willingly quit office; if it is settled in our favour we shall then be able to carry into effect the projects and the policy upon which our hearts are set.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02171"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the question before the House is whether this debate shall be adjourned and I shall endeavour to keep myself strictly to that point. If I may venture to say so, I think part of the speech of the noble Lord at the Table and the answer of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack are beside the particular question which we have in hand to-night. There are two great branches of this question&#x2014;the constitution of this House, and the relations between the two Houses. We are concerned to-night with a Bill which refers only to the relations between the two Houses. It is because that important Bill has been brought forward at such a time as this that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has taken the course which he has proposed. It is no use to twit us with not having brought forward at an earlier date proposals from this side to regulate the relationship between the two Houses and the powers of this House. We were obviously bound to wait until the Bill of the Government was before us. The noble Earl himself, in his introduction of the Bill, detailed the history showing how those Resolutions in one form or another had been before the other House
<col>804</col>
of Parliament for some years, but during the whole time that those Resolutions were before the other House there was the condition precedent that they were to be incorporated in a Bill and that the Bill was to be brought before Parliament for consideration and discussion. I say this House was bound to wait until the Government had brought forward their Bill dealing with this part of the question. No one was more astonished than I was to hear that there was to be a Dissolution upon the question&#x2014;apparently, as the Government think, upon that question largely by itself&#x2014;before they had afforded this House an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon those proposals.<lb/>
I venture to think that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition did a reasonable and right thing in challenging the Government to bring forward the proposals in this House in order that we might discuss them in an intelligent way. But in promising to bring the Bill forward the noble Earl the Leader of the House announced that we were to have no opportunity of discussing it in detail, that it must be practically taken or left. I understood to-night that there was an indication that on one or two minor points Amendments might be accepted. But look at the position in which this House has been placed. No more important question could possibly be brought forward, and we are expected in four or five days, not only to get through the Second Reading stage, but also the Committee stage of the Bill with the certainty announced to us that anything we do of any importance in Committee will be taken no notice of. It seems to me that the course taken by the noble Marquess is a reasonable one, because it avoids on the one hand committing this House prematurely to the Second Reading of the Bill without an opportunity of amending it, and yet enables us, even though it may be at a late hour, to put forward the proposals which would have been put forward as alternative to those of the Government if we had had the ordinary power of discussing the Bill in Committee. That seems to me, in the difficult circumstances in which we have been placed mainly by the action of the Government in announcing the Dissolution as they did, a way out of the difficulty.<lb/>
This is not the time to discuss the Bill itself, but perhaps I might make this
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0407"/>
<col>805</col>
remark&#x2014;that I believe the Preamble to the Bill to be wholly without precedent. It is generally supposed that the Preamble to a Bill leads up to the contents of a Bill. This Preamble is quite a different thing. If you look at the two clauses of the Preamble you will see that&#x2014;
<quote>"it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular &#x2026; basis."</quote>
and then they go on&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas provision will require hereafter to be made by Parliament &#x2026;"</quote>
The ordinary course of a Preamble is to prepare the way for what is in the Bill itself, not what is to be at some future time, more or less of a nebulous character. If a Preamble of this kind appeared in a Private Bill it would be struck out under the Standing Orders of the House, and there is neither sense, nor reason, nor precedent for the insertion of such a Preamble as this in a Bill of this kind. It arouses the suspicion in our minds, at any rate in my mind, that the Preamble was an afterthought, that it was inserted for the sake of saving the face or salving the conscience of sonic members of the Government who are not very happy in regard to the policy which is announced in their name. I conclude by saying that, in view of the ultimatum that was issued to us the other day that we could take this Bill if we liked, we could leave it if we liked, but we were not to amend it, it seems to me that the noble Marquess has taken a wise, reasonable, and. statesmanlike course, and one for which, I think, the House owes him a great debt of gratitude.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02172"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may be allowed to say so, it seems to me that your Lordships have not before you so intimately as those who sit on this Bench the difficult position which we hold in this House. It is not unnatural, I think, that the Government should be somewhat surprised at the turn which this debate has taken. It is very present to the minds of those who represent His Majesty's Government in this House that the Bill is in the hands of the House to deal with as the House may choose. We have no power on this Bench to prevent the House reading the Bill a second time or refusing it a Second Reading, nor is it in our power to prevent the House proceeding to discuss the further stages of the Bill. It is more than evident,
<col>806</col>
however, to us on this Bench that your Lordships do not mean to accord this Bill that treatment. It is clear to us that you prefer to close this discussion on the Bill and proceed to discuss the Resolutions which the noble Marquess opposite has announced his intention of placing on the Paper. That being the case, it is necessary that it should be said that to the Government it is of no really serious consequence which method your Lordships choose to take in discussing this subject. You prefer to discuss the subject on your own Resolutions, which are to deal specifically with this branch of this great question and not with the other branch, the reform of the constitution of this House; but it cannot be mistaken by us that your action in this matter is equivalent to the rejection of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02173"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before saying a word on the speech which fell from the lips of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, I wish at once to contradict in the most categorical manner the interpretation put upon the Motion of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition by the noble Lord opposite. The Motion to adjourn the debate does not mean the rejection of the Bill. I will come presently to explain to the House why we have been forced to the line of action which we have thought it our duty to take. But fist of all I would like to refer to something that fell from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. I think my noble friend Lord Balfour answered fairly as to the delays which the Lard Chancellor said had taken place. I am perfectly prepared to be frank with the noble and learned Lord. I do not think the record of either House or of either Party in years gone by is what it might have been on this question of the reform of the House of Lords and the relations of the two Houses. I think valuable time has gone by when this matter might have been adjusted in calmer atmosphere, but I do claim that where both Parties and both Houses are to blame the lesser blame lies on this House and on the Party to which I belong, because we have taken steps in this matter when the House of Commons was silent and ventilated the question when noble Lords opposite would give us no assistance. Indeed I would remind your Lordships that the noble Earl who leads the House himself admitted the other night, when
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0408"/>
<col>807</col>
twitting this House upon having too much neglected that side of the question which refers to the relations of the two Houses, that the House of Commons had entirely neglected that side of the problem which refers to the constitution of your Lordships' House, and with the House of Commons the Government of which he is so distinguished a member.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack spoke with genuine warmth on this matter; his feelings, I know, are deep and sincere, as are those of his colleagues on the Bench opposite; but our feelings are no less deep and sincere. I am afraid there does lie before us what was only too well described by the Leader of the House as a heated controversy, but surely the Lord Chancellor a little exaggerated, even from the point of view presented by his own colleagues, the influence which this House has exercised on the policy of the Government. The noble and learned Lord spoke of measure after measure which was desired by the people of this country being rejected by your Lordships' House, yet we have heard only to-night that the noble Earl opposite boasted on Saturday&#x2014;and it was a proud boast for a Party leader to make&#x2014;that there were only two subjects on which the Government had not been able to give effect to the will of the people&#x2014;Home Rule and the settlement of the Education controversy. I think my noble friend behind me was justified in reminding the noble Earl opposite that as to those subjects we desire nothing more than that they should be subjected to the definite decision of the people.<lb/>
I should like to explain exactly why we take the course of which my noble friend has given notice. The Motion before the House is that this debate should be adjourned. We have been asked, "Why adjourn the debate? It has only just begun, and it is open to you to say what you choose and present your views in whatever way you choose." The reason we take this course is that the debate is not a genuine debate. I can only describe it as a farce. Let me remind your Lordships of the words that fell from the Prime Minister in another place on the 18th of this month. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not, in the stage matters have now reached, a question of amendment or transformation. It is a question of acceptance or rejection as a whole."</quote>
<col>808</col>
Not a single Amendment is to be made, even if it is one that commends itself to the general public opinion. How can we go through the farce of putting down Amendments to which noble Lords opposite would listen with civil and courteous demeanour, but none of which, though admirable they might say as abstract propositions, could be accepted, as the Bill is sacrosanct? We are not going to be parties to acting in such a farce.<lb/>
What we desire is to take our part in enabling public opinion to form itself as to the methods of settling the question; and before we proceed with the Second Reading we wish to put down in as clear a manner as the limited time at our disposal allows the alternatives which we believe will commend themselves to the people of the country as alternatives which will give the great Party which noble Lords opposite represent what they ask for&#x2014;namely, a fair balance in the Constitution as between the two Parties and the two Houses, but which will not in the process destroy one House altogether. When my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition was describing how the provisions of the Parliament Bill, if they became law, might operate, he omitted to point out one very significant fact, that the House of Commons might in the course of one or two Sessions become restive under the delay of two years. The Second Chamber would exist as a painted figment for the contentment of fools, who might believe a Second Chamber really sat here. But two years, when you are dealing with ardent and hardened legislators, who are going to reform heaven and earth and all that is under the earth, is a long time to interpose between a cherished project and its realisation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02175"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I am endeavouring to state the reason why we have moved the adjournment of the debate.

it would become obvious, as it must have been to all reasonable people at the beginning, that there would be no remaining utility in your Lordships' House. To the plan of the Government we have an alternative. It is this alternative which my noble friend has embodied in certain Resolutions of which he proposes to give notice to-night. Surely it is reasonable that members of the House should have one day to study Resolutions of such importance, and therefore we ask that they should be taken on Wednesday. The House will then have before it, on the one hand, the scheme of the Parliament Bill, and, on the other hand, the alternatives of the Opposition, which we should not be allowed to press to success in Committee on the Bill because the Prime Minister has said it is a question of acceptance or rejection.</membercontribution></p>

"That in the opinion of this House it is desirable that provision should be made for settling differences which may arise between the House of Commons and this House, reconstituted and reduced in numbers in accordance with the recent Resolutions of this House.<lb/>
<col>810</col>
"That as to Bills other than Money Bills, such provision should be upon the following lines:&#x2014;<lb/>
If a difference arises between the two Houses with regard to any Bill other than a Money Bill in two successive Sessions, and with an interval of not less than one year, and such difference cannot be adjusted by any other means, it shall be settled in a Joint Sitting composed of members of the two Houses.<lb/>
Provided that if the difference relates to a matter which is of great gravity, and has not been adequately submitted for the judgment of the people, it shall not be referred to the Joint Sitting, but shall be submitted for decision to the electors by Referendum.<lb/>
"That as to Money Bills, such provision should be upon the following lines:&#x2014;<lb/>
The Lords are prepared to forego their constitutional right to reject or amend Money Bills which are purely financial in character.<lb/>
Provided that effectual provision is made against tacking; and<lb/>
Provided that, if any question arises as to whether a Bill or any provisions thereof are purely financial in character, that question be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, with the Speaker of the House of Commons as Chairman, who shall have a casting vote only.<lb/>
If the Committee hold that the Bill or provisions in question are not purely financial in character, they shall be dealt with forthwith in a Joint Sitting of the two Houses."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02188">Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Beauchamp</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02189"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will remember that when this House separated in the summer
<col>812</col>
there was, I will not call it a debate, but a conversation in respect of this Bill. I think the noble Earl moved the Second Reading of the Bill on the very last working day of those sittings, and I ventured to ask him whether he could not go more into detail on that occasion and describe to us what the provisions of the Bill were intended to effect and what authority he had for those provisions. The noble Earl &#x2014;I make no complaint, for it was not a suitable opportunity&#x2014;was not able to go into the matter to any extent. at all at that moment. I have no desire whatever to stop this Bill, but I do think that your Lordships are entitled to a little information upon it.<lb/>
There are two questions which I would venture to put to the noble Earl. In the first place, can he inform us in what way, under the working of the Bill, the Government intend to employ the services of the various voluntary bodies which have been at work on this subject for years past. The object of this Bill, as I need not remind your Lordships, is of the highest importance. The Bill is designed to promote apprenticeship, to promote the employment of young persons. I believe this to be a matter of the greatest importance to the country, and with the general object of the Bill I suspect everybody listening to me is in agreement. But I want to know to what extent the Government are going to avail themselves of the assistance of the voluntary bodies which have been at work on this subject. In the second place, I wish to ask whether the various Offices of the Government are thoroughly satisfied with the provisions of this Bill. The noble Earl who was until recently Lord President of the Council moved the Bill on behalf of the Board of Education, but there is another Office which is at least equally interested with the Board of Education in this subject&#x2014;namely, the Board of Trade. I am naturally more interested from the Board of Trade side, and I want to know whether the Board of Trade, which, of course, is the Office primarily concerned with the Labour Exchanges, is thoroughly satisfied with the provisions of the Bill.<lb/>
There is only one further observation I desire to make. I have already said that the last day of the last sittings of Parliament was not a good opportunity for discussing the Bill. I think to-night is a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0411"/>
<col>813</col>
worse opportunity. It is impossible, in the midst of the gravest Constitutional crisis of our times, with a Dissolution of Parliament pending in a few days, for us to give any real attention to this Bill, and I cannot pretend that I think your Lordships will have done your absolute duty in that proper revision and consideration of the provisions of this Bill which the importance of the subject demands. Therefore if those of us who sit on this side of the House do not ask for further time, which would, of course, be fatal to the Bill, on the present occasion, and in view of its great importance allow it to go through, I hope it will be understood that we are not committed to the details of the Bill, and it may well be that on a future occasion and in a future Parliament it may be necessary to carefully revise them and add amendments which there is no time to consider now. But subject to that saving clause, for my own part, and I believe I speak for my friends on this Bench, we shall not in any way oppose the passage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02190"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that my noble friend on the. Front Opposition Bench has taken this opportunity, on the Motion to go into Committee, of putting to the Government the two questions which he has asked. I have ventured to put down an Amendment for the purpose of raising a point which the Education Committee of the County Councils Association specially wish to be raised before this Bill passes into law&#x2014;namely, that this is another of those Bills which put a charge upon the rates in respect of national services while offering no relief out of national funds. I have been in the unfortunate position of having to bring this subject before the House on repeated occasions, and no one could be more sorry than I am to have to do so; but my action has been due to the fact that the Government, and especially the President of the Board of Education, invariably show an almost callous disregard of the rights and wishes of the ratepayers.<lb/>
In this case let me add that I think the President of the Board shows a cynical disregard of what I believe to be the wishes of the Government as a whole. I venture to make that remark because only a few months ago the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in receiving a deputation from the County Councils Association, expressed
<col>814</col>
himself in full accord. with everything that was said. He admitted that it was a gross injustice that these charges should be continually put on the rates, and he declared his intention on the first opportunity, which he then said was to be next year, of putting a stop to it and finding a large sum of money to relieve the rates. Not only that, but the noble Earl who leads this House a very few days afterwards corroborated the statement that was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the deputation to which I have referred, and himself said that it was the intention of the Government next year, if possible, at all events at a very early date, to take into consideration the question of the burden of local rates. I give full credit to the Government for their intention, but I ask, Is it not a somewhat cynical course to pursue to put a new charge on the rates on every occasion you possibly can and at the same time say you are quite in sympathy with those who object to it, and that you are going to take an opportunity at sonic future time to remedy the grievance?<lb/>
I can remember five or six occasions on which, for different purposes in connection with education during the last two or three years, fresh charges have been put on the rates, the only variation in those cases being that the charges have been made by the Board of Education by memoranda, by circulars, or by regulations, over which Parliament has no control and to which the local authorities have to bow. In this case, however, the proposal is contained in a Bill and therefore conies before Parliament, and I venture to take this opportunity of saying that the Government, having expressed their intention of remedying the present serious state of things, might surely have held their hands during the last few days of an expiring Parliament from further adding to what they admit to be the unjust burden already borne by the ratepayers. I did hear, though not from any official source, that the Minister for Education would be willing to consider whether this charge might not be met in sonic way out of the funds at the disposal of the Government. I have placed on the Paper an Amendment which I have no doubt I shall be told is a privilege Amendment. We have had privilege Amendments on different occasions in this House which have been treated differently by the other House, and I cannot forget
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0412"/>
<col>815</col>
that a series of privilege Amendments were moved in this House with regard to a Bill for giving pensions to lunatic asylum officers, and that they were moved really at the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. I do not wish to press an Amendment of this sort, particularly on the present occasion, but I do hope that the effect of my having put the Amendment on the Paper will he that, if the Bill is not to be amended in this way, we may, at all events, get some assurance that the President of the Board of Education will take care that this Bill does not place anything like a serious charge on the rates.<lb/>
I am quite unable to say what amount of money will have to be spent for the purposes of this Bill if the county councils carry it out. Let me point out that this is not a compulsory Bill; it gives county councils power to undertake this work. But I understand that the President of the Board of Education is extremely anxious that the Bill should be effective, and I venture to suggest that if he wishes it to be carried out by county councils who are already smarting under the continuous charges that are put upon them by the Board of Education, his wish would be facilitated if he would undertake the charge himself, or, at all events, see that a considerable part of the charge is recouped to county councils out of Government funds. I hope I have put our case in a reasonable and moderate way, and I shall be glad if the Government can give some assurance which will relieve the feelings of the ratepayers in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02191"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am extremely anxious that this Bill should pass. I believe that that is the general wish of those authorities on whom the additional expense, if any, would fall&#x2014;namely, the local education authorities&#x2014;and I fancy that the county councils in so far as they have education committees are also favourable to the Bill. This Bill is brought forward merely to clear up a doubt which has arisen. It was the common practice for School Boards to help children to get employment on leaving school by means of correspondence and otherwise, and all who were familiar with the system will acknowledge that a very valuable work was carried out. I do not know any body more able to help in this matter than the school authorities,
<col>816</col>
or any body to which an employer is more apt to apply. The noble Earl who represents the Board of Trade will give an authoritative assurance to the noble Marquess on the point, but I understand that this Bill has the absolute support of the Board of Trade and of the Board of Education.<lb/>
I understand that the noble Lord below the Gangway opposite (Lord Belper) wished to put on record a protest or warning rather than to actually go to a Division against the Bill; but my opinion is that the cost which the carrying out of the provisions of this Bill would involve would be quite infinitesimal. We are to have the large question of the relation of the State to the rates considered next year. At any rate it is on the list, though one must be a sanguine man to feel sure that everything that is on the list for next year will be dealt with. But I hope that something will be done. I only rose to state that this is a thing that was commonly done by the old School Boards, but that people are not quite clear whether they have the power now to do it without legislation. Therefore it is well that the doubt should be cleared up. With regard to the <i>caveat</i> entered by the noble Marquess opposite, I may say that personally I shall be glad to support the noble Marquess in remedying by legislation any practical defects which may be found in the working of this measure. I hope, however, that we may with a happy unanimity agree to this Bill to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02192"><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to amplify the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Belper. The London County Council, of which I am a member, have considered this Bill and are strongly of opinion that this is really a matter which should properly be paid for by the Imperial Government. Lord Belper has referred to a promise given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and also to a speech made by the noble Earl the Leader of this House, but the London County Council feel that it is possible that this Bill may prejudice their position and the position of other local bodies when this question comes up for settlement on a future occasion. There is another point which strengthens the case of local bodies against the Government in this matter. I think every member of the House will agree that this is really an extension of the principle of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0413"/>
<col>817</col>
the Labour Exchanges Act of last year. So much so is that the case that a Regulation&#x2014;Regulation No. 9, I think it is&#x2014;drawn up under that Act gives power for committees to be formed and arrangements made with respect to the employment of children, and a whole list of rules have been made under that Regulation. It is perfectly true that the work may be better carried on by the Board of Education in the schools than perhaps it could be by the Board of Trade, and possibly also more economically. But that hardly meets the objection. It is merely an extension of the principle of the Labour Exchanges Act, but the work is to be done by another body. All that it does is to save the Board of Trade from having to spend money as they would have to do under their regulations and rules. In view of that fact the London County Council have passed this Resolution&#x2014;
<quote>"That in the opinion of this Council the expenses incurred by the local education authorities in the exercise of their powers under the Education (Choice of Employment)) Bill should be defrayed out of the Imperial Exchequer."</quote>
There are two points that might be urged by the noble Earl against that resolution. The first is that the duties under this Bill are optional. If the Government really consider that the provisions of the Bill are desirable, surely it is for them to encourage the local authorities to put the Bill into force when it becomes law. London has, perhaps, a particularly strong claim in this matter, because already the Board of Trade have appointed a special Advisory Committee on Juvenile Employment under the Labour Exchanges Act of last year. There is another point that may be urged&#x2014;namely, that a local authority may have very wide views about the provisions of this Bill and may spend far more money than the Treasury would be prepared to sanction. But no one suggests that the local authorities should be given <i>carte blanche</i> to act in this matter. All that is urged upon His Majesty's Government is that in this case the grant from the Exchequer shall be adequate to the work being carried out in a thoroughly satisfactory and economical manner. There have been several cases of late in which duties have been put upon local authorities and a grant made, but it has been quite impossible for the duties to be carried out, however economically, without very largely exceeding the expenditure which the grant
<col>818</col>
would cover. I venture to hope that the noble Earl in charge of this Bill will be able to give some assurance to the House that the local authorities will be given a grant sufficient to carry out to the full the provisions of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02193"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will not look upon it as a trifling matter whether we pass this measure or not. It matters extremely that we should at this moment give the facilities which this Bill offers. All those who are engaged in the practical work of the education of older children know that this Bill is really needed, and I do not think we should be wrong in saying that, to whatever authority you choose to turn who is familiar with the working of the upper classes of our schools and the finding of proper outlets for boys and girls on leaving those schools, no one can fail to say that something of this sort is urgently required. Without aid of the kind suggested by this Bill this work cannot be done properly, but with aid of this sort the work will turn out a far-extending boon in preventing boys and girls drifting into what is called blind-alley employments, which come to nothing at all and unfit them for anything in after life. Besides that, no one who has to do with the working of our elementary schools can fail to be aware that boys and girls frequently show, after a very few years, that they and their employments have been what we may call misfits. By a kind of accident they have got into the wrong employment when they might have got into the right one, and this is due to the lack of some authority or of some set of persons or office to w hick they might turn for the kind of counsel and aid they most require.<lb/>
The carrying out of this work may, of course, involve some expenditure, but the greater part of the work will be done voluntarily. Expenditure will be involved in seeing that it is practically and effectively done, but it is not a thing that will mount up into large machinery involving a great deal of money. Voluntary aid will supplement it, and those most admirable and kindly helpers, the head teachers in our great elementary schools, will find themselves assisted in every way to carry out more effectively the sort of work they are trying to do to the best of their ability now. We have heard two important and
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0414"/>
<col>819</col>
interesting speeches to-night from Lord Belper and Lord Stanhope as to the financial question and the difficulties which may be raised. I was particularly interested in the speech of my noble friend Lord Stanhope, who seemed to me to thoroughly understand the subject and to see where the difficulty would lie.<lb/>
I share with the noble Marquess opposite and others a desire that if it is found that some change in the administration of the Bill or in the incidence of its cost is necessary the matter may be remedied, and I feel that we who are cordially supporting the Bill to-night will be foremost in desiring to co-operate in bringing in any such change. There may be difficulties to cope with as regards the working out of the measure and even the small expense involved, but do not let us in consequence of these difficulties neglect to take a step the postponement of which would cause great disappointment in all parts of the country, and the taking of which by your Lordships to-night would be, I am certain, appreciated by those who care most for the well-being at the critical age of the boys and girls in our elementary schools. I therefore hope that your Lordships will go into Committee to-night and pass the Bill without amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02194"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be convenient to your Lordships that I should at this stage answer the question put to me by the noble Marquess opposite as to the attitude of the Board of Trade with regard to this Bill. I am glad to be able to say that the Board of Trade and the Board of Education are in entire agreement on this matter. Several conferences have taken place between the two Departments, and they see no reason whatever to think that there will be any fear of overlapping between the Juvenile Department of the Labour Exchanges and the local education authorities in the event of this Bill becoming law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02195"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend the Lord President of the Council is unable to be in his place to-day to conduct the passage of this Bill through Committee of your Lordships' House, and as I am acting for him perhaps it would be convenient that I should now answer the various questions which have been put. In the first place, I will reply to the
<col>820</col>
remarks of the noble Marquess on the Front Bench opposite. If he will refer to <i>Hansard</i> he will see that, as a matter of fact, a little more time was given to your Lordships for the consideration of this Bill than he seems to think. My recollection is that the noble Marquess was not present in your Lordships' House on the Second Reading of the Bill, and was therefore unable to hear the no doubt inadequate reasons and explanations which I offered for the Bill. He came in, however, on the day when we were taking the Committee stage, and was anxious, I think, that more time should be given. From what he said just now I was led to the conclusion that his recollection was that we tried to take both stages on the one day, which was not the case. We put off the Committee stage in deference to a request from the noble Marquess, and I had hoped that before now the Bill would have become law.<lb/>
In reply to the two questions which the noble Marquess put, I may say at once that we hope to make every possible use of the voluntary bodies, but it is difficult, to lay down exactly by rule or regulation in what way use can be made of voluntary bodies of this kind. We wish to consult them and so on, but we do not feel that a, definite rule saying how it is to be done would be of material assistance. Voluntary bodies often have to be treated in different ways, and the communications which will take place will frequently be of a somewhat informal character; but both the Board of Education and the Board of Trade are in every way anxious to encourage local education authorities to use voluntary service to the fullest extent, and the good results which have occurred in the past in places where work of this character has been done is an excellent reason why the Board of Education and the Board of Trade should be anxious to, encourage further work of the kind by voluntary bodies.<lb/>
I may say, in reply to the second question of the noble Marquess, that there has been a good deal of consultation between the President, of the Board of Trade and the President of the Board of Education with regard to this matter, and that we are anxious that the Bill should furnish security for the fullest co-operation between the education authorities and the Labour Exchanges. It was in accordance with a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0415"/>
<col>821</col>
suggestion which came from the Board of Trade that provision was included in Clause 1, subsection (1), providing that the powers conferred on the local authorities should only be exercised "subject to the approval of the Board of Education."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02196"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am sure it will shorten matters if the noble Earl will allow me to interrupt him at this point. From the tenor of his argument I should have thought lie would have led up to a provision that the powers conferred should only be exercised "subject to the approval of the Board of Trade." The Bill proposes to confer powers on the education authorities, and the noble Earl was explaining to the House that that was to be done in strict conformity with the Labour Exchanges Act and with the authority of the Board of Trade. Then one would have expected that the words in the clause would have been "subject to the approval of the Board of Trade," not to the approval of the Board of Education.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02197"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I understood the noble Marquess to ask whether the Board of Trade and the Board of Education were in complete agreement in this matter, and I was endeavouring to explain to him how the communications between the two authorities had led to the insertion of these words in the Bill to secure the harmonious co-operation on which the noble Marquess dwelt. As a result, the words which were considered at one time to be necessary and which were suggested as an Amendment in another place directed to this object were, after due consideration, thought unnecessary because provision had already been inserted in the Bill. I can also, through the assistance of my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland, refer the noble Marquess to the reference to this matter in the Education (Scotland) Act, 1908, where power of this kind is given to the local education authorities. My noble friend permits me to say that experience in Scotland has shown that it has worked with excellent results.<lb/>
Then I come to the speech of Lord Belper, who referred to the question of an increase in the rates. I am afraid that I have very little to add to what I have said before on this subject. The noble Lord himself referred to the fact that His Majesty's Government had expressed their
<col>822</col>
hope to deal with the question of rating upon an early occasion. That, of course, touches rather the general question. On the particular Bill now before the House, I may say that the President of the Board is prepared to approach the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view to obtaining financial assistance for the authorities to the extent of part, at least, of the burden which will fall upon them, but it is not very likely that any considerable expense will be incurred. After all, consultation between various authorities does not mean much expenditure, and, valuable as the-results of this Bill will be, I hope it will be exercised with due economy. That, I think, is a special reason why we should wish the expense to be partly borne by the local authority. I am sure the noble Lord will agree with me that in any case where a local authority spends money, where the expenditure of the money is under their charge, it is desirable that they should be responsible for at any rate part of the expense; otherwise there is always a certain tendency to extravagance If a local authority feels that, however great their expense may be, the burden of that expense will be borne by the central authority, one of the greatest incentives to economy is removed. This is especially a matter in which local knowledge is necessary, and I think noble Lords and the most rev. Primate will agree that it is very desirable that it should be done by the local authorities, on account of the knowledge which they have of the special circumstances of particular districts. That, I am afraid, must also be my answer to my noble relative on the Back Benches opposite with regard to the expense. We, naturally, regret that the London County Council are unable to support this Bill entirely and absolutely, but, none the less, we feel confident that when it is passed they will do their best to make it a useful measure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02207">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the noble Earl the First Commissioner of Works has given a pledge that the Board of Education will find at least half the expense of carrying out this measure. I quite recognise that it is difficult to ascertain at the present moment whether the expense is likely to be large or small. No doubt the work should be carried out locally under the authority of the county council or other council concerned, and I recognise fully&#x2014;it is almost an axiom of local government &#x2014;that where the local authority has the administration of work of this sort it is desirable that some part at all events of the cost should fall upon them. But what I venture to ask is whether, in the circumstances of the pledge which the noble Earl has given, he will insert in the
<col>824</col>
Bill at a later stage words which will carry out that pledge&#x2014;namely, that half, at least, of the cost will be borne by the central authority. If he will do that, I shall be quite willing to withdraw my Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02208"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the noble Lord is rather hopeful with regard to the pledge which I gave, and which I do not think went quite so far as he desired. I am sorry that I cannot meet his wishes more in that direction. As to the insertion of further Amendments in this Bill, I hope your Lordships will not insist upon that course, because it is obvious that the only chance the Bill has of passing is that it should go through this House to-day unamended. The insertion of any Amendment here would mean its return to another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02209"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: I am placed in rather a difficult position, but I accept the pledge given in this House by the noble Earl and will rely upon its being carried out. I have no wish to do anything to cause the Bill to be lost. It is unfortunate that it has come up at such a late period, but in the circumstances, and recognising that the noble Earl has met me in the way suggested, I will not move my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02210"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I desire to prevent any misunderstanding. As I understand, Mr. Runciman has communicated, or is in course of communicating, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view to pressing upon him the desirability of meeting a part of this charge. That and nothing more was the promise given by the noble Earl to-night&#x2014;that the Board of Education are endeavouring to get some contribution under this head from the Treasury. I have only referred to this matter to prevent any charge being afterwards made of breach of faith. The noble Earl said that the President of the Board of Education was approaching the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject of obtaining definite assistance, but he said nothing beyond that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02211"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: With all respect to the noble Lord who has just sat down and who is a great authority on education, I think we might leave the noble Earl the First Commissioner to answer himself. The exact pledge which the noble Earl has made he will, of course, absolutely
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0417"/>
<col>825</col>
adhere to. I am afraid, however, that I did not catch what it was. Perhaps the noble Earl will oblige your Lordships by repeating what he said on this point. I understand from Lord Belper that the noble Earl, speaking on behalf of the Government, said that if they have the opportunity of carrying out their pledge, which is not quite certain, in the next Parliament, they will see that half of the cost under this Bill falls upon the Imperial Exchequer.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02214"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I do not refer to the calling of any one to order, but to the evident desire of noble Lords opposite not to hear us on the general question.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02215"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask how the local authorities are to interpret that pledge when they go before the auditor. It is no use for them to quote speeches made in Parliament and pledges given by noble Lords opposite, because the auditor will at once say that there is nothing on the point embodied in the Act. I should be glad to know if, when charges have to be met by my county council, I may point to what the noble Earl in charge of the Bill has said&#x2014;that half of the charge is to be defrayed by the Imperial Exchequer.

<title>RAT PLAGUE IN EAST ANGLIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02220"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose to ask whether, for the more effective destruction of rats in the plague-infected districts of East Anglia, the Local Government Board, as the chief authority, will not itself take steps for their extermination or else induce the local authorities concerned to adopt concerted measures under expert scientific guidance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02221">The noble Lord said: My Lords, having had experience of the difficulty of destroying rats in the plague-infected city of Bombay, I put this Question on the Paper for, so far as I could judge from the newspaper reports, there seemed to be a lack of co-ordination on the part of the authorities in their effort to get rid of the rats in East Anglia. Since putting down my Question I have noticed that fresh regulations have been issued by the Local Government Board. These regulations in some degree meet my objection, but I still have considerable doubt on the subject, and my doubts have been reinforced by seeing an appeal in <i>The Times</i> to-day on behalf of the Royal Institute of Public Health, asking for money to get rid of rats and other vermin. Perhaps the noble Lord who will answer me will say what are the methods adopted, and whether the central authority and the local authorities are co-operating together in this matter. If they are not, their efforts are in vain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02222"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, who has had experience of plague and the extermination of rats in India, has, I think, shown justifiable anxiety that efficient steps should be taken to prevent the spread of disease in the districts of East Anglia. In his Question the noble Lord rather suggests that the Local Government Board might turn rat-catchers, or, at all events, that the Board itself should superintend the extermination of rats. Whilst the Local Government Board are of opinion that a campaign against rats should be of a local character, I think I can, without going into all the details of their procedure, show the noble Lord that the Board are fully alive to their responsibility ill the matter of public health, that they have not been slow to press upon the local authorities concerned the necessity of adopting proper methods, and that they have, in fact, from the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0418"/>
<col>827</col>
outset provided them with guidance and advice.<lb/>
The matter was first brought to the notice of the Local Government Board on October 3. Four cases of suspected plague in East Suffolk were reported to the Board on that date, and Dr. Bulstrode, the Medical Inspector of the Board, was instructed on the same day to visit the locality and procure specimens, etc., and this was done. On the evening of October 8 a dead rat was sent to the Board for examination, and it was definitely pronounced on October 12 to have had the plague. The Board's inspector proceeded at once to make a systematic local investigation as to the extent of the disease and to tender advice to the sanitary authorities of the districts concerned. He continued his investigations in the districts invaded, and made visits with a view of setting in action steps for the extermination of the rats; and during the entire investigation the Board's inspector has been in communication with the local sanitary authorities in the districts, advising them as to the steps to be taken and receiving weekly reports from their medical officers of health.<lb/>
The Board issued on October 10 an Order, a copy of which I can show to the noble Lord if he desires to see it, imposing upon the sanitary authorities the duty of destroying the rats and preventing their entry into buildings and other premises in the districts. Article 2 of this Order states that if representation is made to the local authority that rats in the district are infected or threatened with plague, or that there is an unusual mortality among the rats in the district, the local authority shall report the matter to the Local Government Board, and shall take steps for the destruction of the rats and for preventing their entry into premises in the district. The noble Lord referred to the question of expenditure. The Order of October 10 provides that the local authority may appoint such additional officers or servants as they may deem necessary and may delegate to them any powers under these regulations, and that the expenses incurred by the local authority in the execution of these regulations shall be defrayed, in the case of a local authority which is a sanitary authority as part of their expenses under the Public Health Act, and in the case of any other local
<col>828</col>
authority as part of their general expenses in the administration of the public health. The local authorities have power, therefore, to incur any additional expenditure that may be necessary for this purpose.<lb/>
Other steps have also been taken by the Board. Arrangements have been made for a special staff of the Lister Institute to go down to Suffolk and make an examination of the rats on a large scale, with a view of ascertaining the kind of rats affected and their special flea parasites. This work is being undertaken by Dr. Martin, the director of the Lister Institute and late Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the India Office on Plague, to whose investigations on plague our present accurate knowledge of the spread of this disease is largely due. The Local Government Board consider that a campaign against rats is a local affair, and there seems no reason why this particular work should be undertaken by the State. I do not think my noble friend will contend that the State is better equipped with machinery for the extermination of rats. At the same time, any advice which the Board can give is at the disposal of the local authorities. The Board of Agriculture have, I am informed, issued a leaflet on the subject. The Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture are in co-operation and in touch with the local authorities, and will continue to give such advice as may be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02223"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The answer of the noble Lord seemed satisfactory until he came to the announcement that the Government considered that this was a matter for the local authorities. A rat does not confine its operations to the district of one local authority. That is the whole danger. I hate centralisation as a rule, but in this case you do want the central authority to see that the regulations are carried out. If that is done I am quite satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02224"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: I can only repeat that the Local Government Board have been in touch with every district in which there has been any reasonable suspicion of the existence of disease-infected rats. They have issued regulations, and given advice, and they are in continual touch with, and receive reports of any suspected outbreak from, all the districts and areas concerned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GREAT BRITAIN AND PERSIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02225"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for India "whether he can say what is the present position as regards Persia obtaining a loan from private sources, and whether it is a fact that in the early part of the year Persia was prevented from obtaining any such financial aid; and to move for Papers."</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02226">The noble Lord said.: My Lords, this Question refers to a matter which I have previously brought to the notice of your Lordships, and I think His Majesty's Government will admit that I have not unduly pressed them for a reply. This is a delicate matter, but I think there is justification for putting this Question at the present moment, because there has recently been presented to the Persian Government an ultimatum with respect to the disorder that exists in Southern Persia. I dare say that it is quite reasonable and proper, in the interest of our trade which is so largely carried on by ourselves and our Indian fellow-subjects in Southern Persia, that we should insist, if possible, on the trade routes being made secure. We are only doing what. Russia has done in the North for many months past; but the point is whether it was ever necessary to present this ultimatum. Persia cannot possibly govern without money, and from time to time, quite apart from the joint loan from Russia and ourselves offered to Persia, I understand that there have been private offers of money made to the Persian Government which at our instance or that of the Russian Government have been forbidden. Hence it is that there is this state of unrest and disorder in Southern Persia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02227">It is alleged that possibly the money, if supplied, would be misappropriated by the Persian Government, but that seems to me a very weak excuse. After all, the sum itself it not so very large, and I do not see how it could have endangered our interests or the interests of Russia if the Persian Government had the administration of this money. In any case, Persia could not go far astray in the administration of this fund with two powerful neighbours on the North and South of her. The result has been that it is perfectly impossible for her to bring order into her widely extended territory and into regions that are so very difficult of access. Our whole conduct has been inconsistent not
<col>830</col>
only with our agreement, but with the assurance of the British Minister at Teheran, when he told the Persian authorities that&#x2014;
<quote>"Persia will be perfectly free to manage her own affairs in her own way."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02228">It is ludicrous to say when you prevent a country from obtaining a loan that you are allowing her to administer her own affairs in her own way. No one rejoices more than I do at our friendship with Russia, but at the same time that friendship must not prejudice our own interests either now or hereafter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02229">In my view we are drifting to a perilous state indeed. I would ask if at the present time you dare not trust the country with a comparatively small sum of money what chance is there that in a certain limited period by policing certain districts of the country you are going to restore stability to Persia? Her prestige has been immeasurably injured by the fact of large Russian forces sitting down in her Northern territory, and you are now going to further reduce her prestige by policing or securing order in her Southern districts. At the same time you prevent her getting the money to put her administration on a sound basis. As far as human foresight can see, is it likely that the Persian Government will be in a better position in the near future than she is to-day? Will it not be rather the reverse? Therefore you are drifting towards what may possibly lead to the partition of Persia, or, on the other hand, to a shilly-shallying policy on our part&#x2014;one moment saying we are going to restore order in the country and. the next moment retiring. Last, and above all, we are offering a serious affront to the Mahomedans of Persia and thereby affronting the Mahomedans of India. I feel that the possibility of the state of affairs in Persia being regenerated and the Government of Persia becoming stable lies in her being allowed to have a sum of money with which properly to equip her administration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02230"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, His Majesty's Government have no desire, nor, if they had the desire, would they be in a position, to prevent the Persian Government obtaining loans from private sources, always provided&#x2014;and. I think everybody will agree that it is a reasonable proviso&#x2014;that any such loan shall in no wise prejudicially affect the securities already set aside for existing loans to
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0420"/>
<col>831</col>
British and Russian banks in Persia. With regard to the latter part of the noble Lord's Question, in March a certain London syndicate made an offer of a loan to the Persian Government, but at that particular time negotiations were proceeding for a joint advance from the British and Russian Governments, and not only was that so, but the interest on British loans was considerably in arrears. Taking those two circumstances into consideration, his Majesty's Government did not see their way to adopt any other course than to warn the Persian Government that while those negotiations were proceeding, and until the arrears of interest had been paid, they were not prepared to agree to the hypothecation by the Persian Government of any sources of its public revenue to any advance except that under negotiation.<lb/>
That was communicated on March 15. Subsequently, when the negotiations for the joint advance broke down, a joint Note was presented on April 7 by the British and Russian Ministers in Teheran to the Persian Government informing them that neither Government would oppose loans from a third party, provided that these conditions were observed:&#x2014;First, that the Customs and other revenues which had been already pledged for British and Russian loans should not be affected by fresh financial obligations; and, secondly, that the British and Russian debts should first be converted. Since then no communication has been made to the Persian Government about loans from private sources; but several firms and individuals or groups have approached the Foreign Office in order to learn the views of His Majesty's Government on the subject, and in each case they have been told the conditions laid down in the Note of April 7, and have been informed that that is the attitude which His Majesty's Government are prepared to maintain.<lb/>
In regard to the present position, His Majesty's Government have taken no steps to oppose any particular loan. In one case they have declined to give their support; and it is quite obvious that they must reserve to themselves the power to give or withhold support in future and to take any steps which may be deemed necessary to safeguard British interests. It is understood that at the present moment negotiations are proceeding between the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Persian Govern-
<col>832</col>
ment with a view to a loan. In any case to attribute the entire state of unrest to the fact that the Persians cannot get money is, perhaps, rather an exaggerated view of the case, for the Persian Government can get money if they are willing to obtain it on reasonable terms. By reasonable terms I mean that no political conditions should attach, and this the Persian Government have been given clearly to understand is a necessary condition. The only condition which would be attached would be a guarantee that such sum as was advanced would be spent in putting the general condition of Persia into better order than, unfortunately, it is at present. The noble Lord asks for Papers. Papers relating to Persian affairs generally are being collected with a view to presentation; but some delay in issuing them is unavoidable. In any case, only such communications as have passed between the two Governments can be published.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02231"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: On the whole the statement of the noble Lord is satisfactory, but I would like to ask whether the conditions mentioned were the same as were laid down earlier in the year, or have the original conditions been modified.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02232"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: The conditions originally laid down no longer hold good, and the Persian Government have been given to understand that that is the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02233"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to say that the answer which has just been given by Lord Herschell will not entirely relieve the minds of many sober-minded people who are anxious about the position in which we stand in Persia. The intrusion of our Government in the sphere of Persian finance is a matter which I view with some anxiety. Of course, no fresh loan should affect the securities already possessed by present creditors, but I cannot refrain from expressing some misgiving in regard to the conditions which the Government have attached to the borrowing of any loan by Persia. No loan is to have any political conditions attached thereto. I do not know what kind of political conditions are in contemplation, or how far it is desirable that we should interfere with loans on the part of the Persian Government, provided they are acting entirely within the proper sphere of action of an independent Government. We really seem to be getting into
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0421"/>
<col>833</col>
the position in which we have been on one or two other occasions, slipping from a position that involves no risk into one of great difficulty and even danger. In my opinion, our interference in this matter is calculated to create embarrassment in our relations, not only with Persia, but with the friendly Power which has acted in co-operation with us in Persia. I would press upon the Foreign Office that Papers in respect to the financial conditions to which the noble Lord referred might be made public without delay, so that we may know exactly how we stand in relation to the financial administration of Persia; and I hope that the production of those Papers will remove the apprehension that we are in danger of drifting into a position in regard to Persia similar to that which led to our intervention in Egypt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02234"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think my noble friend will understand that I do not desire to enter at this moment into a general discussion of the state of Persia and our policy in regard to that country. I merely desire to set him right on one point as to which I think he is under a misapprehension. He seemed to gather from my noble friend Lord Herschell's observations that when it was a question of money being lent to Persia from outside sources some embargo, so to speak, was placed on a loan of that kind on account of political considerations being possibly involved. The objection, so far as objection has been taken, to the loan of money from outside sources to Persia has been of the economic kind described by my noble friend; that is to say, that if the money could not be raised without com-
<col>834</col>
promising the security which is possessed by already existing creditors&#x2014;and my noble friend Lord Courtney entirely agrees that that is a reasonable attitude &#x2014;in that case we should feel bound to object to a further loan. That is how the matter stood.<lb/>
As regards the general question, I may perhaps just say this, particularly as representing the Department which I now do, that we are fully alive to the inconvenience which must always attach to any apparent interference in the internal affairs of a country such as Persia. We are fully alive to all those considerations to which my noble friend has drawn attention from the analogy of our dealings with Egypt, although I think it would not be difficult to show, if this were an opportunity of doing so, that the circumstances in Egypt and in Persia are indeed very different. If it will at all reassure my noble friend, I can assure him we are fully alive to the importance of these considerations both from the point of view of British interests and certainly not less from the point of view of Indian interests.</membercontribution></p>

The three Resolutions are closely connected, and for that reason, and also because some of your Lordships may be glad of an opportunity of offering general observations upon the scheme as a whole, I will say a few words now before I move that the House resolve itself into Committee.</p>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0424"/>
<col>839</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02256">These Resolutions are offered by us as the best substitute which we can provide for the scheme embodied in the Government Bill. They are obviously in the nature of an outline, and, I dare say I shall be told, of a somewhat vague and general outline; but let the House bear in mind that we are precluded, by the distinct intimation made to us from the other side, from dealing with the Parliament Bill by way of Amendment. The noble Earl told us in the simplest language that to attempt such a course would be waste of time. On the other hand, it is quite beyond our power to produce within the limits of the time at our command a full, elaborate, and carefully drawn Bill dealing with the subject. We are therefore thrown back upon Resolutions which must obviously be of a somewhat vague and general character.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>THE FIRST RESOLUTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02257">My Lords, with regard to the first part of the first Resolution, I conceive there will not be much difference of opinion upon either side. We say that it is desirable that provision should be made for settling differences between the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Unless I am mistaken, both sides are committed to that view. But the question arises what we mean when we talk of settling differences. The word "settle" is a rather ambiguous one. When we speak of "settling" differences we have in our minds settlement after full and careful discussion upon terms of some kind of equality. What the noble Earl and his friends have in their minds is apparently not a settlement at all in the strict sense of the word. What is proposed to us in the Bill is that there should be a certain period of delay and that when that period has expired the whole thing is at an end and the House of Lords is not to have another word to say upon the subject. You may settle with your opponent or you may settle your opponent, and I think noble Lords opposite have rather confused the two uses of the word.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02258">We on this side were gratified, when we noticed that in the speech which he delivered the other day the noble Earl showed clearly that he at any rate contemplated something more than a mere bald arrangement under which one House would put its foot down and keep it there. The noble Earl let us see that he at any rate had been thinking about resort to procedure
<col>840</col>
by conference and even to joint sittings, although he left us in no doubt as to the difficulties which he saw in the way of that particular course. Our view certainly is that we ought to look in the first place to some regularised procedure by which in cases of serious difference the two Houses would, as it were, come together and make a joint effort to bring about an adjustment of the difference which lies between them. With regard to the second portion of the first Resolution, your Lordships will notice that we contemplate a settlement between the House of Commons and the House of Lords reconstituted and reduced in numbers in accordance with the recent Resolutions of this House. We dwell upon that because we wish it to be clearly understood that in our view no full and complete settlement is possible except upon the basis of a reformed and reconstituted House of Lords. We at any rate can be no party to a policy based upon an indefinite postponement of the consideration of that question, leaving the country in the meantime with nothing but an unreformed and impotent Second Chamber.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>THE SECOND RESOLUTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02259">I pass to the second Resolution, which deals with general Bills, or in other words with all business except business of a financial character, about which I shall say a word presently. We ask your Lordships to put side by side and to contrast the plan which is suggested in the Government Bill and the plan embodied in this Resolution. Under the Government Bill the House of Lords is to be permitted to reject a Bill three times within a space of two years. After that there is no more to be said, and if the House of Lords persists in its objection the House of Lords is overruled without further parley. We, on the contrary, propose that the House of Lords should be content with two rejections, and with an interval of one year. But we propose that if during that interval the matter has not been settled, resort should be had to procedure by a joint sitting of the two Houses, and in a certain class of cases to procedure by way of Referendum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02260">We say nothing in this Resolution about conferences between the two Houses, but that is not because we attach no importance to procedure by conference. On the contrary in our view it is essential that not only when the difference has reached an acute stage but at any stage in the progress
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0425"/>
<col>841</col>
of a measure there should be opportunity for conference between the two Houses of Parliament. And by conference I mean what is described in the text-books as a. free conference devoid of all those formalities by which conferences were at one time characterised and as little rigid as possible in its procedure. We do occasionally resort to conferences under our present system. But I think the noble Earl, and other members of the House who have taken part in such conferences will agree with me when I say that at present they are usually held under circumstances which offer as little prospect as possible of bringing about a satisfactory result. They are usually held at the very end of a session, when opinions have crystallised and when owing to the shortness of the time available it becomes almost impossible really to discuss, in the manner in which such discussion is desirable, the matters at issue. The question which presents itself to those who take part in these conferences is too often not so much how can we convert the measure before us into a perfect piece of legislation. One side asks itself rather whether it is worth while to make such and such a sacrifice in order to save the Bill and the other side asks itself whether it really can afford to lose the Bill, and so the parties either agree, or agree to differ. That has very often happened within my knowledge. We must, then, take it for granted that conferences will be resorted to, but I hope under more propitious circumstances than the conferences with which we are usually familiar.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02261">Then if the conference leads to nothing we come to the joint sitting. The idea of a joint sitting of the two Houses seems to me, I must say, eminently natural and reasonable. If two great bodies cannot agree, what can be more reasonable and more natural than that they or some of their members should meet and debate together that which they have been unable to settle when they were debating by themselves? The noble Earl knows that this procedure is resorted to and forms part of the Constitution of some of our great self-governing Colonies, notably of the South African Constitution granted by the noble Earl and his colleagues not long ago. The noble Earl told us the other evening that there are great difficulties in the way of making use of this procedure by Conference; and I am quite ready to admit that those difficulties are real. One difficulty that occurs to us at once is the difficulty arising out of the number
<col>842</col>
of the two legislative bodies concerned. In our case you hive a numerous House of Commons and a numerous House of Lords, and a joint sitting of these two bodies in their full strength would obviously lead to a somewhat unwieldly and perhaps unbusinesslike gathering. But we have drafted our Resolution in such a way as to make it plain that upon that question our mind is open. It is evident that there may be a joint sitting of the <i>plenum</i> of the two Houses, or again there may be a joint sitting in which part will be taken by a delegation from either House, or you may conceive a case in which one House would be represented by the whole of its members and the other House only by a delegation of its members. We regard that as eminently a point for examination, and we merely say that the joint sitting should be composed of members of the two Houses. But if I want to justify the latitude which is left in this Resolution I think I can do so by pointing out to your Lordships that this particular question of the manner in which the joint sitting is to be composed cannot possibly be settled in so far as it affects this House of Parliament until we know how this House of Parliament is to be composed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02262">Before I leave the Resolution dealing with ordinary legislation I desire to point out the provision which is made in the second part of the Resolution for dealing with matters which are of great gravity, and which have not been adequately submitted to the judgment of the people. In our view some special procedure is essential in the ease of matters which can be so described. I shall no doubt be asked by the noble Earl&#x2014;and the question is a very reasonable one&#x2014;how we define matters which are grave and have not been adequately discussed. I say at once that I do not believe it is possible either in a Resolution or in an Act of Parliament, so to speak, to rail off by strict defiinition questions which can be described as grave questions from questions which stop short of being grave. But nevertheless I believe there will be a general concurrence in your Lordships' House that there are questions obviously of such a character&#x2014;capital questions, if I may so describe them&#x2014;which deserve special treatment, and with regard to which greater safeguards are necessary than the safeguards which will suffice for ordinary routine legislation of the year. That observation applies with special force to legislation dealing
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0426"/>
<col>843</col>
with the Constitution of the country. By Constitutional questions I mean, speaking in general terms, proposals for altering, not the laws of this country, but the Parliamentary machinery by which those laws are made. It seems to me that there is a difference in kind between measures which come within that category and measures which do not. Questions of that sort&#x2014;Constitutional questions&#x2014;are, so far as I am aware, specially safeguarded in the Constitutions of almost every foreign country of which we are aware. The precautions taken in some of these countries to safeguard Constitutional change are so strict as to render such change not only difficult but in some cases almost impossible. But there are questions which do not fall within the category of Constitutional questions and with regard to which we believe that it is essential that an appeal should be made to the people of the country before a new departure is made. I cite as an illustration of my meaning such questions as compulsory service or the disestablishment of the Church. It seems to me impossible to contend that matters of that kind should be dealt with except under the protection of safeguards greater than those which are provided in the case of ordinary legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02263">Then what do we mean when we talk of a measure not having been adequately submitted to the judgment of the people? What we have in our minds is the case of a Bill dealing with one of these capital questions, sprung on the country at a moment of excitement and when perhaps half-a-dozen policies are being laid at the same time before the constituencies, a Bill perhaps supported by a majority which cannot be considered as really decisive. How then, I shall be asked, do we propose to determine whether a given matter is a grave matter and has not been adequately submitted to the country? It seems to me obvious that there are more ways than one in which that question could be determined. For example, a Resolution of either House of Parliament might be sufficient to transfer a question from the joint sitting to the constituencies. In that case I presume the Government that proposed the measure would have to consider whether they would persevere with it, or whether they would submit it to the verdict of the electors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02264">But another course suggests itself also. You might without much difficulty set up a Parliamentary tribunal which would be
<col>844</col>
competent to decide in each case whether the measure in question was or was not a measure calling for special treatment. I venture to say, speaking for myself, that if this procedure by Referendum were to be introduced I should hope to see it resorted to not only for the sake of settling differences between the two Houses, but also for the purpose of affording if need be a check upon legislation even when both Houses are agreed. That is a very important point; and let me say in passing that the Referendum is used in more foreign countries than one, not only for the purpose of settling differences, but of putting a check upon structural or organic legislation. It appears to me, therefore, that an arrangement of that kind would afford one mode of meeting the complaint which is so constantly made on the other side of the House that when a Conservative Government is in power and the two Houses are consequently agreed so far as Party principles are concerned, you have virtually single-Chamber government, and that at such a time and under such conditions any measure which the Conservative Government support can be carried through Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02265">I will not detain the House with a disquisition on the merits of the Referendum, but I venture to say this of it&#x2014;that it seems to me to afford the only means of correcting what always appears to me to be the weakest point in our Parliamentary system. How does that system work? We are constantly told that a member of the House of Commons has a mandate from the constituency that returns him. How does he obtain it? He is chosen by a body of electors who may be extremely ill-informed with regard to many of the questions before the public at the time. He is chosen amid the turmoil and excitement of a General Election, when perhaps a good many different questions are simultaneously agitating the country, and he may be chosen by a very small majority of his constituents. Upon the strength of that choice he is regarded as having a mandate to represent, or perhaps to misrepresent, his constituents for a term of years. Is it possible for the gentlemen who is elected always to feel sure that lie interprets the wishes of his constituents correctly? Is it, again, possible for the electors to feel sure that the gentleman whom they have returned to Parliament will correctly interpret their views? It cannot be possible either for the electors
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0427"/>
<col>845</col>
or for the elected to have foreseen the whole of the political developments and complications which may take place within the space of five or six years. In such circumstances a vote of the House of Commons may be no real reflection of the views and wishes of the people of the country, and for that reason it seems to me eminently desirable that in the case which I am supposing there should be an opportunity of obtaining an expression of the views of the country without putting it to all the trouble and expense of a General Election. I have seen it constantly stated that a Referendum is objectionable on account of its great cost. My impression is that the estimates of the cost of the Referendum are very much exaggerated; but I humbly express my own conviction that if we had this power of resorting to the Referendum, the Referendum would not be very often resorted to. My strong impression is that the knowledge that the Referendum is there in the background would, in five cases out of six, lead to what I might describe as a settlement out of Court, and that the Referendum would be resorted to only in a case where there was reason to suppose confidently that an appeal to the people would be a successful appeal.</p>

<section>
<title>THE THIRD RESOLUTION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02266">My Lords, I pass now to the Resolution dealing with Money Bills. It commences with an intimation that&#x2014;
<quote>"the Lords are prepared to forego their Constitutional right to reject or amend Money Bills-which are purely financial in character."</quote>
That is a renunciation which I have no doubt seems to a good many of your Lordships to go further than we have a right to ask you to go. Our Constitutional right to reject; Money Bills is, in my belief, unassailable; but I should like to ask your Lordships whether you are in the habit of exercising it, whether you are likely to exercise it, in the case of Money Bills which are really, to use the words of the Resolution, purely financial in their character. I can call to mind no case in which a desire has been expressed on this side of the House to reject a Money Bill purely of a financial character, and my impression is that when your Lordships have desired to interfere with Money Bills it has been for the express reason that those Money Bills were, in your opinion, not of a purely financial character, but embodied provisions
<col>846</col>
directed to purposes other than financial purposes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02267">The Resolution contains two provisos&#x2014;the proviso that effectual provision is to be made against "tacking," and the proviso that if any question arises as to whether a Money Bill is of a purely financial character it shall be referred to a Joint Committee of the two Houses. As to "tacking" I do not suppose that there is very much difference of opinion between the two sides of the House. Your Lordships will have it in your minds that what we mean by "tacking" is, to use the language of the often-quoted Resolution of 1702, the addition to a Bill of aid and Supply of something "foreign to and different from the matter of the Bill." By that, of course, is meant an attempt to force some incongruous measure through the House of Lords by the expedient of grafting it on to a Money Bill. That practice I do not think is defended on either side of the House, and we assume that the safeguards which to some extent now exist against that practice will be continued and will be made effectual. But we go on to propose that when, apart from "tasking" in the stricter sense, a question arises as to the character of a disputed Bill the question should be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses. We have added this separate proviso because, as I said a moment ago, it seems to us that it is not enough that there should be precautions against "tacking" in the strict and narrow sense of the word, but that there should be an opportunity given to this House of dealing with Bills in which "tacking" in the stricter sense does not take place, but which, although, no doubt, Financial Bills and dealing with finance, are Bills calculated to produce political and social effects, the importance of which is far in excess of the mere financial operation of the measure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02268">Here, again, we encounter the same difficulty of arriving at a definition of that which is and that which is not a Money Bill of a purely financial character, and it is quite clear that this difficulty of definition is a very real one. We arc ready to concede that Bills of aid and Supply in the narrower sense of the word belong to the House of Commons, but we object entirely to the extreme claim that any Bill beginning with the usual financial Resolution in Committee of the House of Commons or containing provisions involving expenditure out of the rates or taxes
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0428"/>
<col>847</col>
is to be treated as a Money Bill. I think it is clear that between these two extremes there must lie in the region of finance a certain amount of debatable ground on which each House of Parliament properly conceives that it has a right to intervene. In our view the only way of arriving at a decision with regard to these extremely difficult and controversial points is that there should be a tribunal created for the purpose of adjudicating upon them. In our view that tribunal ought not to be a Court of Law, because we conceive that the questions which would come before it would be concerned not so much with the strict interpretation of carefully drawn provisions of an Act of Parliament as with a broad and common-sense view of that which is just and reasonable as between the two Houses of Parliament. We propose that such a Committee should be set up and we propose that it should be presided over by the Speaker of the House of Commons. For reasons which I gave two or three days ago, we object very much to the idea of making the Speaker of the House of Commons the sole arbiter in such cases as this, but we admit that if there is to be a Standing Committee of this kind it could not have a more dignified president, or a president with greater Parliamentary authority behind him, than that high official.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02269">My Lords, the only other point that arises in this Resolution arises in connection with the last paragraph of it which provides that should the Committee come to a conclusion that the Money Bill before them is not of a purely financial character and should not therefore be dealt with as Money Bills are dealt with, the Bill should go forthwith to the joint sitting for disposal. We inserted that provision because in our view it would be unreasonable to claim that what I might call a mixed Bill involving money and other things besides should be dealt with by the Referendum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02270">I have now given you in broad outline, and 1 am afraid very imperfectly, an account of these Resolutions. I quite admit that our real difficulties will begin when we come, if we ever do, to fill in the outlines. I admit that frankly, but that does not seem to me to be a reason why an attempt should not be made to fill in the outlines. What I venture to submit to the House is this, that, until Parliament has tried to find a
<col>848</col>
settlement on these lines, we have no right to throw up our hands in despair and to say that this House of Parliament, or, indeed, either House of Parliament, is to be denied legitimate opportunities of discussing one of the most momentous questions which has been raised within our recollection. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02271">Moved, That this House do resolve itself into Committee in order to consider the following resolutions upon the relations between the two Houses of Parliament:</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02283"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR. INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess has made some preliminary observations upon his Resolutions with his accustomed clearness, with moderation, and, indeed, with a certain degree of admission, not merely of the difficulty of the subject, but in some degree of the case of those who are opposed to him. Before I say a word on the general subject, I should like to say something upon the rather arbitrary and complicated proceedings which have led up to the introduction of these Resolutions. We understood from the noble Marquess that the object of your Lordships was to secure a discussion of the whole question before t he Dissolution took place, and I venture to think that in bringing forward these Resolutions in the way in which he has, the noble Marquess has not gone the best way to achieve that object. Two other courses were open to him, either of which I think would have been preferable to the one which has been adopted, and both of which, if I may say so&#x2014;of course using the word only in a Parliamentary sense&#x2014;would have shown a little more candour and would have been more in conformity with the Parliamentary practice of your Lordships' House. It was open to your Lordships to read the Bill a second time, and, having done so, to move in Committee a limited number of Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02284"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: We should never have got into Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02285"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I will deal with the noble Marquess's point in a moment. It was open to your Lordships to read the Bill a second time, and, having done so, to move in Committee a limited number of Amendments comprising precisely the same points as those raised in these Resolutions. The noble Marquess who interrupted me a moment ago says the Bill could never have got into Committee. There was no reason why a general discussion of the Bill should not have taken place on Monday and Tuesday, and it would have been quite as easy to go into Committee afterwards for that
<col>850</col>
limited purpose as it is to deal with these Resolutions. It is quite true that, when you know a Bill is going to be proceeded with with a view to becoming law, an interval of time may reasonably be asked for to move Amendments of all kinds. But it is only the particular subjects touched on in these Resolutions which your Lordships desire to bring before the House; and you would, I think, have achieved precisely the object which you are achieving now, and would have done so in a more regular way, if, for the purpose of that discussion which we are told is so vital, you had taken the whole of Monday and Tuesday. The other alternative would have been to throw out the Bill. We should then have had Monday's and Tuesday's discussion, and your Lordships might have thrown it out with all ceremony last night. You might then have proceeded exactly as you are doing now, and the noble Marquess could have gone on with his alternative policy. From one point of view it does not greatly matter to us. Our Bill, we understood from the first, is to be killed. It does not matter to us whether its throat is cut or it is smothered in cotton wool.<lb/>
But when we arc told, as we have been, that we have stifled discussion and prevented the matter being brought before your Lordships' House, I am bound to point out that you Lave lost the whole of one Parliamentary day and a portion of another which you might have given to the discussion of the entire subject. We are told&#x2014;and the statement is cheered by noble Lords opposite&#x2014;that we have attempted to evade and avoid the discussion of this subject. The form which discussions take in this House is only nominally in the hands of the Government; it is really in the hands of noble Lords opposite. They have only to raise a question and ask for an opportunity for its discussion and discussion takes place whether we desire it or not. The noble Marquess only had to invite us to introduce the Bill and we at once agreed to do so. It seems to me that this question is going to receive quite an unusual amount of discussion. I certainly do not complain of that, because it is a question of enormous magnitude. It is being discussed here&#x2014;I quite admit only in outline&#x2014;this week; it is going to be discussed for weeks before the country on a thousand platforms, and a vast number of statements of varying accuracy will doubtless be made about
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0430"/>
<col>851</col>
I am not prepared to say that the statements made on either side will be entirely accurate; if they are they will be very unlike statements which are usually made at General Elections. But assume, if your Lordships will honour us by doing so for a moment, that after the General Election things remain as they are. The Bill that we shall bring in will have to go through the whole period of a long Parliamentary discussion in both Houses, Amendments will be moved, and it will receive that measure of discussion which everybody knows an important Constitutional Bill, whether it be a Home Rule Bill or any Bill of the kind, always receives. On the other hand, if noble Lords opposite are fortunate enough to cross the House and to find themselves in charge they will bring in a Bill founded on the noble Marquess's Resolutions. That. I have no doubt, will pass practically in the form in which they bring it in. We may discuss it, but I have no doubt we shall not be permitted in any way to amend it; but there, again, the subject will receive a full measure of discussion, and I confess I am at a loss to understand what is meant when it is said that discussion is stifled. The tone adopted by the noble Marquess and also, I think, by my noble friend on the Cross Bench, suggests that the Bill is being forced into law now by means of the guillotine. That is not the case. The subject is going to be discussed for weeks before the country, and it will occupy heaven only knows how much of the next session of Parliament whichever Party is returned to power.<lb/>
The noble Marquess in his Resolutions brings forward his alternative proposals, and I quite admit that they are proposals which ought to be most fully examined and discussed. They come, no doubt, as a startling novelty to a great many people both in your Lordships' House and outside it. All the propositions which are laid down by the noble Marquess are, of course, familiar to those who have made a particular study of this subject, who have studied the comparative history of the subject in different countries and are familiar with the various devices by which the Parliamentary machine is framed under different systems. But I suspect that, coming from the noble Marquess, they must be regarded as new&#x2014;by some people even as alarmingly new when they have regarded the established order of things
<col>852</col>
as likely to last for ever, and when they perceive the sweeping changes, at any rate on paper, which the noble Marquess proposes to introduce.<lb/>
I do not wish to take up much time in discussing the details of these Resolutions because I have made far too many speeches during the last few days, and I would very much rather that other noble Lords took up the tale on this occasion. But I would like, if I may be allowed, to make one or two general observations on the proposals of the noble Marquess. I said something two days ago upon the proposition of a joint sitting, and I repeat what I then said, that the idea has many attractions. It is familiar in some of our Constitutions in the Dominions overseas, and undoubtedly it has a common-sense air about it. But bearing in mind the proposed constitution of your Lordships' House&#x2014;a number of 300 or 400&#x2014;if that number is to be added to the number of members of the House of Commons I may remind your Lordships that it may probably be necessary to hire a hall of the nature of Olympia for the purpose of discussion, and a close discussion of the details of a Bill in such circumstances will not be a very simple matter. And when the noble Marquess opposite meets that difficulty by saying that delegations of both Houses might meet together for the purpose, I would remind the House that it is not an easy thing to suggest any means by which a delegation of the House of Commons could sit for such a purpose &#x2014;that is to say, for the purpose of arriving at a final solution of a question&#x2014;because the members of the House of Commons are equal, and there is no particular reason why a Member representing one constituency should be allowed to have a final voice in the solution of a question rather than the Member for another constituency; and although I can conceive the possibility of a delegation being appointed from your Lordships' House as it now exists, I foresee great difficulty in doing so if the House is elaborately reconstituted on the lines I have seen suggested.<lb/>
The Referendum seems to have become a new, but in a very short space of time a favourite child of noble Lords opposite. I ventured the other day to caution your Lordships against rushing too boldly into advocacy of the Referendum. It has an attractive sound; it sounds thoroughly
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0431"/>
<col>853</col>
democratic. An appeal to the will of the people by vote is obviously in itself a democratic thing; but. I venture to think that the difficulties in regard to the Referendum do not diminish when one begins to examine how exactly it is to be brought into operation in a country like this and in a manner for which there is no precedent whatever in any foreign country. Nobody has ever attempted to use the Referendum as a means of settling difficulties between two Houses of Parliament, at any rate on the gigantic scale on which it is proposed to be used here. As a rule it has been used for entirely different purposes. In Switzerland it is only used for one purpose to which the noble Marquess stated that it might be applied here. In a case in which the two Houses of Parliament have passed a measure, it is open to a certain number of citizens&#x2014;I think the number is 30,000 &#x2014;to demand a Referendum, so to speak, against Parliament. There it is not used for the purpose of composing differences between the two Houses. Speaking generally, where it has been used in other countries, it has been used quite independently of differences between Houses of. Parliament and to ascertain whether the people want a particular subject dealt with by Parliament. That, I confess, seems to me the most reasonable and practical way of using it&#x2014;that is to say, at the time of an election the country is asked to declare separately whether it wants to express an opinion on a special subject&#x2014;it might be religious education or woman suffrage, or some question of that kind. But there, again, it is not used for solving a political crisis, and it seems to me that you will have great difficulty in using it on the enormous scale on which it would have to be used for this purpose.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said that, in his judgment, the cost of a Referendum had been greatly overstated. It is quite true in a sense that if you take the Referendum say by Post Office, without any of the apparatus that accompanies a Parliamentary General Election, the cost would not be anything approaching the figures which have often been stated. But you are in this dilemma. When taking your Referendum it you take no trouble to bring the question before the people but merely send the papers round, you will get very few answers, and the results may be almost ludicrously unsatisfactory if it is a question of deciding the fate of an
<col>854</col>
important measure. But, on the other hand, if you are going to take all the steps to bring the question before the people&#x2014;by meetings, placards, and the usual paraphernalia of a General Election&#x2014;you will find yourselves running into something nearly approaching the cost of a General Election. That is the dilemma. to which noble Lords opposite may be able to supply an answer, but I confess I know of none.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, what is going to the Referendum? Matters of great gravity; and the noble Marquess has indicated that in his view "matters of great gravity" include Constitutional questions in the main, although they may also include some others. This question of gravity, I confess, seems to me to be an exceedingly difficult one. About the gravest question which I think the country could be called upon to decide, or at: my rate one of the gravest questions&#x2014;noble Lords opposite, I am sure, will admit it&#x2014;is that of a tariff. It is obviously of the most far-reaching character. A tariff, if you compose it wrongly, may inflict more discomfort and loss upon a. larger number of individuals in this country than could be inflicted by any other measure which it is possible to conceive. Therefore, one would think that a. tariff was one of the subjects which a Party should not be allowed to settle entirely of its own will. without an appeal to the country and knowing what the country wants. But you cannot, I take it, put a tariff into a Referendum; at least, I cannot conceive by what machinery it could be clone. Yet, on the showing of the noble Marquess opposite, a Tariff Reform measure is one which, above all others, ought to go to the country before it is decided by Parliament.<lb/>
What the noble Marquess said was that Bills which were in appearance Money Bills, but which carried. with them important political and social effects, were just those which ought not to be treated as purely Money Bills and upon which the country ought to be called upon to decide. I understand that among the many and various definitions of Tariff Reform which I have heard during recent years the one thing which is put forward is that it is not so much a project for raising revenue as for producing important political and social effects. The political effects are to be produced by Colonial preference, and
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0432"/>
<col>855</col>
the social effects are to be produced by curing unemployment. But this measure is to be run through Parliament by an energetic Lower House and an acquiescent Upper House without the country having a word to say in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02286"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: What about the General Election before?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02287"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether at the General Election the details of the tariff are likely to be mentioned. I should think it exceedingly doubtful. The noble Lord I have no doubt carries them in his head, but I do not think he will be allowed to produce then on a platform during, the coming election. I shall look out for his speeches, as I always do, with interest, but I do not expect to find in them the details of a tariff.<lb/>
One word more on that point. It may be said that a tariff, after all, is a thing which may be passed by one Parliament but the next Parliament may reverse it. That is not so. That is one of the things which makes us especially anxious not to place you in a position to be able to pass this tariff, because when you have once passed it, it will be exceedingly difficult to get rid of it. You will enter into engagements with foreign countries and with our oversea Dominions&#x2014;almost obligations of honour which cannot be broken&#x2014;and yet the country is not to have a word to say as to the manner in which you choose to do this. What it seems to me to come to is that Liberal measures are to be subject to the Referendum: Conservative measures are not. It is hardly to be supposed, whatever may be our abstract opinions of the virtue of the Referendum, that we can agree cheerfully to assent to sonic of the main objects of our political programme, if that is the word, being subjected to this peculiar disability, whilst yours are to go free. A tariff, for instance, is not to go to a Referendum, but a measure like the abolition of plural voting has to go. The abolition of plural voting may be right or wrong, but it conies under the head of Constitutional questions, and therefore falls under the ban of the noble Marquess. But nobody can say that it approaches the magnitude of Tariff Reform or of half a dozen other things.<lb/>
The real difficulty of the Referendum, as I suspect your Lordships will find when
<col>856</col>
you advocate it through the country, is that many people will regard it, if it is to be treated as a subject of frequent or general resort, as something like the negation of our system of representative government. I do not deny that there may be cases in which a. Referendum would be a way in which the opinion of the country might be properly ascertained. There are just a few questions&#x2014;they are only very few&#x2014; which can be replied to by "Yes" or "No," and unless you can put them into that form or nearly into that form the Referendum loses much of its value. But if it is to be understood that the Liberal Party is to be perpetually subjected to this uncertain method of appeal, you will find yourselves with a diminishing responsibility on the part of Members of Parliament in a. way which, I think, would be most unfortunate. It would be a grievous thing if members of the House of Commons were to feel that it did not matter very much what they did or in what form they legislated because the whole thing had got to go to the country in the form of Referendum. Therefore I beg your Lordships to pause before you dash into this as a regular policy in the manner which seems likely from the Resolutions of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
On the question of finance I have very little to say. The noble Marquess has pointed out that, although the express foregoing of the right of rejecting Money Bills appeared to constitute some abrogation of the privileges of your Lordships' House, yet, as a matter of fact, joined with the other provisions of his Resolutions which strictly limit the Money Bills to Bills dealing with money and nothing else, his proposals do not go very far. And yet I observe that they have caused some alarm. I notice that this supposed touch of weakness on the part of the noble Marquess received a severe reproof in the columns of <i>The Times</i> this morning. It was hinted that the right of rejecting Budgets was, in the opinion of many noble Lords, not one lightly to be parted with. The noble Marquess spoke of habit. I quite agree that if the rejection of Budgets became to your Lordships a habit in the sense in which people speak of the morphia or cocaine habit, it would be a misfortune from every point of view. Therefore I am disposed to agree that, so far as the right of rejection is concerned, your Lordships will probably think that you are not giving up a great deal. But on the Constitutional
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0433"/>
<col>857</col>
right of amending Money Bills as explicity alluded to in the noble Marquess's Resolutions, I think I ought to point out that that is a right which, if it exists at all, has not been exercised for a very great number of years, and I think that the noble Viscount opposite, Lord St. Aldwyn, will confirm me when I say that it is a right which has never been at any time admitted by the House of Commons as existing.</membercontribution></p>

I think I have covered roughly the grounds covered by the noble Marquess's Resolutions. I hope the discussion which follows will be of a general character and that it will not be confined to an expression of the views of those who sit on the two Front Benches, but that we shall learn in the course of the debate what is the opinion of representative members of the House at large. It seems to me that the object which noble Lords opposite desire to serve by this preliminary discussion&#x2014;namely, to bring the subject before the country&#x2014;will be better served in this way than if we confined ourselves to the making of formal speeches by those members of your Lordships' House whose opinions are tolerably well known.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02290"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just sat down is always so fair and courteous in his speeches in this House, even under difficulties, that I confess I was surprised at some of the remarks at the commencement. of his speech. The noble Earl charged my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition with a want of candour. I am sure my noble friend has not been guilty of want of candour in his observations on the Parliament Bill. Then the noble Earl went on to say that my noble friend had also been guilty of an arbitrary proceeding. Undoubtedly there has been an arbitrary proceeding in the course of this week, but it has been on the part of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
For what have they done? They introduced the Parliament Bill into this House on Monday, telling us they would not accept any Amendment, and that not merely the debate on the Second Reading, but
<col>858</col>
also the full consideration of the Bill in Committee, must be finished in a week. I say that looking to the great importance of the question at issue, it would have been absolutely impossible for this House properly to have discussed the measure and to have formulated and introduced Amendments to it in the time allowed before the 'Dissolution. The noble Earl has told us that my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition has proposed new and sweeping changes on paper. I will deal later with the suggestion that they are only on paper. But I wonder whether the proposals in the Resolutions are not familiar to the noble Earl? Far be it from me to inquire into the proceedings of the Conference. I know nothing about them, but I suspect that those proposals must have been under discussion at the Conference, and therefore that the noble Earl had ample time to consider them.<lb/>
I am anxious&#x2014;if I may be allowed&#x2014;to go somewhat beyond the proposals actually before your Lordships. It is impossible, in discussing them, not to allude to the Resolutions carried by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery)&#x2014; which form part of our proposals for dealing with the question&#x2014;and, moreover, I think it is only fair, if we can do so within the limits of order, that we should be allowed some opportunity of comparing the two alternative policies which are proposed by the two sides of the House. It has been suggested more than once, and notably by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, that the proposals from this side of the House are too late. Well, I confess that they are late in the day. Speaking for myself, I heartily wish they had been made a year or even two years ago. But the noble and learned Lord was amply answered by the noble. Earl, Lord Rosebery, the other day. The noble and learned Lord. asked my noble friend why he, as Chairman of the Committee of your Lordships' House which considered this matter, did not make proposals upon it to the House of Lords in the year 1909; and the noble Earl replied that as he did not consider the recommendations of the Committee adequate for dealing with the question he was unable to make any such proposals to the House. That, I confess, was the position of myself and other noble Lords who took an active and prominent part in the proceedings of that Committee; and I have always thought
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0434"/>
<col>859</col>
that the inadequacy of the 'recommendations of the Committee was largely due to the deliberate refusal of His Majesty's Government to take any part in its proceedings.<lb/>
But we are also told that the proposals now made by my noble friend are a sham. That was not said by the noble Earl opposite. He is far too courteous to make any such suggestion. But it has been said by his colleagues, and by colleagues of high position. I have no authority to speak for any one but myself; but I will say this, that in considering whether these proposals are really meant to solve the great question between the two Houses of Parliament, and the difficulties of which noble Lords opposite complain, I think authority ought to be attached to what was said by Mr. Balfour, the Leader of the Unionist Party, at Nottingham. Mr. Balfour said, in the first place, that it was not wholesome that there should be two Chambers so diversified in political complexion as our two Chambers were in 1906. He went on to say that there should be a Second Chamber; that it must be a real Second Chamber; that the Second Chamber should be greatly diminished in number; that it should be composed of Peers elected by their brother Peers, of qualified Peers, and that others, not Peers, at least equal to half the Chamber should be brought in from the outside, representative of great bodies of external opinion, owing their position to other causes more in harmony with modern theories of government than hereditary right. That, I contend, is an undertaking to endeavour to carry a thorough reform of the House of Lords.<lb/>
When we are told that we do not intend any such reform, that we wish the House to remain as it is now, a sort of fortress of one political Party, I venture to say, in view of these declarations of Mr. Balfour, that the charges are absolutely unfounded. Mr. Balfour went on to say that the House of Commons must he dominant in the relations between the two Houses, that deadlocks must be remedied, and he added &#x2014;and this is a matter of vital importance &#x2014;that if the two Houses dissented on a matter of sufficient importance the arbiter must be the people. That is the position. In the circumstances it is not fair to charge my noble friend who has proposed these Resolutions, or the Party on this side as
<col>860</col>
a whole, with an endeavour to meet this great Constitutional question with a sham set of proposals never intended to make any real change in the political complexion or power of the House of Lords.<lb/>
We have admitted that the matter requires to be dealt with, that there is a grievance in the present position of a Liberal Government owing to the difficulty which they have in passing measures through this House which, in their opinion, are necessary for the good of the country, and which may be rejected by this House, or modified in a way of which they do not approve. We have not only admitted the difficulty, but we desire to remove it by the Resolutions we have already passed, and by those now before the House, consistently with the freedom of the people to control the proceedings not only of this House, but of the House of Commons as well. Take the proposals already carried for the future composition of your Lordships' House. Mr. Balfour said plainly that the element from outside, whether elected directly or indirectly, or nominated by the Government, or appointed in some other way, must be at least half of the members of your Lordships' House. He also said that this House must be greatly diminished in number. It is not fair to say after that that it is intended to put this House on an absolute equality with the House of Commons in any Conference or joint sitting of the two Houses.<lb/>
We have not attempted to define the proportionate numbers. It is impossible to settle the proportion between the two Houses in a Joint Sitting until we know how this House is to be composed, and of how many members it is to consist. I gather from the speech of the noble Earl opposite the other night that he is enamoured of his own proportion of one-quarter for the Upper Chamber which he enacted in the South Africa Act. It may be that noble Lords on this side would desire a larger proportion. That, as I have said, is a matter to be decided when the composition of this Chamber is settled. But it is clear that in the joint sitting contemplated by these Resolutions the House of Commons would be predominant. The noble. Earl opposite said that the two Chambers together, under any conceivable arrangement, would be too many in number for a joint sitting, and he rather threw cold water on the proposal of delegation. But
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0435"/>
<col>861</col>
why should there not be a delegation from each Chamber&#x2014;a large Committee&#x2014;for the purpose of joint discussion, and why should not every member of both Chambers, at the end of the discussion, vote as he thought proper? It would be perfectly possible to make an arrangement of that kind.<lb/>
The noble Earl went on to criticise the Referendum. I agree with him, as every one must who has considered the matter, that there are great difficulties in any form of Referendum. But other countries have faced these difficulties and overcome them, and why should not we? One thing I think is essential. If the Referendum is adopted, it must be fair to both political Parties. You cannot adopt the Referendum in regard to measures which are dear to the hearts of noble Lords opposite and refuse it in the case of measures to which they object when the Unionist Party are in office. The noble Earl said that a Referendum would not meet a political crisis. I agree. The object of a Referendum is to avoid a political crisis and to obtain assent to or rejection by the country of one particular measure without incurring a political crisis. The noble Earl said that you would not get, except at great expense, an adequate vote on a Referendum. Why not? I thought there was such a burning desire in this country for the legislation proposed by noble Lords opposite. Do they tell us that the people at large will not take the trouble to vote in favour of it, or if it is as objectionable as some think that those who do not like it will not vote against it? I believe a Referendum could be worked quite easily subject to the enactment of some body like a Joint Committee of both Houses, with the Speaker as Chairman, to prepare the proper question to be put to the people after a sufficient minority of the members of both Houses had claimed a Referendum on any particular measure. The noble Earl touched on the question of Tariff Reform, on which I am in some degree in sympathy with him. No doubt you cannot refer the details of a tariff to time people, but what would be easier than to put to the people the simple question&#x2014;Will you have Colonial Preference.? Will you have import duties on manufactured goods? Those two questions could be easily settled by any tribunal, and a vote Aye or Nay upon them would practically decide Tariff Reform.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02292"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl entirely failed to see that my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition had provided for this very case in what he said with regard to his intentions as to Money Bills My noble friend said that Bills dealing with finance and producing political or social effects far in excess of the measure itself should not be considered purely Money Bills. That is a proposal which would enable the policy of Tariff Reform to be put to the people in the simplest way that could be devised.<lb/>
The noble Earl went on to the Resolutions dealing with finance. I do not think he was quite satisfied with them, but I do not see why they should not be as agreeable to His Majesty's Government as the proposals in the Parliament Bill. They certainly do remove the control of pure finance from this House. I think they ought to do so. It was because I held this opinion that I was unfortunately unable to agree with my noble friend near me when last winter he moved the rejection of the Finance Bill. But; nobody contends that this House should be allowed to amend Money Bills properly so called. The noble Earl seemed to criticise the insertion of the word "amend" in my noble friend's third Resolution, but he would not, of course, wish this House to amend Money Bills, and therefore it is just as well to say that this House should not do so, As for the. rejection, I think that, safeguarded as it is by words which really are more favourable to the desires of noble Lords opposite than they ever supposed, I think the proposal of my noble friend with regard to Money Bills is a very fair settlement of the question of finance between the two Houses. I do not know that I need trouble your Lordships with any further discussion of these Resolutions, but I venture to say that, having regard to their actual proposals, I cannot imagine why it is impossible for His Majesty's Government to take them into fair consideration instead of putting the country to the trouble and expense of a Dissolution.<lb/>
What fairer basis for a settlement could be suggested than the basis afforded by these Resolutions? The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said the other day, "What you suggest is impossible; we cannot deal with the matter in this way&#x2014;it
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0436"/>
<col>863</col>
would take at least twelve months." Twelve months would never have been better spent by the two Houses of Parliament, for no one ever spoke a truer word in this House than my noble friend Lord Selborne did the other day when he said that no permanent settlement of this question on pure Party lines was possible in this country. It is a great question, and you may deal with it, if you like, on Party lines; but if it is settled on Party lines against the will of one of the great political Parties, when the country has had a little experience of the legislation which the present Government will doubtless carry into law, the pendulum will swing back very rapidly in the other direction, and a new Parliament will be elected which will put an end to the Parliament Bill.<lb/>
I really cannot understand how His Majesty's Government hope to settle the question by Dissolution. Supposing they are returned with a large majority as they anticipate&#x2014;will the country have voted in favour of the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill? That is impossible. The Bill would have to come before the new House of Commons and be considered by them, and nobody could tell how it would emerge. But if His Majesty's Government are defeated their Bill goes, and the question conies to the Unionist Party for solution. And supposing that the Government are supported by a largely diminished majority, can they pretend that that would give them strength from the country to pass the Bill they desire? This is the more true because I do not think that the issue is being fairly presented to the country. I will not say too much about such absurd statements as that the fight is whether the people shall govern themselves or be governed by 600 Peers. If that merely came from the minor speakers and writers of the Party opposite one would take no notice of it at all, but unfortunately it is repeated over and over again by Ministers in the highest position in the country.<lb/>
There is another point. The harm done by this House to Liberal legislation has been infinitely exaggerated and the corrective is often administered by innocent speakers like the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, who never ceases to sing the praises of the great deeds of the Liberal Party. But I need not dwell on this. What I want to know is what authority have His Majesty's Government for presenting
<col>864</col>
the Parliament Bill to the country as the one infallible basis upon which this question can be settled? Do they in their inmost minds really believe it? They might have believed it last spring; they could not have believed it when they consented to enter into Conference. Then they must have felt that at any rate other proposals deserved fair discussion. Can it be supposed that if, in the first meeting of that Conference, they had said to the members who represented the Unionist Party&#x2014; "this Bill, the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill is what we demand" the Conference would have lasted an hour? It is absurd. They must have discussed other proposals, doubtless more favourable to our views than those which they place before the country. Is it fair to the country, is it fair to themselves, is it an honest political proceeding to hold out this Bill as the only means of settling this great question when they themselves have been ready, on certain terms I suppose, to settle it in some other way? Will they tell us that it was on the proposals of this Bill that the representatives of this Party disagreed with them? I do not believe they will say anything of the kind, and unless they say it I venture to say that the case they are bringing before the country is a dishonest case altogether.<lb/>
Why are they doing this? We know very well. We had it hinted by the noble Earl the other day; we have since had it stated more plainly by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and we see it in full in Mr. Redmond's manifesto to-day. Why they are pressing on this Bill and insisting on the country giving them powers to pass it is simply because they think it will enable them to carry Home Rule for Ireland. No plan of Home Rule has ever been placed before the country by His Majesty's Government since that absurd Bill which fell stillborn in the House of Commons. Have they any Bill.? Have they any plan? Have they in their own minds made out what they would propose as a scheme of Home Rule for Ireland? Whether Home Rule, whether federation, whether Mr. Gladstone's plan or some totally different plan no one knows. They dare not propose any scheme of the sort to the electors of England; they dare not bring any such scheme openly before the English constituencies. They want to pass this Bill, and then to pass a Home Rule Bill without the assent of England. That is the reason which compels them to proceed as they are doing.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0437"/>
<col>865</col>
But if the Parliament Bill ever becomes question which we are discussing to-day law it may have results perhaps even more will ever be arrived at on the lines of the harmful than Home Rule for Ireland. It will deliver the country, in its Constitution, in the whole of its future, to the unchecked domination of a Single Chamber elected on a democratic. basis. Hitherto, it has been the right and duty of your Lordships' House, when the House of Commons passed a. Bill of grave importance the principle of which has never been accepted by the people, to consider whether it would not be justified in rejecting that Bill that the question might be referred to the people. It may very well be that in some other way the opinion of the people on a Bill the principle of which they had not sanctioned could be obtained, as it is obtained in other countries, before the Bill becomes law; but I will venture to say that it is absolutely necessary-for the future welfare and safety, not only of the United Kingdom, but of the Empire that there should be some means of ascertaining that will.<lb/>
I remember the House of Commons longer, perhaps, than any man who sits in it now. I take the greatest pride in the House of Commons, I would stand up for its privileges in every way, but history has shown that in many important cases the House of Commons has been absolutely wrong and has acted against the wishes of the people whom it was supposed to represent. You propose in the Parliament Bill to cut down the period of existence of the House of Commons. You propose to make the period quinquennial instead of septennial, but I am not quite sure whether, when the House of Commons gets such powers as it is proposed to give it, the day will not come when it will prolong its own existence for any term it likes. This, at any rate, is quite certain, that in our times the rapid and complete changes in public opinion might easily deprive the House of Commons of any real authority from the people within a period of much less than five years.<lb/>
If that should occur, what is it that you are proposing? You are proposing, in the name of political, freedom, to substitute arbitrary rule for Parliamentary government&#x2014;the arbitrary rule of a Single Chamber, governed itself by a Prime Minister and a Party caucus, and deprived of the liberty of free debate. I do not know what the fate of my noble friend's Resolutions may be or what may be the result of the General Election, but I am quite sure that no permanent settlement of the great

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02293"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Motion before your Lordships at this moment is that the House go into Committee to consider these Resolutions, and on that Motion I desire not to give a silent vote. We have been reminded, and reminded again in the striking and eloquent speech to which we have just listened, that this is one of the occasions, comparatively rare, I suppose, in our public life, when we are dealing with a matter deeper and further reaching than the ordinary political controversies of debate. I suppose every political question, every Bill that is to become an Act of Parliament, from a Budget or a Land Bill down to a Tramway Act, has in some degree a Constitutional aspect. But here the relation is not indirect and incidental; it is direct and fundamental. The problem we are handling, handling on its surface rather than at its depths, is nothing less than this, the nation's mode of governing itself, the way in which the nation means that its whole affairs shall be handled. We have got down to what the most stirring and original poet of our time&#x2014;if we may give a political application to his far wider words &#x2014;calls
<quote>The imperishable plinth of things</quote>
<quote>Seen and unseen, which touch our peace,</quote>
&#x2014;which "touch our peace" and, therefore, concern everybody.<lb/>
In the end, of course, this matter must be decided by the people at large. That is what we all want. The democracy, in a democratic age, must shoulder and carry its own responsibility, but it is often forgotten that to the poorest classes it matters most in the long run how the country is governed, because if the land is ill-governed and wrong laws are passed, it is they who in the end must pay the penalty. All history shows that under a weak or clumsy form of government, or the passing of wrong laws, the rich man. will somehow or other find means of protecting his own interests. The well-to-do man may be less well-to-do, perhaps, than lie was before, but the poor man will ultimately suffer grave wrong. It is they who are really hardest hit by bad or ill-considered laws. I apologise for such commonplaces, but they are not empty aphorisms. They definitely apply to the discussion which we have before us to-night.<lb/>

Parliament sitting here in. Westminster has varied duties, and among the mostimportant of these is&#x2014;the word Parliament reminds us of it&#x2014;that we should. discuss in public the great issues on which the people outside Parliament must ultimately vote, and thus secure that those pending issues, after public discussion within our walls, shall be more clearly and more widely understood. To prevent or to curtail the right debating of these questions here in Westminster and, therefore, the right presenting of them to the public, is, it seems to me, a violation of our duty and a belying of our very character as a Parliament.<lb/>
It is obvious that very few subjects can be more important than the constitution, character, and function of either of the two Houses of the Legislature and its relation to the other. In a country like ours, which has hitherto had an unwritten Constitution, it is necessarily a matter of the gravest perplexity and of difficulty, especially in periods of change, and it is one which eminently calls for quiet, persistent, and well-informed. thought. It is, therefore, exactly one of those subjects which responsible voters outside will understand better after it has been thoroughly ventilated and calmly discussed in public in both Houses of the Legislature. And yet it has proved extraordinarily difficult, for whatever reason, to obtain in this House an opportunity for such full, fair, and effective discussion of the suggested changes as would help people outside to understand better what is proposed and to weigh it wisely and. vote aright. When I say full, fair, and effective discussion I mean discussion of a practical sort, in which the two Parties genuinely co-operate, and especially in which time Government of the day takes the. full share belonging to the Executive. It is notorious that we have had nothing of the kind. When the noble Earl the Leader of the House says he is at a loss to understand how anybody can feel that there has been no adequate opportunity of discussion, I find it a little difficult to follow the course of his mind.</membercontribution></p>

<col>868</col>
already there had been an adequate opportunity of discussion. Three years ago an important Committee of your Lordships' House sat and discussed one of the two branches of the question&#x2014;namely, the character and qualifications of the members who should form part of the Upper House of Parliament; but that Report, important as it was, lost half of its weight because it had been found impossible by His Majesty's Government to take part in the Committee's deliberations. That Report lay for a long time on the Table of your Lordships' House; in my judgment far too long. I should have desired to have had Resolutions like these, based, I suppose, on that Report, brought forward. long ago. But it remained on the Table untouched, largely owing to the fact that effective discussion was extraordinarily difficult in face of the lack of interest in the subject shown by the Government of the day.<lb/>
At length, last March&#x2014;not last week&#x2014;the distinction is an important one&#x2014;a far-reaching Resolution affecting the hereditary rights of the Peerage was proposed, debated, and carried, but, again, the importance of that discussion was enormously diminished by the avowed indifference of the Government to the whole question. Then, in April last, certain Resolutions were proposed by the Government and debated. But where? Not in this House. No such opportunity was offered to us. Then came the lamentable death of the King, and public disputation was necessarily suspended. But during five long months eight prominent Statesmen sat with closed doors and deliberated on these matters. When the announcement was made that these eight men had failed. to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the question, the announcement was followed by expressions on the part of both Parties that those prolonged deliberations had not, in their judgment, been wasted, but that from the holding of such Conferences great good would come. I am entirely of that opinion. But only with one important qualification. One of the good things which we are waiting for and desiring could not possibly come out of that Conference. I mean the better informing of the people at large as to the issues which are going to be put before them. That Conference, whatever good influence it may have, could not, from the nature of the case, inform the people as to the merits of the case.<lb/>

<col>869</col>
After that Parliament reassembled, and those of us who wanted that the matter should be investigated, discussed, and ventilated were startled, and even staggered, to learn that a Dissolution was immediately to take place without any opportunity being offered to this House to discuss, far less to amend, the proposals of the Government. That calamity was averted by the action of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed it is only by a very wide departure from our ordinary methods of procedure that we are able now to squeeze in before the Dissolution comes and the curtain falls any discussion whatever on the great subject of the Government's Resolutions with regard to the relation of the two Houses of Parliament. I do not wish to suppose that anybody desires that the electors throughout the United Kingdom should give their votes without knowing what the particular issue is or what its outstanding points really are, but I do say it would have been lamentable, lamentable in no ordinary degree, had the opportunity been denied to this House, to noble Lords opposite, to the leaders of the Opposition, of showing how far they have been led, led, it may have been, by these recent discussions, to go towards the sort of solution which the Government has suggested. That opportunity is now theirs, and I hope they will use it for the country's sake, for the voters' sake, so that decisions may not be given on a confused or a misunderstood issue.<lb/>
I am not going into the merits of the Resolutions which we can discuss in Committee, if we go into Committee. It is obvious that they go very far along the same rails as those of the Government, and the country ought to know that. Of course there will be, there already have been, eager and vociferous taunts about the hour at which these Resolutions see the light. Even the Prime Minister, with all the weight of his great office and of his great personality, condescended to a gibe, which I venture to think he will, on consideration, feel was scarcely worthy either of his office or of himself, when he spoke of the action of the noble Marquess and his friends as t he action of men who were "to be hanged in a fortnight." The Prime Minister and the noble Marquess sat together for many weeks in the Conference room; I know nothing of what passed within those walls; but I venture to a confident belief that that sort of taunt found no expression
<col>870</col>
there. I think it is at once a worthier and a truer interpretation of the Resolutions now put forward by the Opposition to believe them to be the outcome of the quiet Conference discussions from which the Prime Minister told us that he hoped so much.<lb/>
My Lords, of other speeches made within the last few days I prefer to say nothing. The responsibility which rests just now upon public men&#x2014;and especially upon members of that. Conference&#x2014;for the exercise of scrupulous fairness of statement, sobriety of utterance, and avoidance of what can mislead or needlessly inflame men's minds is so immense as to be almost overwhelming. But so grave is it, and so capable is the occasion of being misused, that I am certain a warning is not out of place. On one sentence only of a notable East-end speech I should like to say a word. The orator, himself a member of the Conference which for a time hushed all our tongues, reminded his hearers of the raising of the battle-cry at Nottingham, when the Parliament war began in 1642. The speaker added&#x2014;"You know how that ended." Yes, my Lords, we do; but I am not so sure that the speaker fully remembered. That conflict, after years of miserable strife upon either side, ended. But how? It did not end at Whitehall. Pendulums, in unbalanced hours, swing far. It ended, not at Whitehall, but in the reaction of later Stuart clays, when not only the moral life, but the political reputation of this country sank to one of the lowest levels known to our history, when the ideals of progress and of freedom for which men had died were held in open contempt, and when cleavages in our common life were created and widened of which the baneful effects towards that very cause of progress and freedom remain with us to this day.<lb/>
I was impressed, as I think many of your Lordships were, by the speech of my noble friend Lord Selborne a few nights ago. He reminded us that a controversy of this sort is not settled by one Party triumphing over or trampling upon another, and his words have a peculiar weight in view of the South African story in which he has borne so conspicuous a part. It is absolutely true of the controversy in which the country is at this moment. engaged. The controversy is constantly spoken of as though it were a conflict
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0440"/>
<col>871</col>
between a party of the Peers on the one side and the people of England on the other. My Lords, the controversy is nothing of the kind. The differences, such as they are, are between one half of England and the other half, and no mere overriding of the minority&#x2014;and there is not a very large numerical difference between the minority and the majority after all&#x2014;will do what the nation needs. At such an hour we want, above all other things, that the people shall think clearly and vote fairly. Hence the immense gain of the discussions which are ours this week.<lb/>
I venture to join in the appeal made a few moments ago by the noble Viscount. It is an appeal which I am quite certain many thoughtful men of either Party desire to make just know&#x2014;an appeal to our Statesmen to avoid at an hour so grave and in face of issues so momentous any words which might needlessly embitter the controversy and might confuse the issue before the country; and in view of the common interests which are at stake, for everybody to be as fair as they will like to know that they have been when they look back upon it in after years. We look to these public men to help people outside to realise honestly the true facts of the present situation, to see as clearly the long bit of road whereon the controversialists go alongside and can travel together, as the hit of road where they diverge and part company. Thus only, by joint action, and by genuine contribution from either side of something that is needed for the whole, something that people must take pains rightly to understand&#x2014;thus only can we promote the sort of settlement which has been the pride of English common sense and common reasonableness in many a former controversy, a settlement in keeping with the traditions of our slow-fashioned continuous history, a history without parallel among the nations of the world. I hope your Lordships will agree to the Motion of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02296"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WEARDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I ask your Lordships to allow me to say a few words at this moment it is a little in consequence of the invitation addressed to us by my noble friend this afternoon, that the House, and particularly the independent members of it, should speak on this subject. I must say that when this House met a few days ago I viewed with great regret and considerable misgiving the position in which those with whom I generally act
<col>872</col>
in politics found themselves. Here was a great controversy connected with the constitution of the Second Chamber and with the relations of the two Houses of Parliament, true not by any means a new question, but one which has been brought more prominently to our notice within the last few months, suddenly to be referred to the judgment of the constituencies with only a very limited and insufficient discussion.<lb/>
In what position did we find ourselves? Twenty distinguished men forming the Cabinet had arrived at certain conclusions with regard to the settlement of this question, and had formulated those conclusions in a Bill known as the Parliament Bill. Subsequently the matter was referred to the further examination of eight eminent men representing the two Parties in the State. But those discussions, of which Parliament and the public outside know nothing whatever, are really the only discussions that have taken place with regard to this momentous change in our Constitution, and I maintain that the constitutional right of Parliament to deal with this matter after full discussion in both Houses was a condition precedent to any General Election. Therefore I confess I viewed with very great regret indeed the situation in which we found ourselves when this House reassembled, and I am accordingly glad that my noble friend has given us to-night an assurance that he and the Government will welcome a full discussion of the proposals put before us by the noble Marquess. No just cause suffers from discussion; no just cause is ever lost by free discussion amongst the British people, and I am perfectly certain that the case, in my judgment a very strong case, which we, the Liberal Party, have with regard to this matter, when fully and fairly discussed, would have given cause for reflection in all parts of the country, and we might have arrived at a settlement which would have been satisfactory to all Parties.<lb/>
Now what is the gravamen of our case? It is, in the first place, that this is an hereditary House. Surely the day is past when it is possible to contend that an hereditary House is a proper institution in a modern constitutional State? It is admitted now by noble Lords on the other side of the House&#x2014;I agree after compulsion&#x2014;that that is an impossible proposition, and they are therefore prepared to make considerable advances in the direction of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0441"/>
<col>873</col>
change. In my opinion those advances do not go far enough, because I think that the hereditary principle is one which is generally condemned by the people of this country. But, apart from that contention, what is the other consideration which is properly the subject of debate and of difference between the two Parties in the State? It is that the Liberal Party day by day see the ranks of the Tory Party packed with well-filled benches in your Lordships' House, 500 members ready to come down at the call of the Whip, while we, an unfortunate remnant on these benches, find ourselves unable to give that support to Liberal measures which is essential and proper in the interests of Liberal legislation. My Lords, that is an unfair position, and one to which the Liberal Party in this country will never assent and they cannot be expected to. It is a situation which is becoming worse every day, and it is consequently absolutely necessary that a solution should be found which should enable Liberal legislation passed by the House of Commons to proceed with success through the Second Chamber and become law- in accordance with the will of the people.<lb/>
Those being the objects in view, I maintain that there was no reason whatever why Parliament should not have had the right to fully discuss the proposals. That is my main proposition, because I am certain that this country is never going to be hustled into a hasty decision on this question. The country will always expect those whom they send to Parliament to return to them only with a case that has been thoroughly debated and fully matured, and for which we are able to give reasons and conclusions that are absolutely conscientious and sincere. if I, as a Liberal Member of Parliament, were asked by my constituents whether the Parliament Bill had been discussed by Parliament, what should: I be able to say? I should be obliged to answer No, and that is why I ask my noble friend and his colleagues to at all events go as far as this, not to allow their Bill to be regarded as an unchangeable ultimatum incapable of modification or improvement, for if they do they will drive thousands of hesitating electors into the opposite camp. Let them be as firm as I am in their convictions to-day, but do not let them suppose that the deliberations of twenty eminent members of the Cabinet are sufficient to settle this matter without
<col>874</col>
further reference to Parliament. That should be understood as soon as possible.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to some of the proposals contained in the Motion of the noble Marquess. I am certainly not here to support them as they stand, and I have very little to say except with regard to one of them&#x2014;the Referendum. I have always been a friend of the Referendum. I have not been converted to it by the noble Marquess. I have constantly advocated it in public meetings before it ever entered the mind of the noble Marquess, who has adopted it with some precipitation, it seems to me, in view of the dangers that confront his Party. We have heard a great deal of the risks and difficulties of the Referendum. I do not think that it is such a difficult matter as my noble friend seems to think. It is certainly not that extraordinarily expensive method to which he refers. I very much doubt, if the matter were gone into, whether it would be found that a Referendum, properly conducted, would cost more than &#x00A3;200,000 or &#x00A3;250,000&#x2014;a large sum of money, I admit&#x2014;but everybody knows that the Referendum would not be an instrument to which recourse would be had on every possible occasion. It would only be in those cases where the two Houses were unable to agree, and I hope those cases would be few indeed.<lb/>
We have been told that one of the objections to the Referendum is that certain desirable measures would never be carried. It is sometimes said, for instance, that Home Rule would never be carried by Referendum. My Lords, I deny it. I am a life-long Home Ruler. I have been faithful to the cause of Home Rule when many of my right hon. friends were not quite so zealous with regard to it. I am as faithful now as I ever was to the cause, but my belief to-day&#x2014;and it is a belief which I shared with my illustrious leader, Mr. Gladstone, in the old days&#x2014;is that Home Rule is only to be obtained by convincing the people of its necessity and justice, and not by irregular methods or force. I believe, if that method had been employed and had continued to be employed with real persistence, that in the end we should have seen Home Rule carried in a. way that would have satisfied Ireland and been a cause of prosperity and peace to the United Kingdom. There is another subject which it is said would never under any circumstances be acceptable
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0442"/>
<col>875</col>
to the country in the form of a Referendum&#x2014;temperance reform and the licensing question. Again I say I do not at all share that view. I believe that if a Licensing Bill which appealed to the moral sense of the people were referred to the judgment of the people free from all other considerations, it would enlist sympathy and support from many unexpected quarters and receive their sanction and support. Therefore I say that in my opinion the Referendum would afford a means of carrying these measures of reform that we so much desire to see.<lb/>
I quite admit, however, that the Referendum would be a bar to certain legislation of what I may call a wild or irrational character. I think I shall be in order when I say that the Women's Suffrage Bill would in all probability not receive the sanction of the country if referred to them in the form of a. Referendum, because it is admitted on all hands that Woman Suffrage, however much it may be desired by a certain distinguished minority of women, is strongly opposed by the great majority of women themselves. It is certainly not supported by the great majority of men, and in those circumstances I am bound to say that a Women's Suffrage Bill referred to the people by means of the Referendum and refused by them, would be properly refused by them. It is very desirable that these different forms of settling a dispute between the two Houses should be thoroughly debated, and I ask the Government most sincerely not to bar out of consideration this desirable alternative of the Referendum. My own belief is that the people of this country when they come to examine this matter more closely will come to the conclusion that, on the whole, the most democratic, the wisest, and the easiest solution is to refer grave issues between the two Houses of Parliament to the judgment of the people themselves. The people should decide, and as a democrat myself I ask that suitable machinery for recording their decision should be brought into being.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02297"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships on this side of the House must have listened to the speech we have just heard not merely with interest but with a certain amount of partial approval. I am sorely tempted to follow my noble friend into dealing with Women's Suffrage, but 1 am afraid I should be slightly out of order if I did so. It is
<col>876</col>
difficult to take part in this debate without, to some extent, repeating in other words the remarks which have been made by others of your Lordships who can speak with far greater authority and eloquence than myself, but I entertain so strong an opinion upon the subject now under discussion that I am unwilling to give a silent vote, and I would therefore ask your Lordships' indulgence while I very briefly explain my views, more especially on the question of the treatment of what are called Money Bills.<lb/>
My Lords, there is a very marked difference between the proposals of the Government and those contained in the Resolution of the noble Marquess, not merely in respect to the tribunal which shall decide whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill, but also in respect to the attributes of that tribunal. It is quite conceivable that as regards the special point to which I am about to allude, the Bill and the Resolution mean the same, thing, but we have to look not to what the Bill means, but to what it says, and in respect to what they say there is a great difference between the Bill and the Resolution. The definition laid down in the Bill brought in by the Government is rigid; the Resolution of the noble Marquess is to a far greater extent elastic. In the proposal of the Government it is laid down that if any Bill is certified by the Speaker only to deal with the imposition of a tax it is to be considered a Money Bill, and that therefore the right of the Second Chamber to intervene is barred. I conceive that under the strict terms of the clause the Speaker will not be able to go by one hair's breadth outside the text of subsection (2), Clause 1. He will not be able, in any way, to consider the indirect or ulterior consequences if the Bill is passed into law. He will not be able to take cognisance of the fact that the ostensible may be very different from the real objects of the Bill. He will only have to certify to a fact, and that fact is that the Bill only deals with the imposition of a tax. If he is to be allowed more latitude than this, then I maintain that the extent of the latitude which is to be allowed to him should in some way be indicated in the Bill itself.<lb/>
To state a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, under the terms of this clause, rigidly interpreted, if the House of Commons proposed to impose a special tax on all bald men, or on all men with red hair, the Speaker
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0443"/>
<col>877</col>
would be obliged to certify that the Bill only dealt with that tax, and with no other subject, and would be forced to certify that it was a Money Bill. But, my Lords, it is easy to conceive a case which is far less imaginary and absurd than this. Take the case of the Super-Tax. The imposition of that tax did not encounter any serious opposition in either House of Parliament. Yet it is quite clear that in adopting it Parliament has sanctioned a novel and very important principle of fiscal legislation which will require the utmost care and watchfulness in its execution. Supposing the House of Commons were to impose a tax of 50 or 100 per cent. on incomes which exceeded a certain amount. Under the strict terms of this Bill the Speaker would be obliged to certify that the Bill contained nothing beyond the imposition of the tax. He would be unable to take into consideration the fact that the tax was not imposed for revenue purposes, but in order to equalise incomes. I know I shall be told again, as I have been told before, that the common sense of the House of Commons and the pressure of public opinion outside will always be able to prevent a Socialistic enormity of this sort being perpetrated. But from what we know of the views entertained by the extremists of the Radical Party, and from what we know also of the pressure which they are able to exert, it appears to me that common sense is a very weak reed on which to rely in order to save, not only land-owners and capitalists, but all who possess property of any kind, from the Jedburgh justice which the sworn foes of these classes, if they had the power, would certainly mete out to them.<lb/>
My Lords, so long as we were living under an unwritten Constitution we could afford to rely on common sense. It was in the essence of such a Constitution that a few rather vague general principles should be laid down, and that then reliance should be placed on the common sense of all concerned to exercise the rather shadowy powers vested in them with caution and moderation. But for good or evil&#x2014;and let me say I think very much for evil&#x2014;the unwritten Constitution has broken down. The relations between the two Houses have to be defined. In that case I say they should be defined with the utmost precision, if precision is possible; or, if that is impossible, as I believe is the case in respect to Money Bills, then on the face of the Bill a
<col>878</col>
certain elasticity should be allowed to those authorities who have to interpret the general intentions of Parliament. Under the Resolution of the noble Marquess a certain degree of elasticity is secured; it introduces the very important words that a Joint Committee of the two Houses may consider whether the Bill is "purely financial in character." These words manifestly open the door very much wider than the rigid text proposed by the Government. It cannot, indeed, be said that the definition of the Government is wanting in precision, although it appears to me to be wholly wanting in elasticity. On the contrary, it is disastrously precise. But, my Lords, at what cost is this precision gained? It is gained, I maintain, at the cost of sweeping away in one sentence of one clause the principal guarantee which the existence of a Second Chamber secures. It is gained at the cost of placing the Second Chamber of this country in a. position of marked inferiority to its counterpart in any other civilised country in the world. If the text of the Bill now under discussion is rigorously interpreted, I venture to assert that there is no fiscal enormity&#x2014;indeed, I may go further, and say that by skilful drafting there is scarcely any important change in the general legislation of the country&#x2014;which cannot be abstracted from the cognisance of the Second Chamber.<lb/>
We have recently been discussing how the Second Chamber should in future be composed, and the noble Earl the Leader of this House has given the Resolutions which we have passed a partial blessing, and has even gone so far as to say that they contain some modified elements of virtue, but that the time for discussing them has not yet arrived. Really, my Lords, if this Bill in its present form is to become the law of the land it matters very little how the Second Chamber is composed, for whether it be wholly hereditary, or wholly elected, or, as your Lordships wish, partly hereditary and partly elected, it will certainly be shorn of all real power. I maintain that the clause of the Bill on which I am now dilating by itself virtually constitutes all the most essential features of single-Chamber Government. I am, of course, perfectly aware that we are told in the Preamble of the Bill that a reformed Second Chamber will in due time be created; in other words, we are invited first to shiver the ancient Constitution of this country to atoms, and then we are told that we are to take up
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0444"/>
<col>879</col>
the fragments and out of them we are to patch up some sorry make-believe of a Second Chamber which is to take the place of the priceless institutions which have been handed down to us by our forefathers &#x2014;institutions which have weathered the storm when the whole of Europe was in convulsions, and which have so far been the envy and admiration of the whole civilised world.<lb/>
I am very fully convinced that many of the members of the Liberal Party are quite sincere in their intention to create a Second Chamber, and I am also very fully convinced that if this Bill passes into law their efforts to create an effective Second Chamber will be in vain, for their very honourable intentions will be baulked by the extremists of their own Party, who do not wish for any Second Chamber at all; and, moreover, the work of destruction accomplished by this Bill will be so thorough and complete that my firm belief is that any reconstruction will be well-nigh impossible. Indeed, my Lords, there is a great deal to be said in favour of not attempting any reconstruction. I am not at all sure that it would not, in the general interests of the nation, be wiser to act as I think the noble Earl on the Cross Benches suggested in a speech he made sonic months ago&#x2014;that is to say, to bring the appearance more into harmony with the reality, and openly and avowedly to set up a single-Chamber system instead of attempting to delude the country with the idle <i>simulacrum</i> of a Second Chamber which would be perfectly impotent. What is the use of having a drag chain hanging outside the coach in order to lull the passengers into a false sense of security when it is perfectly well known that at the critical moment the drag would be unable to act in order to arrest the speed of the vehicle down-hill?<lb/>
From the first moment this question began to be discussed it surely must have been apparent to every thinking man that the only statesmanlike way of proceeding was to allow the work of construction to proceed <i>pari passu</i> with that of destruction. We are now told that the execution of this programme was impossible because the Conference has broken dawn. The breakdown of the Conference is indeed infinitely to be regretted, and I quite agree with what was said the other day by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh, that it is also very much to be regretted that we cannot be informed of the reasons of the failure. I
<col>880</col>
admit that, speaking from a brief, it is easy to make out a very strong case to show that inasmuch as the eight very distinguished gentlemen who recently considered this question were unable to arrive at an agreement, therefore there would be even a less chance of agreement if the circle engaged in discussion were enlarged. This aspect of the case was stated the other day with his usual ability by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, but I must be permitted to say that I think this argument rather savours of what is generally called special pleading, and that it is stronger in appearance than in reality. It is surely conceivable that the four gentlemen on either side, though reluctant to pledge their followers to a course of action on some important point when the opinion of those followers was unknown or doubtful, would have been in a very different position if the whole question had been discussed publicly. They would then have been in a position to know what were the extreme limits of concession on either side. To my mind it is nothing to the point to indicate that there is a large Conservative majority in this House, or to allude to former utterances of individual members of this House.<lb/>
My Lords, we have recently been hearing a good many witticisms on the subject of death-bed repentances. I notice in this morning's papers that one of the most irrepressible colleagues of the noble Earl opposite made some witticisms on this subject. I will read what he said because it is a good illustration of what the noble Earl the Leader of the House called the inaccuracies of the various accuracies of electoral speeches. The Home Secretary said that the Resolutions of the noble Marquess were "vague, complicated, panic-stricken trash." For my own part I may say that I am not in the least ashamed to own that circumstances alter cases. It will be admitted that no question can be settled until an opportunity for settlement arises, and it is only now that an opportunity for settling this matter has arisen. I believe that there are many amongst us who, if they had been brought face to face with the question, would in no wise have been scared by the hobgoblin of consistency, that least cardinal and most frequently violated of political principles.<lb/>
The country wanted, and I believe still wants, this question settled by an amicable settlement. I do not believe there is a sensible man either inside or outside this
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0445"/>
<col>881</col>
House who, if he had been brought to close quarters with the question, would not have been sobered by the magnitude of the crisis and by the enormous importance of the interests at stake, and who would not therefore have been prepared to make very large sacrifices of his personal opinion in order to arrive at a settlement. However, my Lords, the Government, most unfortunately to my mind, have decided not to make any further attempt to come to an agreement. In the words of the Prime Minister they have declared war. Regardless of the historic past and noble traditions of this House, of which noble Lords opposite equally with ourselves are members, they have decided not to endeavour to persuade but to coerce the House of Lords. I think that is very much to be regretted. Moreover, I feel perfectly convinced that there are many who are not of our way of thinking now who, if their Bill eventually becomes law, will rue the day, and that at no very remote period. It is perfectly impossible for any human being to predict what the ultimate consequences of the grave step of passing this measure into law will be; but that they will be very serious cannot for one moment be doubted. Whatever they may be, I venture to assert that the real responsibility will rest, not with your Lordships' House, but with the Government of the day in having needlessly precipitated a crisis which I firmly believe not only could have been avoided but would have been avoided by many, probably by most, of the eminent Statesmen who preceded them in the guidance of the historic Party to which they belong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02298"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just sat down has dotted the i's and crossed the t's of the remarks addressed to the House by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Weardale, but it will not have escaped the attention of the House, I think, that not one word in reply to Lord Weardale's appeal has been uttered by any member on the benches opposite. Lord Weardale, who has, I believe, hitherto been known as a good Party man and a consistent supporter of the Government, has addressed to his leaders an eloquent appeal to desist from the mad policy which they are now pursuing. He has pointed out to them that they are pursuing a course which has no precedent in history, that they are asking the electors of this country to consider a Bill which has been entirely unconsidered by those whom they have elected to consider
<col>882</col>
such measures, and. he has made an appeal to them to somewhat modify the rigorous attitude they have taken up. That appeal, my Lords, has fallen on deaf ears. I am not astonished that there has been no answer given, because there is no answer to give. Noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite have taken up a position which is not only untenable, but which I believe in their heart of hearts they know to be untenable. I remember seeing at the Brussels Exhibition a waxwork group of His Majesty's Ministers. It was a very handsome group, and I venture to say that for all practical purposes in this debate that waxwork group would have been about as useful to answer Lord Weardale as the noble Lords who sit on the Front Bench opposite. They have not followed the real instincts of their own convictions, but have allowed themselves to drift under impulses that are stronger than their own. If Lord Weardale gets no answer because there is none, there is no reason why this House should not seriously consider and place before the country the position as it seems to itself.<lb/>
I am one of those who think that from many points of view this House might well stand upon its own record, that its past history shows it has nothing to be ashamed of in what it has done, and that on the great occasions when it has exerted itself and taken decisions sometimes at variance with the other House it has been shown in the main that the House of Lords has interpreted faithfully the will of the people. It can also recall with satisfaction that. many of the great reforms have been initiated by the House of Lords rather than by the House of Commons. We are not concerned at this moment, however, with the historical record of the House of Lords, upon which your Lordships might well be content to stand. We are concerned with the actions of a Government who pay no attention to history or to precedent and are ready to inflame the passions of the people by every device and artifice they can think of. Your Lordships have to meet a situation in which false issues have been created, and in meeting that situation we have to deal with the facts as we find them now.<lb/>
If you were starting to create a Constitution for this country. I do not suppose that there is any member of this House who would create the Constitution as it is now. Neither the House of Commons nor the House of Lords would be created as it
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0446"/>
<col>883</col>
stands now if you were creating a new Constitution, and the action this House has already taken admits that, whatever we may think of the past history of this House, we are not so blind as not to see that there are changes which can be made for its improvement, and, I would venture to think, for its strengthening. But it must not be thought, and I for one would not admit, that the charges brought against this House in support of this so-called Parliament Bill are in any sense well founded. It is not the case that the House of Lords has resisted the will of the people. It is not the case that it has opposed a "blank veto" to all Liberal legislation. Your Lordships have, as a matter of fact, taken a share in passing all the Liberal legislation for which the noble Earl opposite took credit to the Government. And if, looking at facts only, the House will turn its recollection to the chief measures with which the Government has been concerned since it came into office, I think it will be seen that the House of Lords has not decided finally against the will of the people, and, in the second place, that the proposals made by the noble Marquess in the Resolutions now before the House are proposals which would in every single case have met any difficulties which might have arisen in regard to those measures.<lb/>
Your Lordships have been accused of having resisted the will of the people with regard to the Education Bill. I have often asked which of the Government's Education Bills represented the will of the people, but I have never yet succeeded in getting from a Liberal an answer to my question. If the first Education Bill represented the will of the people, why were two others brought in of quite a different complexion and with quite different principles underlying them? Disestablishment of the Church in Wales is another of the great causes in respect of which the House of Lords is supposed to stand in the way, but since the present Government came into power they have not brought in any Bill for Welsh or any other disestablishment. It is all very well to say that the House would not pass such a Bill if it were brought in. The Government, for reasons best known to themselves, have not dared to bring in a measure which they say the people are panting for. In regard to Home Rule, one of the great causes which they say this House stands in the way of and as to which they say your Lordships are the enemies of
<col>884</col>
the people, the Government's solution of the question by the Irish Councils Bill was not thrown out by the House of Lords but by the Irish Convention under Mr. Redmond. As to the great issue of the Budget, if the House of Lords did delay "The People's Budget" the result of the election was that your Lordships acquiesced in the will of the people; and as to all the smaller measures which this Government has introduced since it came into office there is not one which the House of Lords has finally refused, or which could not, by the process suggested of Joint Conferences or Referendum, have been satisfactorily settled by the ascertainment of the will of the people.<lb/>
The real truth, it seems to me, is that there is no answer to Lord Weardale's question as to why there is a General Election at this moment. It does not arise because the Government have failed to pass any of their measures into law. Since the last election no Bill of any importance has been rejected by the House of Lords, and the chief measure upon which the Government are going to the country is one which has not been produced in the House of Commons and has not been debated in either House. The Parliament Bill is the Bill on which they are going to the country, and the real truth surely is that the Government are not so anxious to pass particular measures into law as to placate their allies at as cheap a price as possible, and if that price be the destruction of the ancient House of Lords, that is a price they are perfectly willing to pay.<lb/>
The noble Earl who leads the House argued against the principle of the Referendum which is embodied in these Resolutions. I am but a young student of Constitutional history, but I do not suppose that any one can have paid any attention, however slight, to these great Constitutional questions without agreeing that the introduction of the principle of the Referendum would be a gigantic step and a very bold experiment. The Referendum as suggested in these Resolutions is one which does not find a place on exactly similar lines in any Constitution in the world, but this country has led the world in Constitution making ever since it was a country. We are faced with a problem which is different from that presented to any other country, and surely the experiment of the Referendum is one which might well be tried. It has been found to work well on different lines in other countries, and I for one am
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0447"/>
<col>885</col>
delighted to support it, not so much on its pure merits as a piece of Constitution making, but because it does seem to me a clear and direct way of solving deadlocks between the two Houses and one to which no real democrat can possibly object. I do not believe that the awful picture of expense which has been drawn up will in any case prove to be a true one. Once you have established the principle of the Referendum as an ultimate source of reference of any question arising between the two Houses, it will probably be found in actual practice that the prospect of a Referendum will be a large factor in determining an agreement between the two Houses, and if you once establish the practice it will in all probability not be very frequently made use of.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Weardale, thinks that by means of a. Referendum he will be able to pass Home Rule, licensing reform, and many other measures dear to his heart. I do not quarrel with his prophecy, although differ from it. But in any case, whatever he or I may think of the merits of the particular measures which may or may not be passed by a Referendum, there can be no question whatever that if they are passed by such a Referendum they are passed by the will of the people and not by the will of a chance majority; and bitterly as I may be opposed to the noble Lord's idea of Home Rule being carried by Referendum, I can imagine no more satisfactory way of settling big Constitutional questions than by ascertaining the wishes of the majority of may fellow-countrymen.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02300"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I do not care to go further than the actual words of the Resolution, and I imagine that at this particular stage it would be impossible to define the exact phraseology and the methods for the carrying out of the Referendum.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02301"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Viscount's pardon. I thought I caught the phrase, "the majority of my fellow-countrymen."</membercontribution></p>
<col>886</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02302"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: I do not quite follow the noble Earl's point, because I fail to see how you could pass anything without the approval of a majority of my fellow-countrymen; it could not be done by a majority of the countrymen of some other nation. Perhaps I should have used. the phrase "the majority of the electorate." I am glad to find teat the noble Earl in dealing with the Referendum apprehends that it may be applied in the case of any question with regard to the imposition of a tariff. He laid great stress upon that argument, and I am glad to hear from him, as a member of a Party which has been loudly proclaiming for a long while that Tariff Reform is dead, that he has some apprehension that there may in the near future be a tariff against which it is necessary to guard. But leaving that on one side, surely the Referendum could not be put into practice in the case of measures which are in their essence purely financial. I do not see any argument against the proposition that, on whatever questions you may have a Referendum, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to put into practice the Referendum in the case of financial measures which it is not possible. long to delay. It is quite true that in the. last two years we have got accustomed, for various reasons, to His Majesty's Government keeping the Budget hung up for a very long time, but, as a matter of regular practice, I feel perfectly certain it would. be against general convenience for purely financial measures to be subjected by means of a Referendum to the vote of the people.<lb/>
But, my Lords, whatever may be the merits of the Referendum or the noble Marquess's proposals for dealing with this question as an alternative to the system proposed by His Majesty's Government, our proposals have in my mind the supreme merit that they do not leave untouched, as the Parliament Bill does, the anomalies upon which the Government case has been rested. The Government have rested their case against the House of Lords very largely, if not entirely, upon the anomalies in the composition of this House, its hereditary character, and so forth; and when it comes to the utterances of their colleagues and subordinates on public platforms it is those aspects, and even more personal aspects, of the House which are made the theme of invective and ridicule. If there is anything anomalous in this House, not one step have His Majesty's Government
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0448"/>
<col>887</col>
taken to alter it or to co-operate in altering it, and the Parliament Bill leaves untouched all those anomalies, if they be anomalies, upon which the main portion of the case of the Government is framed. On the other hand, the scheme of the noble Marquess marches on truly progressive lines, and realises that a scheme for solving this question must deal with the House of Lords limited in numbers and reformed, and if it were only for that reason I should feel that the noble Marquess's scheme had great advantages over the scheme of the Government.<lb/>
Then if it is contended that these Resolutions are vague in character and need defining in particular, I would not only say that it is necessary that Resolutions of this character should deal with generalities, but I would venture to say that any one who carefully compares the Resolutions with the text of. the Parliament Bill &#x2014;which I dare say a great many people have not read&#x2014;will find that the looseness and vagueness of the Parliament Bill is far more acute than any vagueness which rests in these Resolutions. My Lords, I only rose to give my hearty support to the general scheme contained in the Resolutions of the noble Marquess. I am not learned in Constitutional law, but I am animated to-day by a feeling of the unreality of the discussion in which we are taking part. I have no doubt that there will not be that unreality in the discussion which takes place in the country. There will be no answer in the country, as there has been no answer in this House, to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Wear-dale, as to why this election is taking place. But it will be seen, if the attempt is made, as I suppose it will be made, to present the issue before the people as an issue of the Peers <i>versus</i> the People, that that is not the issue, and that the real issue is as to two alternative schemes for dealing with the great Constitutional question&#x2014;on the one side the majority of the Peers fighting for a real reform, and on the other His Majesty's Government fighting for a measure which is no reform at all, but which destroys the powers of. one House while leaving to it all those privileges of caste and position which have been most abused by members of the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02303"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I earnestly hope that the House will accept the Motion of the noble Marquess on the
<col>888</col>
Front Opposition Bench and go into Committee to discuss the weighty and well-considered Resolutions which he has placed on the Paper. We have heard very little to-day as to the details of these Resolutions, but that will come, no doubt, later in the debate. At the same time some points have been brought prominently forward, among others the merits of the Referendum and the effects of its introduction compared with the Bill of His Majesty's Government. So much has been said in favour of the Referendum that I feel rather diffident in alluding to the subject again, but objections have been raised&#x2014;I do not think so much here as outside&#x2014;to the Referendum on the ground that the country will have already given its voice on the particular questions to which the Referendum would be applied, and that therefore it is superfluous to ask for that opinion again. That objection appears to me not at all sound.<lb/>
At a General Election a great many matters come before the electorate, and in ordinary circumstances if one wishes to elicit the opinion of a man on any particular subject one does not confuse his ideas by asking him his opinion on three or four other things at the same time. At this election, for instance, we shall have Home Rule, Tariff Reform, the education question, and the Church, and others of which no doubt every one will hear enough and more than enough in the next few weeks. All these have attractions for different electors in various degrees, some of whom also may be influenced by the fascinating prospect held out to them of absorbing or assimilating other people's property, a bond of union described by an American politician as the "almightycohesion of public plunder." It may well happen that an elector gives his vote for a candidate although not agreeing with him on all the questions but agreeing with him on the majority. It may be that he thinks one question of such transcendent importance that he may not have troubled himself much about the others and may not have formed a decided opinion on the particular measure proposed to be submitted to him by the Referendum. For instance, a man might be so devotedly attached to Free Trade as to give his vote for a Free Trade and Home Rule candidate without much considering the question of Home Rule. I naturally use this illustration because it is one that comes home to every loyal subject of His Majesty the King in Ireland, but the same would apply in other instances. But
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0449"/>
<col>889</col>
when the Home Rule question came to be submitted to him by Referendum and his thoughts were turned away from the question of Free Trade, the elector would see that there was no half-way house between the Union as it stands and the separation of the two countries, and he might then give his vote on the merits of the question. I hope, therefore, that the House will fully consider this point of view.<lb/>
I quite admit that there arc difficulties, but there is no question with regard to which you cannot find difficulties. What the House has to consider is whether the outcome of these difficulties is so great that either the present state of things or that under the Bill as introduced by His Majesty's Government would be preferable. I certainly believe that the acceptance of the scheme of the noble Marquess would have a most beneficial effect, and that in any case it would not constitute such a breach in the Constitution of the country as would the acceptance of the Government's Bill, under which the vote of this House would be nullified by a majority in the House of Commons which might not fully represent the opinion of the country. I therefore support the Resolutions of the noble Marquess, and I feel sure they will receive the support of the country at large.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02305"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there was once a large and rather quarrelsome family who went, about a great deal in their motor car in a hilly country. They had a brake fitted to their car which acted automatically whenever they were bordering on an unconstitutional or illegal speed. At last this family became impatient. They said, "This hereditary brake is becoming unendurable; it is more than 800 years old; it stopped us when we were rushing down Education Hill; it stopped us again opposite a public house whose licence we intended to withdraw, and, worst of all, it stopped us when we were scorching down Finance Valley on our way to the Bank to draw out our yearly income and our unearned increment." Now any reasonable family holding these opinions would have tried to get another brake. But these people just took their brake off and went out driving without one in their hilly country with their new Irish chauffeur at the steering
<col>890</col>
wheel. They ran over a great many people before they came to utter smash. Unfortunately those in the car were not the only persons who were hurt in the collision which eventually stopped them. Whether the smash took place when they were descending their first hill, or later on, I do not at present know. Yet there were plenty of good brakes in the market, the Elected or Selected Brakes, and the Referendum brake. The best of them, in my opinion, was the Referendum brake.<lb/>
The Referendum is, I believe, the only possible solution of the problems with which we are confronted. It is an honest method of giving the people what they want, instead of what a coalition of. Parties may wish to force down their throats, and it would save us from the log-rolling that has been the curse of the United States. The Referendum would not benefit one Party more than another&#x2014;it would be an advantage to the nation as a. whole. If every voter answered Yes or No on all questions on which the two Houses were unable to come to a satisfactory agreement, a far truer representation of the wishes of the people would be arrived at, than as the result of a General Election, when the issues are so crossed that all sorts of mandates are claimed by one side and denied by the other. With the Referendum the people would get what they want&#x2014;they certainly do not get it now. No Constitutional change should ever take place without consultation of the people by this means. If this House is to lose the power of appealing to a General Election before passing a Bill, some other institution should be called into existence to prevent the people being deprived of their rights. The unequal distribution of seats as regards population is one of the chief evils from which the country is now suffering. With a Referendum all votes would be of equal value. Any attempt to equalise the voting power of Romford and Kilkenny would, of course, be resented by Mr. Redmond's Home, Rulers, but it ought to commend itself to English and Scottish constituencies. In Switzerland the Referendum has been found so convenient that it is used to settle all sorts of petty matters connected with local government as well, as the more important business affecting the whole country.<lb/>
I have read a good deal about the Swiss Referendum, but as a variety of languages
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0450"/>
<col>891</col>
are spoken in Switzerland and as there are twenty-two sovereign cantons in that country, each having its own laws and its own government, it is better perhaps that I should take illustrations of the working of a Referendum in Anglo-Saxon communities, whose language is the same as ours, and whose laws and customs are nearly all derived from those existing in this country. The Referendum is recognised in all the States of North America, except Delaware, for changes in the Constitution. And there is in that country a local Referendum which in some States has greatly developed. In Iowa the advance has almost reached the point which the Referendum has attained in Switzerland. The Referendum has been tried with satisfactory results in Australia, in New Zealand, and in Natal. There is one point about a Referendum which may appeal to Radicals and Socialists. You cannot say that there is anything hereditary about it. The noble Earl opposite, in his speech on Monday last, said that the question of a Referendum bristles with difficulties. I confess I thought that that might be the case until I read the Natal Referendum Act. That Act is short and clear: it is one of the easiest Acts to understand that I have ever read. There is no plural voting. The question is short and simple&#x2014;"Are you in favour of the proposed draft South Africa Act? If you are in favour of that Act make your cross in the square opposite the word 'Yes.' If you are against it, make your cross opposite the word 'No.'" It would be a very easy matter to draft similar Bills suited to the circumstances of this country. I wished to bring before the British public the materials for forming an estimate of the value of a Referendum. Last March, in compliance with a request of mine, all the documents connected with the Natal Referendum were printed as a Parliamentary Paper. The reference number is Cd. 5,099 and the cost 1&#x00BD;d. But it is a very difficult thing to educate an electorate in ten days or a. fortnight as to what the Referendum means. We are now ten days from the first polling day, and that is a very short time in which to explain to the electorate the real meaning of a Referendum. I believe that the cost of a Referendum in this country has been greatly exaggerated. I do not for a moment accept Mr. Lloyd George's estimate of two millions. I put that statement away in the same pigeon hole with the statements about Chinese Slavery and German black
<col>892</col>
bread. I am glad to find that the Referendum is to be a plank in the platform from which the Unionists are going to appeal to the people. If once it is adopted in this country I feel certain that it will grow in popularity as it did in America.<lb/>
My chief objection to the Parliament Bill is that it will give us Home Rule, and my principal objection to Home Rule is that it is a step to the complete independence of Ireland&#x2014;a step that will be impossible to retrace and which will make our naval position absolutely untenable. I would suggest to all platform speakers at this Election that they should have a large map of Great Britain and Ireland hung up in front of them so as to be able to impress upon the electorate what the position of England and Scotland would be in case of war should Ireland be independent and on friendly terms with a foreign Power, and with Lough Swilly, Lough Foyle, Belfast, Greenore, and Dublin Bay affording protection to an enemy's mine-layers, torpedo boats, submarines, and small cruisers. How on earth could our trade reach the Clyde or Liverpool? I hope that our Glasgow friends will study that little question of geography. Look at the indented coast of the South and West of Ireland which gives unequalled shelter for small vessels, at short distances from one another, backed up by Cork, Youghal, Dungarvan, Waterford, Wexford, and Dublin, which are still nearer to our coasts. How do our merchant ships expect to get in and out of Liverpool, Cardiff, or Bristol if such shelters are available for an enemy's smaller vessels? Cardiff and Liverpool voters should think twice before voting for a Bill that will give Home Rule. No amount of International Treaties will prevent an enemy from strewing mechanical mines near our harbours if by so doing he thinks that he can starve us out and thus not only finish the war but dictate a Treaty of Peace. Recollect that it is not necessary that a vessel should be regularly built as a man-of-war in order to enable her to stop a merchant vessel. A very small gun mounted on a fast merchant ship commanded by an officer whose previous experiences at sea have been acquired in the merchant service, but who will then be holding a temporary commission in the enemy's Navy, is all that is necessary to stop or to sink an unarmed merchant ship. When I was on the coast of North America during the Civil War in the Sixties the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0451"/>
<col>893</col>
blockading squadrons contained numbers of vessels originally built as blockade runners which had been captured and armed by the Northerners.<lb/>
If a similar vessel sighted one of our cruisers she would run for safety to the nearest Irish harbour. The enemy's cruisers on the coasts of Ireland will be like rabbits running in and out of their burrows whenever they see one of our cruisers or one of our merchant ships. You will not find a single naval officer who believes in the possibility of feeding England if Ireland was in alliance with a hostile Power. If perpetual peace could be guaranteed the question of Home Rule would, as far as it concerns Englishmen, stand upon a very different footing, but if Ireland was independent she could always dictate her terms in peace time by threatening to ally herself with another Power on any little difference of opinion that we had with her, and in that way Ireland would be completely the master of England. As Home Rule is to be the price paid to the Irish for their support of this Bill, I have thought it right to point out some of the dangers of granting it, and the necessity of a Referendum to the country with the home Rule Bill as a separate issue when it has passed the Commons. It would be far better to wait and to continue the policy of trying to kill Home Rule by kindness.<lb/>
I deem the actual composition of a Second Chamber to be a matter of comparatively small importance so long as it retains the power of appealing to the people, either by Referendum or by a General Election, and that its membership has an element of permanency, which would, I conceive, he met by their being elected or selected either for life or for twelve or fifteen years. I cannot see anything in the Parliament Bill to prevent the House of Commons from passing another Bill to make themselves a permanent and indissoluble body. They have only to pass a Bill to this effect&#x2014;<lb/>
<quote>Whereas the country is in a disturbed condition the General Election is to be postponed until further notice.</quote>
<quote>And whereas the disturbed condition of this country has raised the price of food and necessaries the salaries of members of the House of Commons are to be increased by &#x00A3;500 a year.</quote>
This undoubtedly would be a Money Bill, and neither the Second Chamber nor
<col>894</col>
the people would be allowed to say a word in the matter. To remonstrate would be made High Treason. Bu tit the Resolution against "tacking" as formulated by the noble Marquess became law, such a Bill would be less likely to be put forward.<lb/>
Towards the end of the Seventeenth Century some members of the House of Commons talked of sending Money Bills with Bills of Attainder tacked on to them up to the House of Lords. The history of former Single Chambers is one of bloodshed, murder, and sudden death, followed by the impoverishment of the people and the restoration of a Second Chamber. There being no legitimate means of destroying Government by a Single Chamber they have come to violent ends. We are in a state of revolution. The revolution has begun. What phases it will pass through is known to none of us. If we read the letters and diaries of people who have passed through Civil Wars and Revolutions without taking an active part, it is astounding to find how few of the writers realised the gravity of the events that they were witnessing, even though they were in the centre of the storm. When the Long Parliament and when the French States General first sat they were full of men with the best intentions, quite as good as those of the present House of Commons; they did not know where they were hurrying any more than do the members of the present Parliament. There were Girondins in the French Assembly, men who sowed the wind and reaped the whirlwind when unable to stop the movement they themselves had originated. There are Girondins on the Government side of both Houses who still have the power to stop a movement that will overwhelm them if they dally with it too long. And there are, too, in this country at the present moment Jacobins, men well known in public life, who have it in them to play the parts of Robespierre, Marat, Couthon, if they had the chance, and who if they found that they could not obtain or retain power by other means, would turn every town and village in England into a Tony-Pandy.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Northampton, in a letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> this morning, said that on the rejection of the Budget&#x2014;
<quote>"The Liberal Party then decided, and can never withdraw from that decision, that no Liberal Government would accept office unless the ultimate
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0452"/>
<col>895</col>
power of the Veto was taken from the Second Chamber. It is this that the Liberals are determined to fight for, and it makes all compromise impossible and all reforms by themselves useless."</quote>
But if Lord Rosebery's and the noble Marquess's Resolutions become law, that power will be taken from the House of Lords and will be given to the people by means of the Referendum, which, according to Lord Northampton, is exactly what the Liberal Party ask for. If these Resolutions become law there will be a People's Veto instead of a Lord's Veto. and there will be no necessity to ask for guarantees from a higher quarter. These guarantees are to be found in the Resolutions moved by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches and by the noble Marquess in front of me. Your Party has won a great victory. It has brought the members of this House into a frame of mind in which they are prepared to surrender their hereditary privileges. Pause, ere you go further&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02306"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I shall follow the advice of my noble friend below me and not make a dash into the Referendum, which the noble Lord who has just sat down explained to us much more clearly in many ways than I have ever heard it explained before. Neither do I propose to follow the noble Lord into Lough Swilly or the deeply indented coast of Ireland in a gun-boat or in any other way. What he said about our being surrounded by Jacobins and Girondins would have made me feel thoroughly uncomfortable were it not for the extremely pleasant smile with which he accompanied this disagreeable piece of news. I was very sorry that the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, towards the end of his interesting speech, when he got to closer quarters with the Resolutions before us to-night, complained of suffering from a feeling of want of reality. To my mind these Resolutions of the noble Marquess and their full discussion by this House at the present moment are as real a thing on as real an issue for us all in this country as we have had before us since the Home Rule Bill of 1892 or 1893. Whatever may be the measure of consent, or <i>quasi</i> consent, or qualified consent on the two sides of the House, I think we may all agree that we are getting on wonderfully pleasantly with this debate. It is evidently possible, as Mr. Carlyle once said, to agree very tolerably except in opinion. I do not suppose that the two sides of the House
<col>896</col>
to-night are agreed in opinion, but even if noble Lords below me are right in saying that it is quite impossible that this great Constitutional difficulty in which we now find ourselves cannot be settled by consent, it is quite clear that in this House, at all events, the matter can be argued in a cordial and generous and fair spirit. Now on Monday night I thought we were on the verge of getting a little cross. I know that I suffered myself&#x2014;and my noble friend below me, Earl Beauchamp, will perhaps corroborate it&#x2014;from two or three spasms of noble irritation. But to-night an intelligent foreigner with Virgil at his fingers' ends and with two or three selected tributes of the noble Lord, Lord Curzon. to your Lordships' House in his mind as well, could not possibly say <i>Tant&#x0153;ne animis c&#x0153;lestibus ir&#x0153;?</i> as he might have done on Monday night.<lb/>
Now I proceed to the Resolutions, and let me say at once that not only do I welcome them and thank the noble Marquess for putting them on the Paper and bringing them forward, but, speaking for myself, I am prepared to swallow them whole. That, no doubt, sounds a hardy and perhaps an indigestible proceeding, but, after all, I am taking this course on Lord Crewe's advice to us to do the same thing with the Parliament Bill, which, as Lord St. Aldwyn and Lord Weardale pointed out with great force, has not even been discussed in. the House of Commons except in a rudimentary way, and has only just flitted as it were into this House, but the clauses and Preamble of which are the Party ticket and the grounds for the General Election upon which the country is to be fought. When I say that I am prepared to swallow the Resolutions whole, I think it is also right to say that as regards the Government Bill I must admit myself to have become rather a waverer. Whatever the Conference did it gave us considerable time for reflection, and I became so convinced that we should have to find some sort of constitutional adjustment of the relations of the two Houses that, speaking for myself, I was prepared to go a very long way for the sake of a settlement by consent towards the Government Bill. But I am bound to say that, holding those views, I greatly prefer the Resolutions which the noble Marquess has put upon the Paper, and I prefer them for this reason: I feel that these Resolutions are altogether a more decorous and proper
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0453"/>
<col>897</col>
approach towards the solution of this great Constitutional question, and I prefer them very much to the Parliament Bill for the further reason that they are not stamped with the hall-mark, as that Bill is, of a particular majority in this particular Parliament and in particular relation to the Irish vote and the Irish demand.<lb/>
I feel now that I should like to put myself right with the noble Earl who sits on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery) and perhaps with the House for the line I took the other night when Lord Rosebery's Resolutions were discussed, and when he said that I had not made it clear to him what I meant. I should be sorry to think that I had in any way taken a wayward or an ungracious line that evening&#x2014;wayward in the sense of being out of harmony with the self-denying ordinance which we have all affirmed by passing these Reform Resolutions. My mind has been much concentrated upon the present difficulties in which we find ourselves, and I have felt all along that the immediate <i>crux</i> of the. situation did not lie in domestic reform from within, but in presenting to the electorate alternative proposals which would bring about a Constitutional adjustment. It seemed to me that in the very short time at our disposal, owing to what I can only call this electioneering General Election, this could only be done by giving a Second Reading to the Parliament Bill and going into Committee. But now that these Resolutions have been put forward I quite admit I was wrong. I did not know at that time that the Resolutions were coming forward, and I was nervous lest in our passion for self-reform from within we should do anything which should jeopardise our time and our chance of getting alternative proposals, by way of arriving at some agreement. by consent., put fully before the constituencies before the 28th, when the Dissolution has been fixed.<lb/>
The plan adopted by the noble Marquess the. Leader of the Opposition has been recommended by certain newspapers. The <i>Spectator</i> had, I think, two or three pages in small print of resolutions all on its own, which it strongly recommended the noble Marquess to move. For my own part I thought we should try to go into Committee on the Government
<col>898</col>
Bill because it is quite clear that Resolutions of this kind constitute an unusual expedient, and one which should only be resorted to by the noble Lord who may happen to be leading the Government at the time or the noble Lord leading the Opposition. Clearly no such Resolutions could properly have been moved or suggested by a backbencher. But if we could have got into Committee, whether or not the Government saw fit to discuss or have anything to do with Amendments, those Amendments would have been on record, and I believed the constituencies would have given our conciliatory and alternative proposals their full and fair consideration. But granting all this, I say that I think the Resolutions before us now do more even than we could have achieved in that way, and I shall therefore give them my hearty and ungrudging support. I quite recognise that it is an exceptional course. I believe the noble Marquess would be the first to say so, but it is an exceptional course which is justified by the exceptional circumstances which&#x2014;and I say it in no disagreeable way&#x2014;have been forced upon the House of Lords.<lb/>
Speaking for myself I am not, I am afraid, a very ardent reformer. I have no desire to strike any doleful note, or to sing any sort of Swan Song. I hope we are a long way off that yet. The Resolutions which were passed the other night must inevitably have very great effect. Here again I make my <i>amende</i> to the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, for if he had not gone on with them those Resolutions could not have been grafted on to the Resolutions which the noble Marquess has now moved, thus providing for a reformed Second Chamber. It is quite clear that under these Resolutions, as Lord Newton said the other night, a large number of us will have to go, and personally I shall miss a great many things which I associate with the House of Lords and of which I have become fond. I do not want to be sentimental, but I shall miss the stationery, the quill pens, and even the superlative coal fires and draughts of your Lordships' House. I have been here all my life, but whether or not it is due to some inherited aptitude, I have intuitions about the House of Commons which make me put all these personal feelings on one side and desire above all things to secure a settlement of this question. I do not know that the Resolutions can effect that, but I believe, as one or two speakers have said
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0454"/>
<col>899</col>
this evening and as even the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, said, they do provide a basis for a settlement by consent which I do not believe any Government or any constituency will altogether put aside.<lb/>
The Resolutions of the noble Marquess seem to me to have this very considerable advantage over the Parliament Bill, even the Parliament Bill taken at its very best, that they do not lay us open now, thanks, as I have just said, to Lord Rosebery for having stuck to his Resolutions&#x2014;they do not lay us open to the charge or to the actuality of a single-Chamber Government, whereas, whatever the result, may be in practice, there is no sort of doubt that the Government proposals are logically open to the charge not of adjusting Constitutional relations but of substituting till such good time as in the Government view may best suit them a single-Chamber for a double-Chamber Government. Under these circumstances the noble Marquess anti his friends will have my hearty support in these Resolutions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02307"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD or AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel certain that my noble friend and the House will forgive me if I do not attempt to follow him in discussing the reasons that prompt him to give an exceptional vote to the noble Marquess opposite in support of his Resolutions. I have been very much struck, not only in my noble friend's speech, but also in every speech that has yet been made in this debate, by the unfounded alarm and anxiety shown with regard to the policy of the Government. That disquiet was very clearly evident in the noble Marquess's outline speech this afternoon, and in the way that he discoursed so eloquently on the dangers consequent on popular election. The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, also seemed to be extraordinarily apprehensive; but the person who seemed to have the greatest amount of alarm was the most rev. Primate, who was so terrified that lie was led to make a somewhat violent attack on the Prime Minister for quoting a harmless joke of the late Dr. Johnson.<lb/>
It has been whispered that there exists in the minds of some noble Lords opposite the suspicion that the Government entertains unavowed but burglarious designs on the peace of this House, such as have
<col>900</col>
not been revealed in the language of the Bill as presented to your Lordships. If I am rightly informed in this, and if any of your Lordships suspect us of intending, if we come back to power with an ample majority, to supplement this Bill by further proposals of a penalising or vindictive nature, let me try to put your minds at rest. It is not the case. All that we ask and wish for, and even in the event of hoped-for triumph would demand, is, as Mr. Balfour said this afternoon in a great speech to his constituents the citizens of London, to tell the truth to the people of England. This alarm was. I think, also very plainly shown in the delightful speech made by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition on Monday night. I think personally, though some of it was a little at my expense, that I enjoyed that speech as much as, if not more than, any member of your Lordships' House. It was a brilliant speech. He tried, with his accustomed dexterity, to get under his opponent's guard, and it was sparkling with sentences which were most exquisitely ondul&#x00E9;s. Apart from this, allow me to say, with all respect, that I honestly thought that the matter itself was rather thin. He seemed to me, and I shall be corrected if I am wrong, to rely on the well-worn, well-known, familiar old platform argument that because the Opposition in your Lordships' House was graciously and kindly pleased to allow some Liberal measures to go through the House, therefore on that account they were justified in knocking some of our principal measures on the head, and performing that operation not only in the proper place, the public abattoir, but in private slaughter-houses&#x2014;houses of their own.<lb/>
The noble Marquess twitted me that I gave my leaders away on the occasion of a certain festive luncheon. Lord St. Aldwyn was also good enough to say that I was au innocent person. I am glad he used that epithet, and that he did not use the word "dishonest," which I very much regret was used in the speech of an antagonist who is always so courteous and so fair. I mentioned the results of five years' Liberal policy, and I said that they were satisfactory even in the difficult circumstances in which we poor humble Liberals live. I admit freely that we have had a very good harvest in our five years. We have had exceptionally fine crops, better than we should have had under ordinary
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0455"/>
<col>901</col>
circumstances; but what is the reason of that? We have lived under extraordinary circumstances, because I must remind your Lordships that we had a majority of no less than 350 votes in our favour in the Commons' House of Parliament. I do not hesitate to say that that had a certain steadying effect upon your Lordships' House. of we had had ordinary weather, if we had had an ordinary majority such as we have now, not one-fourth of the Liberal legislation which has been passed would by any possibility have found its way on to the Statute Book. Now we are going into action for the second time in twelve months. I notice that the great Party opposite, the great Unionist Party, do not seem to be quite as united as, perhaps, they would wish to have us believe. There is a certain amount of anxiety; your Lordships seem to be a little uneasy in your minds. There are two great characteristics of the great Tory Party, with all its great traditions, which strike everybody. One is the loyalty of noble Lords opposite to the Party to which you belong, and the other is a pride in the order of which so many of your Lordships are distinguished ornaments. There seems to me to be signs of a conflict between these two great principles. It is no business of mine, but on-lookers sometimes see most of the game, and I must say that your leaders are driving some of your Lordships uncommonly hard.<lb/>
What have noble Lords opposite been asked to do? You were dragged down to vote against the Budget. You did it, and you were told the reason why you were asked to do so was that the country was panting for au opportunity to turn out, to kick out, and get rid of this infamous Government. I used a moderate word; it is one that would not be called a harsh word compared with some of the expressions used against us in what is curiously called polite society. You were wrongly informed. You were beaten at the polls, and we were returned to power with a good majority, and I think every one will admit that we are considerably stronger in the country now than we were eight months ago. In seven contested elections we have not lost a single seat, and in the last election, which was supposed to be a very critical one, we kept the seat, on an old register, and we increased our majority by something like 500 votes. That hated and detested Budget is now the law of the
<col>902</col>
land, and the Second Reading of the second Budget was passed without any criticism and without a. word, in about a minute last night, in the other House. Now, you are invited, on the eve of a General Election, to agree to what Lord Curzon, I believe, called a magnificent, voluntary act of self-renunciation, but in plain English&#x2014;and the time has come at last when we must use plain English&#x2014;your Lordships have been asked, just before the General Election, to throw up the hereditary sponge. Noble Lords laugh. If your Lordships think that a laughing matter, of course I have nothing more to say, but I think independent Peers&#x2014;and I see several independent Peers present&#x2014;may fairly ask, "Is there no alternative to this? Are we going to be asked at a moment's notice to divest ourselves of our undoubted hereditary rights? Not only that, are we going to lose those rights for our sons and our sons' sons for ever?" That, in plain English, is what you are asked to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02308"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I am very sorry to interrupt the noble Earl, but is he aware of the exact date of the renunciation of the hereditary privilege by this House?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02309"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: What I say is the absolute fact. You are asked at this moment to throw up your undoubted hereditary rights, and not only your own rights but the rights of your sons and your sons' sons for ever. You may split straws, you may laugh, you may do anything you please, but you cannot get out of that. Independent Peers may ask it there are no alternatives. No alternatives? Good heavens&#x0021; Why, we have a masterly counter-stroke every two days; there is no end to the alternatives. Everybody has an alternative. The noble Marquess opposite seems not to be riding one horse, or even two, but to be trying to emulate the late Mr. Ducrow at Astley's in the difficult task of riding six horses at once. Independent members may find this confusing. Is it not worth while, in the middle of the Parliamentary chaos on the Opposition side, to ask what is in this gagged and guillotined Bill for which the Government have been asked, which they have laid upon the Table, and which has not been allowed to be discussed? Let us examine it.<lb/>
Noble Lords will discover that there are only three great principles in the Bill. The
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0456"/>
<col>903</col>
first clause says that Peers must not touch finance. Noble Lords opposite say they agree. They say, "We did it last year, and we are very sorry. We will never do it again. Once bit twice shy." Then Clause 5 says we are to have five-year Parliaments. Why not? Who objects to that? Noble Lords opposite may say, "We remember our great leader, Mr. Balfour, remained in office two years too long; he hung on like the oak leaves&#x2014;he did not know he was dead." What was the result? The most terrible collapse that the world has ever seen, and the Conservative Party received such a staggering blow that it has not recovered, and will not recover for some time to come.<lb/>
Then we come to Clause 2. Noble Lords say, "Oh, that is a terrible clause." What is in it? All that is in it is that if an ordinary Bill is sent up to this House three times in succession in two years, and your Lordships in your wisdom have rejected it, that Bill shall be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament, notwithstanding that the House of Lords has not consented to the Bill. Now what is the objection to that? What is there, after all, to object to in that? "Good Heavens," says Lord Rosebery, "why that means a Single Chamber&#x0021;" Is not the noble Earl once more rather overstating his case? Some of us have recollections of a certain speech made in a Scottish town, not a hundred miles from Edinburgh, in which we were told that the Budget was the negation of Empire, of Monarchy, of family life, and all the rest of it. Then when this Budget was brought before your Lordships' House my noble friend was the first person to come to this Table and advise your Lordships to pass it into law. May not my noble friend have overstated the case again, may he not change his mind, and may it not be perfectly on the cards that he will, after his denunciation of the Bill, advise you again in all the circumstances to pass the Bill?<lb/>
As regards the Single Chamber I will not trouble your Lordships with any words of mine. I think most of your Lordships heard the speech of the Leader of the House on Monday on the subject of a Second Chamber. In half-a-dozen sentences he knocked his noble relative's arguments straight off their legs, and with one smashing blow of the "parricidal pickaxe" he put his noble relative on his back and finished all his arguments. The time has
<col>904</col>
passed for counter-strokes and things of that description. No counter-strokes, no Conferences whatever, can bridge over the gulf that now yawns between us. The Tory House of Lords had little confidence in the Liberal House of Commons, and in return the Liberal House of Commons and the Liberal Party have now, I am afraid, very little confidence in the Tory House of Lords. This is a critical time, and the language of self-adulation will not avail us now. This Government was not chosen in any way by the people to reform the constitution of your Lordships' House at this moment; it was chosen and it was put into power under proper conditions to limit the powers of this House&#x2014;those powers which are at present absolute, omnipotent, irresponsible, and uncontrolled; and all we want, all that not only the Government but the whole of our Party want, is to restore the Constitutional balance. We ask for fair play&#x2014;that is all we ask for&#x2014;and with confidence we invite the country to approve the Parliament Bill, the object of which, stated in one sentence by my noble friend, is to prevent for ever the indiscriminate destruction of Liberal legislation by your Lordships' House, of which the throwing out of the Budget last year was the climax and the crown.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02310"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I greatly regret that it is impossible for me to sustain the discussion at that level of engaging gaiety to which the noble Earl has just lifted it. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, at an early stage of the debate, invited those who are not officially connected with either of the proposals before your Lordships' House to speak, and the fact that I felt it right both to speak and to vote against the decision to which the noble Marquess invited your Lordships in the discussion of the Finance Bill, may, perhaps, be some indication that I do not approach this question with any Party bias.<lb/>
I venture to agree with the noble Earl who has just sat clown that the rejection, or the reference to the people, of the Finance Bill by noble Lords opposite, if it did not disclose, certainly precipitated, the need for some readjustment of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament. It would have been only natural if the Government had presented before Parliament and the country the considered proposals with which they desired to meet that
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0457"/>
<col>905</col>
demand. But this is precisely what the Government have not done. The electors of this country are to be invited to approach a. General Election on a grave Constitutional question which must. affect the destinies of this country for many years to come. I venture to think that. no General Election on a question of such great importance was ever approached by the people with less information as to the real issues which are at stake. The issue is not between the will of the people and the desires of this House. It is common ground that the people are our masters as much as they are masters of the House of Commons. The issue is not between the House of Lords unreformed, unreduced in numbers, and the representatives of the people in the other House. The issue is not even whether a reformed House of Lords, a House of Lords reduced in numbers, is to retain precisely the same powers and the same procedure in relation to the other House that the present House of Lords possesses. The issue is between two methods of dealing with a situation which admittedly demands reform.<lb/>
I confess I have not noticed during this debate the traces of that "yawning gulf" of which the noble Earl has been speaking. On the contrary, what has impressed any independent observer has been the most remarkable signs of drawing together on the part of the serious and thoughtful men on both sides of the House. Therefore to present the issue as if it lay between Peers and people or between the hereditary and democratic principles is to confuse and not to present the issue to the people of this country. The people have surely a right to demand that if Parliament refers a grave question to their decision, Parliament shall have fully debated that question. The noble Earl the Leader of the House has told us that there have been ample opportunities of discussing this question; that there might have been serious Amendments moved to the Bill which he introduced into the House. I do not dwell upon the point&#x2014;it has been repeatedly mentioned already&#x2014;that the noble Earl himself informed us that if we did bring forward these serious Amendments they would receive very scant consideration at his hands. I would rather dwell on the fact that the Bill itself has never been seriously debated even in the House of Commons. Certainly the Resolutions and the whole scheme of Parliamentary reform which they embody, presented by the noble Marquess, have never even been
<col>906</col>
laid before the House of Commons, and this Parliamentary discussion would have been perfectly feasible if the ordinary procedure of Parliament had been observed and the questions as a whole had been discussed in both Houses of Parliament. With the utmost possible deference and diffidence, I think that even the Resolutions proposed by the noble Marquess might he amended or reconsidered in certain particulars with fuller discussion, but the difficulty is that all chance of giving them full and adequate discussion has been denied to both Houses of Parliament by the decision of His Majesty's Government to dissolve.<lb/>
The noble Earl also said that there would be ample discussion of the matter all over the country, but the important question is, Upon what grounds is that discussion to be conducted? Is it to be conducted upon the grounds which have been debated to-day in this House&#x2014;serious grounds&#x2014;or is it to be debated by appeals to the least rational forms of class prejudice with which in certain very responsible quarters this great Constitutional debate has already been inaugurated? The noble Earl also declared that the adequate discussion of the Resolutions of the noble Marquess would take at least twelve months. That, I think, would be a valid criticism if there were any reason to suppose that these Resolutions did not represent a genuine desire on the part of the majority of this House to reform its constitution, its procedure, and its relation to the House of Commons.<lb/>
As one who has no kind of opportunity of knowing the motives that led the noble Marquess to introduce these Resolutions I have been impressed&#x2014;and I do not think any one who heard his speech or that of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, could have failed to have been impressed&#x2014;with the obvious genuineness with which the noble Marquess and Lord St. Aldwyn spoke in submitting these considered proposals to the judgment of Parliament. If so I think the matters to which these Resolutions call attention&#x2014;proposals for settling differences by joint sittings, proposals about a Referendum&#x2014;whatever criticisms may be advanced against them, are certainly quite worth twelve months discussion, and equally certainly, perhaps more certainly, the election which took place at the end of such a serious discussion would be an election serious and deliberate,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0458"/>
<col>907</col>
and the results would have sonic chance of being stable and permanent. I am bound to admit that the noble Earl who has just spoken has some reason to complain of the grievance of the Party to which he belongs in the treatment which their legislation has sometimes received at the hands of this House. But, my Lords, assuming that his grievance is legitimate, it would be an excellent reason for presenting grave proposals before Parliament to remove that grievance; not for forcing an election upon the country without adequate discussion in Parliament on the points upon which it is to be conducted.<lb/>
The Prime Minister has said in vivid language that negotiations have ended, and that war is declared. I presume, my Lords, that the first statement means that the Conference is regarded as having failed and that the situation is precisely where it was before the Conference began. But I ask myself, Is the situation precisely where it was? And the answer to that question is found in the Resolutions which the noble Marquess has presented. I venture to think that but for that period of pause, possibly but for those interchanges of ideas which took place within closed doors, these Resolutions might not have been placed on the Table of this House. At any rate, they present a new situation which certainly Parliament ought to have new opportunities for facing and discussing. War, I suppose, is an appeal to force when reason has failed. If it be true, as I have ventured to contend, that reason has not wholly failed, it is a very grave responsibility to produce the conditions of war before, at least, reason has had time to make its appeal to public opinion outside these doors.<lb/>
It is a poor compliment to the people of this country to treat a General Election as if it were a mere arbitrament of force. Trust in the people ought to mean trust in the judgment of the people, and the best way of showing that trust is to secure that the judgment of the people is fully informed and therefore intelligent. I cannot but regret deeply that the Government have chosen to thrust this question in an unconsidered form before the people of this country. I have no means of appreciating the reasons which have led to this course, but as an independent citizen I cannot but be disappointed, and I am sure I am speaking for many not prominently
<col>908</col>
connected with either Party- outside&#x2014;I cannot but be deeply disappointed that a great issue, one of the greatest ever submitted within recent memory to the decision of the people of the country, should have been presented to them with a haste which makes their judgment necessarily crude, and the verdict. which they return almost necessarily unstable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02311"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I came down to the House this afternoon with the intention not so much of taking an active part in the debate as of asking the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition to remove from my mind, and from the minds of some noble Lords whom I have consulted, an obscurity which seems to us to attach to that portion of the second Resolution which deals with the question of proportion. But the noble Marquess in the course of his speech said that this question could not be settled until they knew how this House was to be composed under the operation of the Resolutions proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery. That statement made me doubt whether I ought to proceed with my intention. But the point will probably be met by what fell from the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. The noble Viscount said that under the operation of these Resolutions this House is not to be placed on an equality with the House of Commons, that the House of Commons is to be predominant&#x2014;and in support of that statement lie quoted some words of Mr. Balfour to the same effect. Now from the noble Viscount's statement my inference is&#x2014;and I would ask the noble Marquess to say whether it is correct or not&#x2014;that in the Joint Session for which the second Resolution provides the delegates from the House of Commons chosen to represent the view of the majority in that House will be in a majority over the delegates chosen to represent the view of this House.

who leads this House, no objection on the part of the Government. It declares that it is desirable that provision should be made for settling differences which may arise between the House of Commons and this House. The practice formerly was, as we have been told in the course of the debate, for conferences on points of dispute and difficulty to be held, but that lately they have fallen into abeyance. As far as I can remember there was general agreement on all sides of the house when the noble Earl who leads the House stated that that was a matter to which His Majesty's Government would give very favourable consideration. The second Resolution on the Paper provides that if a difference arises between the two Houses which cannot be settled there shall be a joint sitting. If I am correct in assuming that at that joint sitting the views of the Lower House, the predominant partner, shall predominate, I, for my part, cannot see what objection there can be to such an arrangement as that; but when you come later and say that certain subjects are excluded from consideration and made subject to a Referendum, then I think that very serious considerations arise.<lb/>
What is meant by a Referendum? Are all subjects to be made the basis of a Referendum? Previous to a Referendum, is there to be no consultation between Members of Parliament and their constituents? I believe the Referendum is mostly practised in Switzerland, and there, so far as I can understand, it is an extremely conservative measure. The appeal is made not so mulch to the intelligence of the constituents as to their unwillingness to adopt any measure which conflicts with the existing state of things. In many instances it has happened that where the consent of both sides of Parliament has been obtained to a measure admittedly beneficial and then put to the Referendum, the effect has been a conflict with the decision which had been arrived at by the representatives. If you regard in a democracy the more ignorant and the more stolid portion of the population, the Referendum may be an instrument for the prevention of all progress. if, on the other hand, you regard in a democracy the more educated and more progressive part of the community, then the Referendum is out of place as conflicting with the system of representative government which is in force in this country. I think the
<col>910</col>
noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, said that Tariff Reform might be made the subject of a Referendum, and he instanced the ease where the question of Colonial Preference might be put to the voters. On such a matter as that I wonder what percentage of a rural constituency would be able to give any considered judgment. But if, instead of this question, you asked whether taxation of food or of raw material was to their liking, the only answer you would get would probably be in the negative.<lb/>
As to the last Resolution with reference to Money Bills, I think that the matter is one which is very susceptible of adjustment and that the proposal in the Resolution of the noble Marquess offers a reasonable basis for discussion, and I myself would have no objection to its being tried. It has been stated more than once in the course of the debate that your Lordships have not had sufficient time to consider and to discuss this question. It is true that the matter has not been placed before you in the form of a Bill for many clays, but the Bill is nothing more in substance than the Resolutions which were passed by the House of Commons a long time ago, and which were laid upon the Table of your Lordships' House. Your Lordships have been seized of the fact that these proposals had been placed before you by the Government, and that later on they would be followed by a Bill, so that the objection that your Lordships have had no time for full consideration is hardly one which would be generally endorsed.<lb/>
It has been stated that the real reason why these proposals are being pushed forward&#x2014;it was stated by Lord Ellenborough&#x2014;was that Home Rule might be passed without due deliberation and the safety of the Empire endangered. My Lords, I have for a long time been in favour of a measure of extended local government for Ireland&#x2014;call it I-Ionic Rule, or Devolution, or by whatever name you please&#x2014;but in the scheme which those with whom I am collaborating endeavour to express their views there is nothing more definite or more insisted upon than the integrity and the safety of the United Kingdom. The points brought forward as to the danger to our Navy or our Army or the safety of our Empire by giving to Ireland the power of making its own laws for purely domestic /natters is surely a very far-fetched idea. The Navy and the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0460"/>
<col>911</col>
Army and Imperial matters will remain as they are now. The only thing that will be effected be that the Imperial Parliament will be relieved of much of the work which oppresses it now. Larger questions will be discussed more fully and with wider knowledge, and small matters of local importance in Ireland, and, it may be, in Scotland and Wales if a similar devolution of power is extended to those countries, will be dealt with by the fuller knowledge which local persons can command. My Lords, I deprecate introducing into this question such a matter as Home Rule. That matter can be discussed on its merits when it arises; but it surely should not be taken as a factor in the discussion of Resolutions like these, or in the consideration of the Bill now before your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02314"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl the Leader of the House invited the back-benchers to take part in this debate, and it is to that invitation that I desire to respond. I rather think he had the idea that his invitation would lead to an expression of dissent from the policy of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition from these Benches, but instead of that having been the case his invitation has recoiled on his own head, and he has met only with opposition from the ranks of his own followers. I should like to say at once that I give my most cordial support, for what it is worth, to the noble Marquess. I am with him heart and soul in his proposals. And I am no new convert to the principle which underlies them. I have long been in favour of a reform of the House of Lords, and I have for many years, both publicly and privately, fully admitted the grievance which is felt by members of the Radical Party at the disparity between the Parties in this House.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Leader of the House complained&#x2014;perhaps I ought not to say complained, because he made the remark in his kindest manner&#x2014;the noble Earl said that I very often put interesting questions to him. If he were here, I should like to say that that is scarcely avoidable. The noble Earl takes upon himself, indeed he is obliged to take upon himself, in an unexampled manner, the whole burden of the work of the Front Bench in this House, and lie does so with a courage and a spirit which we all admire. Well, my Lords, I am afraid I shall have to suggest some other questions to him. I suppose I ought to reply to the last speaker from the Front
<col>912</col>
Bench, the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, but as I am not so well acquainted as he is with the French language, nor vet so versed in agriculture, I am afraid I cannot attempt to reply to his exquisite <i>onodul&#x00E9;</i> oration, nor am I prepared to follow the noble Lord who spoke last on the subject of Home Rule.<lb/>
First of all I wish to offer an answer to the noble Earl the Leader of the House on a point which I think has thus far escaped attention. The noble Earl doubted the existence of a Constitutional right on the part of this House to amend Money Bills. I thought we had clone with all that in the lengthy discussions which took place on the Finance Bill eighteen months ago. I believe that the position is this. The House of Lords has never formally acquiesced in the claim of the House of Commons that Money Bills should not be amended in this House. The House of Commons, of course, have passed Resolutions denying the right of amendment, but those Resolutions are not binding on your Lordships' House. The fact is that the right has fallen into desuetude, but that does not mean that it does not exist. Take a simple illustration. A man has, I believe, a right at law to use a revolver in his defence if attacked in his own house by a burglar, but if he is fortunate enough never to be so attacked, he does not forfeit his right to protect his own life in that manner. Before the great controversy over the Paper Duties in 1860, the right to amend Bills was exercised on a great many occasions. The facts and the circumstances were public property and were constantly discussed and debated at the time of the discussions on the Finance Bill, but I have not had an opportunity this evening of looking up any actual cases.<lb/>
I do not think that the noble Earl the Leader of the House could have been quite serious when lie described the procedure which has been adopted by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, as arbitrary and complicated. I prefer to think that he was doing a bit of electioneering, and, to use a common phrase, was "tipping a wink" to his followers on the platforms all over the country. I regretted, as most of us must have regretted, his use of the expression "want of candour." It was unlike the noble Earl. The noble Earl went on to say that two other courses would have been preferable, but he omitted to say that lie meant it would have
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0461"/>
<col>913</col>
been preferable to the Government and to the. Radical Party. The first suggestion was that your Lordships might have amended the Bill in Committee. Why, the noble Earl told us in so many words that no Amendment would be admitted; and I think it must have struck many of your Lordships that no Leader of this House has ever been before in so humiliating a position as was the noble Earl when forced by his sense of Party allegiance to come clown and convey to this House a message so insulting and so outrageous. It would no doubt have been convenient to the Radical Party had they been able to say that the House of Lords in amending the Veto Bill had again adopted an attitude of defiance to the popular will and. had again mutilated a Radical measure. But I ask, as a matter of common sense, would those Amendments have been as convenient a method as the noble Marquess's Resolutions of explaining to the people what is the alternative policy offered by the Unionist Party? No doubt, it would leave been more convenient to the followers of the Government, but the alternative policy would not have been presented in so clear, or concise, or in so compact a form, and would have been capable of unlimited misrepresentation.<lb/>
The other suggestion was that we should throw out the Veto Bill, and I do not doubt for a moment that that is what would have pleased the noble Earl and his friends best of all. It would certainly have been a most suitable course for Radical electioneering purposes, and we must forgive the noble Earl his disappointment that this course was not adopted. I think that most sensible people throughout the country will regard the method that has been followed by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition as the most candid, the most convenient, and the most convincing method of explaining to the people of this country that there is a possible alternative to the Bill of the Government. In this connection I would ask your Lordships whether it is usual or in accordance with precedent&#x2014;the noble Earl is an upholder of precedent&#x2014;for Parliament to chuck Bills at the heads of the electorate with the remark that they need not be discussed in Parliament as they can be discussed for weeks in the country? As if you could discuss a Bill on a platform&#x0021; On a platform there are generally only one or two speakers, and any attempt at discussion is invariably ruled out.<lb/>
<col>914</col>
I pass on to several criticisms which were made by the noble Earl in regard to these Resolutions, and in connection with which I should like to suggest some questions for his consideration. On the point of Joint Sessions he said that it would be necessary to hire a ball the size of Olympia. Surely that was rather en unnecessary exaggeration. Even if both Houses sat together the total number would not exceed 1,300, and those who have any experience of public meetings know that a comparatively small building will accommodate that number. But I do not suppose that it entered the mind of anybody who has been seriously entertaining this proposal that the whole of both Houses should sit together. The suggestion is, of course, that there should be delegations, and I presume that it would be possible, when it conies to the discussion of details, that those delegations should be chosen by some sort of proportionate representation which would be fair to all Parties concerned. But what was the noble Earl's objection. He said that the members of the House of Commons are all equal, that they ought, therefore, all to have an equal voice. The question I should like to ask him is this: Do the members of the House of Commons have an equal voice now? Does he and do his friends in the Cabinet give them an equal voice? Have they had an equal voice in regard to the framing of this Veto Bill and the policy under which it is being disposed of? My Lords, the decision was that of the Cabinet oligarchy alone, and the members of the House of Commons had nothing like an equal voice in the settlement of that policy. It follows, therefore, that that argument will hardly hold water.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl passed to the question of the Referendum, and said there was no precedent for it on so gigantic a scale. The noble Earl surely has no need to worry about precedents. For something like 700 years this country has been ruled by King, Lords, and Commons, and it has been understood during all that period that all laws must be made with the assent of all three. But now under the Veto Bill it is proposed that there should be two sorts of laws&#x2014;the laws which are made by King and Commons alone, and the laws which are made. by King, Lords, and Commons. That is surely a considerable departure from precedent so far as this country is concerned. And so far as I am aware,
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0462"/>
<col>915</col>
there is no precedent for such a distinction between one class of laws and another class of laws in any civilised country in the world. It opens up immense possibility of difficulties which it is only necessary to suggest in order to show how very grave the problem of dealing with them would be. How would the Courts of Law in this country treat these different kinds of laws? Is it not likely that they might not treat one class with the same respect as the other class of laws? Then, again, I should like to ask what precedent is there, either in this or any other country, for the position which it is proposed to assign to the Speaker under the Veto Bill? Again, what precedent is there for the proposal to establish the infallibility of the House of Commons? The principle of the Veto Bill is that whatever the House of Commons says three times is right, and, if I remember rightly, it was wittily remarked by a member of the other House that the only precedent for such an idea was to be found in the Snark, who said, "Whatever I say three times is right."<lb/>
We are told that the object of this Veto Bill is delay and revision. That is a very extraordinary claim, seeing that the Bill in very specific terms precludes revision. It invites the House of Commons to send up a Bill again and again without revision, for if a Bill is revised in any essential particular it ceases to remain the same Bill. But the most singular argument of all to my mind was that you could not put a tariff into a Referendum. Who on earth would dream of doing so in the sense suggested by the noble Earl? Supposing there was a difference between the two Houses on the subject of a tariff, I cannot see any impossibility about referring the general question of principle, whether you will have a tariff or not, or whether you will have this or that tariff; but nobody would dream of asking the electorate to discuss every detail of such a tariff any more than we asked the nation to discuss every detail of the Budget. The noble Earl quoted the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition when he said that Bills for social and political objects were those which ought to be submitted to the people. Why, then, I would ask, did the noble Earl object to the Budget being so submitted? It was not submitted for the discussion of detail, as he seemed to think a tariff would have to be submitted, but for the verdict of the people on the general principle. The question submitted to the people was, Do
<col>916</col>
you or do you not wish to have a Budget which for the first time introduces Socialistic principles; do you or do you not wish that your Finance Bill for the year should be used as a "flexible instrument" for solving Constitutional problems&#x2014;in other words, for introducing revolution. You say that this Veto Bill submits questions for the judgment of the people. The people do not come in at all in the Veto Bill, and it is on that ground that I think the Veto Bill is essentially an undemocratic measure. That, however, is not surprising, for the Radical Party seem nowadays to entirely ignore the sovereignty of the people. They forget them so far that they claim that the Radical Party ought to have their way; they do not often say it is the people who ought to have their way. But, as we have already been reminded in this debate, it is the people who are the masters, not only of the House of Commons, but also of this House. Therefore I agree entirely with my noble friend Lord Weardale when he said that the wisest and the easiest and the most democratic course is to refer questions at issue between the two Houses for the decision of the people. That is what this House is for. That is what this House has always done, and what this House will continue to do so long as it is preserved from the parricidal pickaxe&#x2014;or shall I say the regicidal pickaxe&#x2014;of the Radical Party.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02325"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need not detain the House at any great length over the Finance Bill, but it is desirable that I should say a few words to explain to your Lordships the form in which this year it comes before the House. The Bill deals only with certain provisions for the finance of the year it deals with the Tea Duty, with the Income Tax, and with provision for the Sinking Fund, and it also contains clauses dealing with some smaller matters relating to finance&#x2014;clauses which are of the nature of concessions, mostly of a technical character, in relation to other taxes and licences. It covers all the ground which is not covered by those taxes which are permanent, and which until they are repealed by Act of Parliament form part of the law of the land.<lb/>
Your Lordships will note, therefore, that the course which we are adopting on this occasion differs in material respects from that which was recommended to us by the noble Marquess who is not in his place, the Leader of the Opposition, at the time when the Finance Bill of the previous year was before the House, just a year ago. At that time we were asked to pass an Act of Parliament legalising certain taxes, but
<col>918</col>
leaving all the rest of the financial provision of the year uncertain and undecided. That, of course, is not what we are doing now, because this proposed plan, as I say, if and when your Lordships are good enough to pass the Bill, will complete, so far as the raising of taxes is concerned, the entire financial provision of the year, so that the Budget itself is not split in the manner in which ii was proposed that it should be split a year ago, although the debate on the Budget is undoubtedly split, and this fact has been a matter of comment in another place and may possibly be made a matter of comment here.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I. think you will agree that the particular point of dividing the debate upon the Budget, although not the Budget itself, into two is one which concerns us here very much less than it concerns the other House. The arrangement made is so far as those taxes are concerned which form part of the permanent provision for raising money, that the debate upon them in another place and the possible moving of Amendments should be postponed until after the meeting of the new Parliament. That course, whatever objection it may be thought necessary to take to it, does not materially concern us here, because it is always open at any time of any session for any of your Lordships to draw attention, either by Question or by Motion, to any subject connected with the finance of the year which you may think worthy of comment. It has not been the custom, and we in this House say it has never been the right, of your Lordships to amend the Budget or to suggest Amendments to the Budget, and consequently I think I am not overstating the case when I say that the postponement of the power of criticism and of amendment so far as regards such subjects as the Licence Duty, the Land Taxes, and others, although it may affect the cow se of debate in another place, does not place us here under any disability of any kind.<lb/>
The justification for the course which we are taking this year depends and must depend, upon the opinion we hold as to the necessity for a Dissolution of Parliament at this particular moment. On that point I know very well we are not agreed. Your Lordships opposite hold as I understand, that no Dissolution of Parliament was necessary in the immediate future. Therein you differ categorically from the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0464"/>
<col>919</col>
Leader of your Party, Mr. Balfour, who, although he maintained that it was not necessary that His Majesty should be asked to dissolve Parliament now, stated his opinion that a Dissolution of Parliament was inevitable within a few weeks or months; and if that was so, and taking it for the moment as an agreed proposition, we are prepared to maintain, assuming it to be the case that a Dissolution could not be long deferred, that in asking His Majesty to dissolve Parliament now rather than in January or in the early spring we have taken a course which is the most convenient for the country. We are told that the course we have taken is one which is disastrous owing to the disturbance of Christmas trade and the upsetting of the ordinary course of events at this season which is approaching one ordinarily given up to holiday. But I venture to say that if it had been known that a Dissolution was certain although somewhat slightly deferred, that disturbance, unfortunate as we all agree that it is, would have been greatly increased. All the objections which can be taken now to a Dissolution and to an election&#x2014;which I may remind your Lordships will be over so far as ninny parts of the country are concerned by the end of the first week in December, and practically in all parts of the country by the end of the second week&#x2014;and all disturbance caused thereby would have been vastly increased by the knowledge that an election was soon impending and by the state of agitation and commotion which would necessarily have accompanied that knowledge. I believe, therefore, that in advising the Crown as we have, we have, assuming, of course, that a Dissolution was necessary at all, adopted the most convenient course. I ask your Lordships to read the Bill a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02327"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to make a speech on the somewhat extraordinary apology which the noble Earl has just addressed to the House for the unprecedented course which has been taken in regard to this Bill. Your Lordships will have in recollection all that was said last year as to the effect on the finance of the country of the delay of the then Budget even for the purpose of submission to the constituencies. What has been the
<col>920</col>
course since the return of the present Parliament? There was at first a marked indisposition on the part of the Government to submit the Budget on which they had gone to the country to the verdict of the House of Commons. That was overcome after months of what appeared to us unreasonable delay. The new Budget was consequently put off to a period of the year for which no precedent existed, and. as time went on every obstacle was again interposed in the House of Commons to the discussion of that Budget and to bringing to solution questions which it was well known would be very dangerous to the followers of the Government. An adjournment was made to the autumn, and then when the time came to make good all this provision a portion only is dealt with. An attempt was made to divide the Budget, leaving out those portions on which there was controversy in the present House of Commons and dealing only with those on which there was more or less agreement in the Party which supports His Majesty's Government. Your Lordships do not intend to vote on this question, and therefore I forbear from making any observations, except merely to enter our protest against the treatment to which we have been subjected in this matter in not being allowed to discuss, as we have a right to do, the finance of the country as a whole&#x2014;treatment which has never before been meted out to Parliament, and which has obviously been dictated by a desire on the part of His Majesty's Government to avoid troublesome questions. Having entered this protest against the course which the Government have taken, we do not propose to trouble your Lordships further with regard to it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MINERAL ROYALTIES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02330"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether Mineral Rights Duty is properly assessed and levied upon the gross amount of rent or royalties paid in respect of the right to work minerals without any deduction for necessary expenditure by the proprietor for computing and checking the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0465"/>
<col>921</col>
amount of rent due in relation to the minerals worked; whether for the purposes of Super-Tax and Income Tax the like gross return is the proper basis of assessment; and, if so, whether it is the fact that in assessment of Income Tax a deduction is made in respect of the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance, and management of land or houses; and further, whether in assessing the rateable value of property deduction is made in respect of the cost of repairs and insurance; and whether His Majesty's Government will explain why in the case of mineral rights taxation is levied upon the gross return both for Mineral Rights Duty, Super-Tax, and Income Tax; and whether it is their intention to provide for the allowance of a reasonable deduction from the gross return.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02331">The noble Lord said: My Lords, were this not the last day of the session I should have again postponed the Question which stands in my name, as I did last week, in order to enable your Lordships at once to proceed with the consideration of the Resolutions proposed by the noble Marquess. As it is I propose to be as brief as possible in putting the Question. The object of it is to ask His Majesty's Government whether Income Tax, Super-Tax, and Mineral Rights Duty, amounting in all to 2s. 8d. in the &#x00A3;, are rightly assessed and collected on the gross income received by a mine-owner. Your Lordships are aware that this is not the case with regard to land or buildings. Up till last year an abatement of one-eighth and one-sixth respectively was given in regard to these, and last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer increased that abatement if the land-owner could show that more was spent on his property. Those of your Lordships who have mineral property are aware that there are also heavy charges in connection with it, and that the gross income does not go into the pocket of the mine-owner. It is as necessary to have a mining agent for mineral property as it is to have a land agent in respect of land. Most leases with which I am acquainted contain a special provision that the owner may have checking clerks at each pit mouth, and. if he exercises this right it is, of course, a further charge upon him. In addition, the legal expenses in connection with mineral property are very great. There is constant friction between mineral and agricultural tenants, the settling of which, of course, involves expenditure. I may mention the case of a colliery
<col>922</col>
company that went bankrupt. There was a. provision in the lease by which the partners in the colliery were responsible for the rent, and though the mineral owner was able eventually to recover it, it was only after incurring very heavy legal expenses&#x2014;twenty per cent. of the amount due&#x2014;and the Receiver in Bankruptcy before paying it to him deducted the whole amount due for Income Tax on the gross amount. The tax on minerals is really a tax upon capital. I hope His Majesty's Government will be able to offer an assurance that if they are returned to office they will do something to remedy what I think I have substantiated is a real grievance. I hope we shall not hear that they cannot give any decision at present. They have been able to give-assurances as to what they will do in future with regard to your Lordships'. House, the Osborne Judgment, Women's. Suffrage, and payment of members, and I hope they will also acknowledge that this is a grievance which calls for redress.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02332"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the important debate which awaits us, I trust I may be permitted to follow the example of my noble friend and be very brief in my reply. I think it will simplify matters if I divide the noble Lord's Questions into different parts. The answer to the first two Questions is in the affirmative. As to the third Question, whether-it is the fact that in assessment of Income Tax a deduction is made in respect of the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance, and management of land or houses, the answer is also in the affirmative; but I must guard myself by saying that it is within the limits of Section 35 of the Finance Act, 1894, and Section 69 of the Finance Act, 1909&#x2013;10. Next the noble Lord asks whether, in assessing the rateable value of property, deduction is made in respect of the cost of repairs and insurance. That is a matter which concerns the local authorities, and which I will not go into further at present.<lb/>
The next Question&#x2014;whether His Majesty's Government will explain why in the case of mineral rights taxation is levied upon the gross return for Mineral Rights Duty, Super-Tax, and Income Tax &#x2014;brings me, I think, to the point of my noble friend's argument. It is this. That we allow deductions to be made for maintenance, repairs, insurance and other matters with regard to land, but do not do
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0466"/>
<col>923</col>
so in the case of mining royalties. I put it to the House that the two things are not exactly on all fours, for the taxes in the two cases are collected in entirely different ways, and, as a rule, the proportion of cost in the case of mining royalties is not nearly so great as in the case of the management of estates and in the case of land generally. What the noble Lord is endeavouring to do is to take advantage of the concessions which the Government made in the Finance Act of last year. Your Lordships will, perhaps, recall the generosity&#x2014;I must say, taking Chancellors of the Exchequer as a class, the really extraordinary generosity&#x2014;shown by my right hon. friend the present Chancellor of the Exchequer to agricultural landlords in the Budget of last year. Your Lordships will recollect that he gave an abatement of one-eighth of the total duty in the case of land, and one-twelfth in the case of house property for the cost of maintenance, repairs, and similar matters. Now my noble friend on the Cross Benches endeavours to take advantage of the well-known generosity of my right hon. friend Mr. Lloyd George. Noble Lords laugh, but I do not think any Tory Government has ever given such a rebate to agricultural landlords as was given by my right hon. friend. The noble Lord now asks that it should also be given in the case of mining royalties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02333"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: I did not ask only for that. I asked also why the abatement which is given in respect of land under the Act of 1894 should not also be given in respect of minerals. That is not asking for generosity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02334"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend is asking for more than I first understood him to ask for. My answer must be that it is necessary for the present Government, and, indeed, for any Government, to draw the line somewhere. The two cases are not, in our opinion, of exactly the same nature, and my answer, therefore, to the question whether it is our intention to provide for the allowance of a deduction from the gross return is also in the negative. I am bound to add, though it may be cold comfort to my noble friend, that supposing in the dim and distant future noble Lords opposite cross the floor of the House and occupy the benches which we now adorn, it is very unlikely that the noble Lord will obtain the deduction for which he now asks.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02338">That in the opinion of this House it is desirable that provision should be made for settling differences which may arise between the House of Commons and this House, reconstituted and reduced in numbers in accordance with the recent Resolutions of this House.</p>

to the Joint Sitting, but shall be submitted for decision to the electors by Referendum.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02342">That as to Money Bills, such provision should be upon the following lines&#x2014;</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02346">If the Committee hold that the Bill or provisions in question are not purely financial in character, they shall be dealt with forthwith in a Joint Sitting of the two Houses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02347"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was naturally to be expected that this debate should travel a good deal beyond the text of the Resolutions standing in the name of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, for we stand undoubtedly in a very grave Constitutional crisis, and its gravity is admitted on all sides. I feel that I ought to address your Lordships on this subject relating, as it does to the Constitutional usage and the Constitutional position of this House.<lb/>
There are really two questions which have been debated so far, and they will be, I suppose, debated to-day. The first is, "Why have the Government recommended and advised a Dissolution of Parliament?" It is undoubtedly a very serious neglect of duty to advise a Dissolution without adequate grounds. The second question is, "What would be the effect of the Resolutions placed on the Paper by the noble Marquess?" I wish to discuss these subjects as simply and as concisely as I can, and to follow the example of those who have preceded me in the debate in avoiding both rhetoric and recrimination.<lb/>
I come therefore to the first question as to why we have advised the Crown to dissolve Parliament. I will give my own reasons which I have no doubt are also the
<col>926</col>
reasons that animated my colleagues. I think that Lord St. Aldwyn said our case was a dishonest case. I suppose lie must have meant the phrase in a Parliamentary sense, but he grounded that censure upon the supposition that we are advising a Dissolution of Parliament as an indirect method of obtaining Home Rule for Ireland, which he thought we did not dare to ask the constituencies directly to grant. It is not so.<lb/>
It is perfectly true, as I have said here before and elsewhere, that I hope most heartily the outcome of any General Election may be Home Rule for Ireland. I have been devoted to that cause for twenty-five years, and I am devoted to it still. I will not enter into the merits of a question which would be foreign to the present discussion; but may I ask your Lordships who are opposed to this view to take two things into consideration. Have your Lordships, especially those of you who have been members of the House of Commons, ever considered what is the present state of public business in the House of Commons, and what it has been for the last fifteen or twenty years. It would be a very serious thing for this country, whatever view you may take of the predominance of this House or of its relations to the other House, if the House of Commons, which is the primary representative Assembly, were to lose in reputation or in usefulness, and be unable to discharge its necessary duties to the country. It would be still more serious if as a result of the time and labour, useless, fruitless, and disappointing, that is exacted from members of the House, the class of men who enter it were lower than they are now.<lb/>
There is one other point of view which I may be allowed to present. It is this. Do your Lordships consider at any time how desirable it would be for us all, if we could agree about it, to settle this Irish question in view of Imperial interests? I think it is true that we shall never get a complete accord such as we should desire with the United States of America unless we can get rid of this Irish difficulty, which has been a reproach to this country for a long time. I think it is also true that we shall never have that completely harmonious friendship with our great self-governing Colonies, or fellow States, if I may so call them, where
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0468"/>
<col>927</col>
there are a very large number of men of Irish blood devoted to their country, unless we can find some such solution of that problem as has been recommended by the Parliament of Canada and by the Parliament of Australia. I pass from that subject, only saying that quite recently there has been a very remarkable movement in the Conservative Press and also among leading Conservatives, somewhat younger in age and therefore with more hope of the future, for an advance in that direction. But, my Lords, it is not for the sake of Home Rule that we have advised the Dissolution of Parliament.<lb/>
Our reason has been that it is necessary in our opinion to bring to an issue at once irreconcilable divergences of principle as to the redress of admitted grievances arising from the relations between the two Houses of Parliament. We have learned by experience that it is impossible for a Liberal Government to maintain office with self-respect or with usefulness to the country unless some remedy can be provided for the grievance which is now admitted. We have also learned that it is impossible to reach any agreement as to the remedies which we could honestly recommend to our friends and supporters in the country.<lb/>
Let me briefly recapitulate our experiences which have led us to that conclusion. Prior to 1905 the Conservative Government was in almost uninterrupted power for twenty years. Then we came in and found heavy arrears awaiting us, and we set to work, supported by an unprecedented majority in the House of Commons. My Lords, there were many difficulties. One was the education difficulty. That also contains an admitted grievance. It has not been disputed that there is a legitimate grievance with regard to the education system. We brought in a Bill in 1906. We found ourselves powerless to carry it through this House. We tried again and yet again by making concessions, and we found that we then could not pass our altered proposals through the House of Commons itself because the concessions would not be accepted by either Party. Then comes the Scottish Land Bill&#x2014;a Bill in my humble opinion necessary for the purpose of ending, or helping to end, a state of things which leads to emigration and depopulation in the country districts of Scotland. I
<col>928</col>
introduced that Bill into this House myself, and I offered on the Second Reading to accept any reasonable Amendments. I stated, what was the fact, that I was authorised to make all reasonable concession to meet opposition. Your Lordships would not even give it a Second Reading. The next Bill was the Licensing Bill, dealing with the subject which is at the very root of all social reform, and without which no social reform can be effectively entertained. That was refused a Second Reading. Finally, the Budget was thrown out in 1909. I do not speak of minor Bills.<lb/>
We had then to consider our position as a Cabinet. For 100 years, my Lords, I believe I am right, this House has never thrown out a single Bill introduced by a Conservative Government. I will not say that I have gone through the pages of <i>Hansard</i>, but I have a pretty fairly accurate political knowledge, and if any of your Lordships can suggest a single Bill introduced by a Conservative Government which during 100 years has been thrown out by this House I shall admit his authority, but I do not think that one can be suggested. That being the position, we found that in four years four great Bills of ours had been thrown out in succession, and the last of them was, as we thought, a Bill the rejection of which was contrary to all Constitutional usage. We were finally driven to a General Election by what we regarded as a flagrant invasion of Constitutional right, and then we resolved, and publicly stated our resolution, that we would and must postpone all other business excepting necessary or uncontroversial business and retain office only for the purpose and on the condition that we could settle this business of the relatior between the two Houses. We obtained large majority on that subject. We have devoted the time of the House of Commons this year, except so far as it has been taken up by the Budget, practically to the Veto Resolutions. The Parliament Bill which is before your Lordships is merely the echo of those Resolutions. Their principle has been before the country since the year 1906 and was fully ratified at the last General Election. Now, my Lords, how was that received, notwithstanding the last General Election, in the House of Commons by the leader of the Conservative Party? Mr. Balfour said with regard to the first financial Resolution that it was a perfectly ludicrous
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0469"/>
<col>929</col>
and absurd suggestion. He said with regard to the Resolution relating to general legislation&#x2014;
<quote>"I say it is the most absurd and unconstitutional method of dealing with a great constitutional case that eau possibly be conceived."</quote>
It was very obvious that our proposals had no chance of being accepted by the Opposition in the House of Commons, and I think that your Lordships in candour will admit that they had very few chances of being accepted by this House of Parliament either.<lb/>
Then came the great tragedy of the death of the late, King. There was a chance of peace. No one in the country more welcomed it than His Majesty's Government, and no member of His Majesty's Government more heartily welcomed the prospect, if it was possible, than myself. We proposed a Conference which was accepted. Eight picked men, representing both sides of politics, met. They were all, I believe, every one of them anxious to reach a settlement of this business if they could. After twenty-one meetings lasting over four months they were obliged to announce the failure of their negotiations, and we had to abandon that Conference as without hope of fruit. The Government had again to consider their position. What were we to do? Were we to lay aside our policy of adjusting the relations between the two Houses and to proceed with other regular and ordinary legislative business? No one has ever suggested that, and had we even been allowed to do it it would have been a dishonourable thing to think of doing when you consider the issue there was before the country at the last General Election, and the promises and pledges that all Parties had given on the subject.<lb/>
Were we, then, to try again for some compromise or joint settlement? What encouragement was there for an attempt of that kind? Our proposals had been scouted by Mr., Balfour. the Leader of the Opposition, and by all his friends in the House of, Commons. No alternative proposals whatever had been laid before the country except. those of Lord. Rosebery, and Lord Rosebery's proposals were confined to the composition of the House of Lords. They did, not embrace anything relating to the deadlock or machinery for removing a deadlock in the relations and
<col>930</col>
powers of the Houses of Parliament, and it is now, by the very presence of Lord Lansdowne's Resolutions on the Paper, obviously admitted, as has been freely and unreservedly admitted in debate, that it is vital for the settlement of this question that you should consider not merely the composition of the House of Lords, but also the powers of the two Houses of Parliament and their relations one to the other.<lb/>
We had, I say, not heard of any proposal being placed either before Parliament or the public except the proposal relating to the composition of the House, and nothing relating to its powers. The utmost efforts of the Conference had failed. "You could not have eight men, or four men on either side, in whom their respective Parties more thoroughly trusted. I know that of my own colleagues, and I believe it frankly and fully of the gentlemen who represented the Conservative Party, that you could not have, men who were more really and honestly anxious for an honourable settlement if they could obtain it. That failed, and failed, as your Lordships may recollect; Mr. Balfour said&#x2014;I am paraphrasing his language&#x2014;for the reason that from his point of view he could not accept the proposals and ideas put forward by the Liberal negotiators without betraying his Party. My Lords, I believe it has been publicly stated that that is exactly the same frame of mind on our side. I agree that common consent is the best way of settling every difference. I believe above all that it is most desirable, because it is most durable, when you are trying to settle the Constitution difficulty. I think each Party ought, so far as they can, to try to meet the other, especially on matters of this kind. But a time comes when you find that consent is unattainable, and when you find it is unattainable one view or the other must prevail. It is impossible to prevent the question being settled in the only Constitutional way. There was only one course open to us when we considered most anxiously what we should do by all the light we had to see by. That was to say to the country, "You must decide. Our differences are irreconcilable. We tail do nothing more by way of accommodation, and the matter must be determined by the country itself."<lb/>
The decision to advise the Dissolution of Parliament, although it had been anticipated a few days before, was not announced
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0470"/>
<col>931</col>
until Friday last, November 18. On Monday possible authority in this House, gave us day, November 21, Lord Lansdowne laid on to understand that there were to be 300 or the Table his Resolutions as to meeting a 400 members of the House of Lords, and deadlock. Nothing of that kind had ever been, to my knowledge, announced before. Now, if that had been announced a month ago or twelve months ago in my opinion it would not have altered the situation. In point of fact it was not disclosed to Parliament or laid before the public in any way until after the Dissolution had been declared. You admit the grievance under which we lie. Nothing is placed before the country to meet it except the general Resolutions as to the composition of the House of Lords, which admittedly do not cover the whole ground. You meet us in Conference and we are unable to come to terms; and then three days after we are driven to a Dissolution out come these proposals to adjust the relations between the two Houses. It may be that it was inevitable that they should not come forward at any earlier date&#x2014;I am not concerned with that. Things will be exactly as they have been. In point of fact they were not published When there is a Liberal majority in the until three days after the Dissolution had House of Commons, I have no doubt been announced. In those circumstances is not rather hard to say that we ought not to have dissolved, but that we ought to have considered these Resolutions?<lb/>
If we were now to advise the postponement of a Dissolution we should spend, perhaps, having regard to the magnitude of the subject, another twelve months in perfectly fruitless negotiations, and then at the end we should be, as we are at the present moment, obliged to appeal to those who are our masters and the masters of the House of Commons. That view is confirmed by an examination of Lord Lansdowe's proposals. I say that, hard as the grievance is under which are propounded in the Resolutions of Lord Lansdowne. You must take them in connection, of course, with the Resolutions of Lord Rosebery which deal with the composition of this House. See what is the effect of the two together. Lord Rosebery's Resolutions do not prescribe the number of members of the House of Lords, nor do they say how many members of the new House of Lords will consist of hereditary Peers selected by other hereditary Peers. But Lord Lansdowne and Lord Curzon also referred, rather in the nature of commentators on the text, to the Resolutions of Lord Rosebery, and Lord Lansdowne speaking with the highest
<col>932</col>
possible authority in this House, gave us to understand that there were to be 300 or 400 members of the House of Lords, and about one-half of the number were to hereditary Peers. That means an over-whelming Conservative majority, because the composition of this House ensure that few, very few, Liberals will be returned out of the 150 or 200 hereditary Peers. It interenches the Conservative Party in a majority in this House. It is to a House so composed, dominated by an overwhelming Conservative majority, that the scheme of Lord Lansdowne's Resolutions is to apply.<lb/>
How would it work in ordinary legislation&#x2014;not financial but ordinary legislation? When there is a Conservative majority in the House of Commons there will never be a difference between the two Houses at all. The consequence is there will never be occasion for a Joint Session. Things will be exactly as they have been. House of Commons, I have no doubt there will be plenty of constituted, and many Joint Sessions will be plenty of differences between the two Houses so constituted, and many Joint Sessions will be desirable. The whole crux of the question is how is a Joint Session to be composed. It is left designedly vague and indefinite in the Resolutions of Lord Lansdowne. He told us that he had left it vague on purpose. I make no complaint; I only call attention to the fact. It may be that the two Houses in their entirety are to meet. If so, one knows what chance any of our proposals would have unless there is an of Commons. It may be that it is to be done by delegation or committee of both Houses. If so, how can we possibly tell what the result will be except that the delegates of the House of Lords are sure to be in an overwhelming preponderance Conservative? How are we to know what the result will be unless we have some conception of the relative numbers of the delegations and whether or not any fair chance by that or any other method will be given to the Liberal Party in Joint Session? Those are very crucial questions. Those are the very pinch of the proposals, and we are told absolutely nothing and have no encouragement held out to us that we should get any satisfaction by means of a Joint Session or that there will be anything in its construction which will enable us to look forward to a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0471"/>
<col>933</col>
more happy fate than we have hitherto enjoyed under the present system.<lb/>
The same observations apply to a Referendum. That only conies into play, according to the text of Lord Lansdowne's Resolutions, if there is a difference between the two Houses, and if that difference relates to a matter which is of great gravity and has not been adequately submitted to t he judgment of the people. Then, again, when there is a Conservative House of Commons and a Conservative House of Lords no difference of opinion whatever will arise, and no Referendum will be needed; but when there is a Liberal majority in the House of Commons, almost any proposal, I am afraid, will appear to be matter of great gravity and will have to be settled by a Referendum. Under the Resolutions, I submit, the proposal for a Referendum is wholly one-sided. It will not apply when there is a Conservative House of Commons; it will apply when there is a Liberal House of Commons. But in the course of his speech Lord Lansdowne hinted that there might be&#x2014;although there is nothing of that kind appearing in the Resolutions&#x2014;there might be also means by which outsiders could claim a Referendum, even though both Houses were agreed. How or upon what conditions has not been pointed out. If I may restrict myself to my own opinion, I admit there may be cases in which the Referendum might be useful. They must be very exceptional cases, cases of a kind to which the ordinary procedure of Parliament is for some reason inapplicable.<lb/>
Without expressing a view on the subject of the claim of women for the vote, on which no Party is agreed, and upon which, therefore, by a General Election conducted on Party lines it seems almost impossible that a decision can be arrived at representing the opinion of the constituencies, I can conceive that on a subject of that kind the Referendum might be useful in a very rare and almost unique case. But if it is ever to he carried into effect it ought to be by special Act of Parliament applicable to the particular and separate question, and not by introducing the Referendum into the general Constitutional system of the country. I am not a Conservative, and I am not in the least afraid of change. I do not wish to pose as a dealer in Conservative argument; but I want to say that, if you introduce the
<col>934</col>
Referendum as part of the working Constitution of this country, you must either restrict it to the case of a difference between the two Houses of Parliament, in which case it will apply only to Liberal Bills, or you must allow outsiders by some method undescribed to appeal against both Houses of Parliament through the Referendum to the country. I do not know whether your Lordships contemplate a step of that kind. It would amount to government by <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i> instead of Parliamentary government to which we have been accustomed, and I cannot help thinking that a great deal of very grave argument and reflection would be needed before we commit ourselves to any such proposition. It would destroy the sense of the responsibility of the House of Commons and it would be a more far-reaching and revolutionary change than as yet has been proposed in regard to our Constitution. I believe it would be unsound and dangerous.<lb/>
There is only one part of these Resolutions left to which I would refer&#x2014;namely, that relating to finance. It has been so fully dealt with by my noble friend, Lord Crewe, that I have really nothing more that I can add in regard to it. It does seem to me that it really concedes very little to the House of Commons, and probably on the balance this proposal in regard to finance takes more from the House of Commons than it gives to the House of Commons in the way of control. If all these Resolutions were adopted and applied to-morrow I am afraid they would amount to no Substantial abatement whatever of the grievances under which we admittedly suffer. Those grievances are that we, the Government of the country, are powerless and are unable to have our proposals carried, not on a rare single occasion, but often, and unable even to have our proposals considered beyond the Second Reading. These Resolutions of the noble Marquess do really nothing, and not only do they do nothing but they proceed upon lines absolutely contradictory to the lines upon which our best-considered proposals go&#x2014;on lines consolidating and strengthening the Conservative majority in this House, or at all events leaving them of equal strength in their conflicts with the House of Commons when a Liberal majority is in power. They take away from the Crown the only power that exists at the present time&#x2014;an extreme
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0472"/>
<col>935</col>
power, I quite admit&#x2014;by which this House can be checked. Every authority in this country is liable to be checked. The House of Commons is liable to be checked by Dissolution. The Crown is liable to be checked by refusal of Supplies. This House is liable to be checked by the creation of Peers and in no other way. The creation of Peers would be valueless, as a remedy if the Resolutions of the noble Earl were passed, and the Resolutions of the noble Marquess were added to them. I have tried to state to your Lordships, I hope without passion, the reasons by which we have acted. On these reasons we shall have to be judged by the country, and we are prepared heartily and willingly to accept the decision of our countrymen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02348"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to address your Lordships under the impression which is always produced, certainly upon me and I believe upon almost every one of your Lordships, by the speeches of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. He is invariably so courteous in manner, so moderate in tone, so widely remote, as he claimed at the commencement of his remarks, from anything like rhetoric or recrimination, and so mild in the admonitions which he addresses to those of us who sit on this side of the House, that really when we listen to him we feel almost tempted to say, in scriptural language, "Almost thou persuadest me to be" something which I am not. But as I listened to the noble and learned Lord the one feeling that prevailed in my mind more than any other was, Is it possible that the noble and learned Lord, so gentle and so persuasive as he is, can really be the colleague of Statesmen, occupying a position scarcely inferior to his own, whose style and whose attitude generally is unfortunately modelled, if I may say so, on that of howling Dervishes rather than on that with which the noble and learned Lord invariably enchants this House.<lb/>
I do not, of course, say that the language of the noble and learned Lord ought to be interpreted in the terms of the language of his colleagues. I am sure he would shrink himself from any such suggestion. But at least your Lordships must remember when discussing this issue that His Majesty's Government speaks with two voices. There is the voice of sobriety and moderation and reasonable
<col>936</col>
argument which we hear from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, and, I may also add, from the noble Earl the Leader of the House, and then there is the voice of coarse invective and unscrupulous misrepresentation to which we are becoming daily, I may say, more and more habituated in the platform performances of some of the colleagues of those two noble Lords. The noble and learned Lord commenced his remarks as, if I may say so without impertinence, he has done on previous occasions, by recapitulating according to his own ideas the events of the past five years-1905&#x2013;1910. We are familiar with his views upon that branch of the question. They have been answered many times with greater or less effectiveness from these Benches. I do not propose to endeavour to repeat the operation to-night. I would not venture to say that the argument of the noble and learned Lord in that respect is inappropriate to the present discussion, but I do say that it is not directly germane to the consideration of the Resolutions which the noble Marquess has placed upon the Paper.<lb/>
We have only heard one speech so far this afternoon, but I think your Lordships who were present yesterday could not fail to have been very much struck by the general course which has been pursued in this debate. For my own part I have been much astonished at the general consensus of opinion that has been exhibited. Those of us who sit on this Bench hardly expected that the noble Marquess, in putting his Resolutions on the Paper, would meet with the unanimous approval that has at any rate so far been exhibited on this side of the House. The noble Earl who leads the House appealed yesterday to those noble Lords who sit on the Back Benches on both sides to favour us with their views, and he may perhaps have expected that there would be some rift in the lute on our side, or at any rate that the Government policy would receive support from his side.<lb/>
But what happened? Only three Peers spoke from the Opposition back benches last night, and not one of them expressed any approbation of the policy now being pursued by His Majesty's Government. There is a noble Lord, Lord Ribblesdale, who always speaks not merely with great charm and ability but with absolute independence on this question. He told us
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0473"/>
<col>937</col>
that he accepted, I think he even said he swallowed whole, the Resolutions of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. Then there was Lord Weardale. He is a noble Lord whose democratic sentiments are unimpeachable and whom, in the old days in the House of Commons, I would describe as a good Party man. But the noble Lord, having been translated to this House, told us last night that he protested most strongly against, the circumstances under which this issue was being referred to the people without adequate discussion in either House of Parliament, and he, also as a democrat and on democratic grounds, put in a strong plea for the Referendum which forms part of the proposals of the noble Marquess. Then we had the speeches of the two most reverend Prelates who represent the leading ecclesiastical organisation in this country. They of course did not speak on Party lines, but it is perfectly clear from their speeches that they hold that it is not on the lines of political cleavage or by Party warfare that this question can be settled, but rather that it should be by co-operation and contribution on the part of both sides of this House that it will ultimately be determined.<lb/>
Up to this moment then there has been a wonderful consensus of opinion among all those who have spoken in this debate except the speakers on the front Government bench. There has been a consensus of opinion that the situation has been materially altered by the Resolutions placed on the Paper by the noble Marquess even at this late date&#x2014;a date inevitably late, not owing to any fault of our own, but owing to circumstances outside our control. There has been a general agreement that these Resolutions provide a basis for statesmanlike discussion in your Lordships' House and possibly even material for agreement at a future date. There has been a general agreement that a Dissolution has been forced upon us&#x2014;I say this in spite of the defence that has just been offered by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack&#x2014;in a wanton and in. an inexcusable way, and, further, that this General Election is about to be fought on false and distorted issues in which the country will be asked to give its verdict upon a situation of which it is not fully seized and upon a policy that has never been thoroughly debated in either House of Parliament.<lb/>

Yesterday I took note of one admission which fell from the noble Earl the Leader of the House. It was the passage in which he said that if his Party were returned to power there would be opportunities given by which the Parliament Bill would be discussed freely over an ample space of time with abundant opportunity for amendment in both Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02349"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02350"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad to hear that statement on the part of the noble Earl, although I am not certain that it will have been read with equal satisfaction or concurrence by Mr. Redmond. I was glad to hear it because it disposes once and for all of the silly rumours that have been floating about that even if the Government were returned to power they propose by violent, coercive, and unconstitutional methods to force these proposals upon your Lordships' House. But in making that admission the noble Earl gave away the whole case for the Dissolution of Parliament. Is it not an absolute inversion of the ordinary theory of our Constitution and indeed of representative institutions in general? Surely the Constitutional procedure is to introduce a Bill into the House of Commons, to debate it there and allow amendment, and to bring it up here and then, if it is rejected or, in the opinion of the Government, crippled in its passage through this House, to take the matter to the arbitrament of the polls. But here the Government are doing exactly the opposite. They are having recourse to this ill-timed and stampede General Election upon a measure which has never been discussed in the House of Commons, which until a day or two ago was never brought before your Lordships' House, which, I venture to say, is wholly misunderstood by the electors at large, and with the terms of which probably not one man in 10,000 who is going to vote at the forthcoming election is in the least degree acquainted. If this be so, surely I am correct in saying that at the forthcoming election the issue which is going to be presented to the country is a false and distorted issue.<lb/>
I take up my papers this morning, being a diligent student of the utterances of His Majesty's Ministers, and there I read a very lurid and highly-coloured picture of
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0474"/>
<col>939</col>
the issues on which His Majesty's Government are going to appeal to the country. I may, say they do not in the least agree with the picture which we have just had from the noble and learned Lard on the Woolsack. I read, in the language of the Home Secretary, in that full-blooded style which we all appreciate, that the cause of the Dissolution is because your Lordships' House oppose a dead blank wall of arbitrary refusal to the policy of His Majesty's Government. Is that consistent with our attitude on the present occasion in the proposals we are now discussing? In language more picturesque and even less associated with facts, the Chancellor of the Exchequer says that the reason why the Government are going to the country is that 600 men chosen by nobody&#x2014;I must say I thought about forty of them had been chosen by the present and the recent leaders of the Party opposite&#x2014;in whom are included the whole of the Bench opposite and five or six members of the Cabinet, arrogate the right to govern, and claim to possess superior wisdom to, 45,000,000 people.<lb/>
I put to myself and I put to noble Lords this question. Let us suppose that an intelligent foreigner came to this country at the present time and that he was taken, as intelligent foreigners always are, to see the sights of the metropolis; that in the course of the afternoon he was permitted to read the election address of the Home Secretary and that in the evening, in order to complete the day's entertainment, he was taken to Mile-end or St. Pancras. Supposing that after that he came down to your Lordships' House in order to see the 600 tyrants who, to use the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have never done a. decent day's work in their lives, who do nothing all day long&#x2014;this includes the front Bench opposite&#x2014;year after year, but hunt and shoot and ride&#x2014;I do not identify the description in my own case and I dare say it is equally fallacious in that of other noble Lords&#x2014;and supposing he were to listen to this two days' debate in which we are now engaged, What would such an intelligent foreigner say? I suppose his first remark would be, "It is a mad world, my masters, in which we live." But surely he would go on to say that the system of government under which such a thing is possible must be one of the worst systems in the world; and if he went beyond that and were examining the conditions
<col>940</col>
under which a reform of this system of government were possible surely he would be more likely to look to the temperate and valuable and reasonable discussion which has been going on for the past two days in this House than to the random utterances of the platform to which I have referred.<lb/>
In the course of his remarks the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack reproached us, as we have more than once been reproached before, that it is so late in the day that we have come before the country with these proposals for dealing with the relations between the two Houses. He asks&#x2014;Why did you never look into the question before? He almost hinted, although of course he did not adopt phraseology so unpleasant, that this was a death-bed repentance on our part. Of all the charges brought against us that is one that personally afflicts and distresses me most because it is the one that seems to me to be least consistent with the facts. What are the facts of the case? At the last General Election I suppose there is scarcely one of us interested in the matter of the House of Lords who spoke about it who did not say that the reform of the Constitution involved as an indispensable corollary the readjustment of the relations between the two Chambers. We went on to say, and still hold, that the reform of the House was the indispensable preliminary to taking up the second part of the programme. And why? The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack himself supplied the answer. He told us not ten minutes ago that the real <i>crux</i> of this matter in the future will be the determination of the joint sitting between the two Houses&#x2014;the proportions that come from one House or the other, the adequate representation of different parties and interests. Yes, quite true. But the whole claim of the House of Lords to adequate representation in the joint sitting must depend on whether we are or are not a reformed Chamber. If our numbers are reduced and if our composition is improved surely we should be entitled to a different form of treatment from that which we might have if we remain as we are. Therefore it is that we have, wisely I think, always put proposals for the reform of the constitution of the House in front of proposals for the readjustment of our relations. The second question cannot be decided till the first is out of the way.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0475"/>
<col>941</col>
I think there is a further answer to the noble and learned Lord. As soon as the election was over the noble Earl upon the Cross Benches did introduce his Resolutions for reform, and 1 am in the recollection of the House when I remind them that the first three we did carry with no difficulty, though after adequate discussion, and that the remaining three we were prepared to take up when that melancholy event occurred to which allusion has been made, then it is asked, Why did not you proceed at that moment with proposals to deal with the relations of the two Houses? Is not the answer clear? The Conference had taken up the matter. The great majority of the members of your Lordships' House know very little what went on and I am sorry to say are never likely to know what went on in the Conference; but is there a single man in this House who is such a simpleton as to believe that these eight statesmen met twenty-one times, for several hours at a time, extending over four or five months, without discussing the relations of the two Houses? It is a matter not only of legitimate inference, but I might almost say of general knowledge, that that was the main subject of their discussions if at such a moment we had acted in the manner in which the noble and learned Lord seems to think we ought to have acted, and proposals had been introduced for dealing with this branch of the question, should we not have been at once accused of a gross breach of etiquette, of infringing the sort of Constitutional truce which had been agreed upon between both Parties and of taking upon ourselves that particular function which the Conference had been set up to carry out. The Conference then broke down, and the noble and learned Lord himself admitted that it was within a very few days of the breakdown that the noble Marquess tabled his Resolutions.<lb/>
It is quite conceivable that His Majesty's Government are not altogether very pleased with our tactics. I think that emerged from something said by the Leader of the House yesterday when he was kind enough to tell us what he thought the tactics were we ought to have pursued. At once we realised, I do not like to say the cloven hoof, but at any rate the inner meaning of the suggestion of the noble Earl. He said we ought to have discussed the Government Bill, and that either we might have accepted it, and moved a limited number of Amendments&#x2014;Amendments which he
<col>942</col>
himself told us only a week ago would be treated with no courtesy or consideration on his side&#x2014;or we might simply have accepted the Second Reading, in which ease of course we should at once have been taunted by His Majesty's Government, and still more by their followers in the country, with having accepted their policy and with having thrown up what the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, in an access of felicitous and hilarious gaiety, last night described as the hereditary sponge; or, as the noble Earl went on to say, we might have rejected the Second Reading of the Bill. No doubt that would have been equally agreeable to His Majesty's Government because then we should have given them the very excuse for a Dissolution which they are now wanting. The tactics of the Government, if I rightly describe them, have been frustrated by the action of the noble Marquess. They have only themselves to thank if this action does not entirely satisfy them, but I think it has fulfilled its purpose of placing before this House and the country in clear and unmistakable terms the fact that there is alternative on our side, a serious and statesmanlike alternative; arid that, as the result of this debate, it meets with a great deal of popular acceptance on both sides of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I may perhaps be permitted to make a few observations upon those parts of the proposals of the noble Marquess to which the Lord Chancellor has referred. The first is that of the Joint Sitting between the two Houses. It has been, I think, a very remarkable thing that that particular feature of the proposals has met with almost universal approval. I do not think it has excited a dissentient voice on either side of this House. It is, as we know, a plan that is adopted in our Colonies, and it is adopted in a rather different form in the Constitution of France. The only criticism that was passed upon it by the Leader of the House yesterday was, if he will allow me to say so, rather a petty and ineffective criticism. He said, "What are you going to do if these two bodies are going to meet each in <i>plenum?</i> How are you going to find a hall adequate for such numbers&#x2014;you may have to engage Olympia for the purpose?" Even if such 'a thing were contemplated, there does happen to be in close proximity to your Lordships' House an ancient and historic hall, which has been the scene of many of the most
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0476"/>
<col>943</col>
famous events in British history, which would be perfectly capable of accommodating even such numbers. But I could not help thinking, while the noble Earl was making this suggestion, whether the consideration is one which might not in the future be pertinent to him. We have very often heard the suggestion that it might one day be the duty of His Majesty's Government to add a very large number to the members of your Lordships' House, such a number, under the schemes which have been contemplated, as would amount to 500 Peers. Five hundred Peers added to the present number of your Lordships' House would compose a total of 1,100 men. It is conceivable, therefore, in these circumstances, that the problem of engaging Olympia is one which some day may present itself to His Majesty's Government. But, after all, is not all this really rather beside the issue, and is it not perfectly certain that no one would contemplate the two Houses meeting in <i>plenum?</i> Is it not perfectly certain that when they did meet, if ever they did meet, there would be delegations sent from the two Houses of Parliament?<lb/>
Then the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack says, "How are we to know that a reasonable and fair delegation would be sent up from the House of Lords? How do we know that the contributions that you send would not swamp whatever Radical majority there might be in the House of Commons" It is true that one cannot answer that question definitely at the present moment, but surely it all depends on the spirit in which an agreement, if agreement there ever be, is arrived at? Surely it all depends upon the degree of confidence in which either side feels justified in reposing in the sincerity of the other? Of course, if you think that these Resolutions are merely setting up a new plan under which, with a <i>simulacrum</i> of reform, our Party are merely desiring to stereotype the predominance of their own side or to reproduce the existing conditions of which they, just as much as you, complain, then it is no good discussing the matter further. You are quite entitled to object to our proposals, but if you assume&#x2014;and there is no one to whom I may appeal with greater confidence in a matter like this than to the Lord Chancellor&#x2014;that we approach this matter in the spirit of fairness and sincerity and with a desire to arrive at a solution which you have claimed for yourselves, is it not
<col>944</col>
a little unfair to us to suppose that we are going at every stage to "queer the pitch"? I believe that in this matter there must be a certain give and take between the two Parties, and we are just as much entitled to ask from the noble and learned Lord an admission of our sincerity as he is, when he speaks to us in this House, to claim it from us.<lb/>
Then I pass on to the next question to which the noble and learned Lord referred &#x2014;the Referendum. There is no one on this side of the House who would not at once admit that the Referendum is a novel, difficult, and complicated question. It is not a question on which we can derive very much assistance from the practice of foreign countries, because, although the Referendum does exist elsewhere as we all know, its existence there can really only be quoted as a precedent rather than an analogy. But may I, in the few observations I still have to make, endeavour to combat one or two, at any rate, of the misapprehensions to which I think the suggestion of the Referendum has been subjected in the debate in your Lordships' House. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said yesterday that he thought it would be an unsuccessful expedient because few people would vote. Is that a reasonable anticipation? In this country you have political interest developed in our democracy to a degree that exists in no other European and, I would add, in no American State. To such an extent is this the case that at the last General Election you had, I believe, an average of over ninety per cent.&#x2014;I believe in many cases it was ninety-four and ninety-five per cent.&#x2014;of the voters going to the poll. Is it, therefore, any less likely, when you have an issue submitted to the people by Referendum, an issue with which they are certain to be familiar in advance, which must have excited a great deal of Party interest, that they will treat the matter so cavalierly as to be unwilling to place their votes on paper, or, if there is to be a poll, to go to the poll? I submit to you, with deference, that the suggestion that the Referendum would be burked or shirked by the people is one as to which we need not feel any apprehension at all.<lb/>
Then as to the question of cost. The Chancellor of the Exchequer goes about making speeches in which he says the cost will amount to two millions sterling, which
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0477"/>
<col>945</col>
is at the rate of 5s. 8d. a head for an electorate calculated at seven millions of persons. Is it in the least degree necessary that, if you have a Referendum, the whole of the trouble of a General Election, its long delays, its numerous meetings, its expenses both personal and official, should be reproduced? It may, perhaps, be too much to expect that a Referendum could be carried through by the Post Office in a single day, though I do not think myself that is altogether incredible. At the same time I think it is quite certain that, with a few days' time, a small staff of officials would be adequate for the purpose, and that, instead of costing something like two millions sterling, the cost would not be more than between &#x00A3;150,000 and &#x00A3;200,000. And that, observe, would not fall on individual candidates as the cost of an election does now, but would, naturally, be borne by the nation as a whole.<lb/>
Then, there is the difficulty which has been raised as to the manner in which the issue shall he presented to the people by Referendum. I do not in the least dispute the seriousness of the difficulty, as all must know who have had the experience of standing for popular election. It is a very difficult thing to put a complicated issue in a form, though it is often tried by hecklers in the body of a hall, which demands or requires the answer "Aye" or "No." But the difficulty experienced in putting the question for Referendum would be as nothing to the difficult), that is experienced at a General Election now. At a. General Election you have a perfect congeries, a huddle and muddle of programmes and policies, of Bills and cries, and on these you invite your elector to give a decision one way or the other. But what does he do? The utmost he can attempt to do is to strike a rough-and-ready balance between all the various conflicting considerations that appeal to his mind. What he generally does is to decide to give his vote in favour of a programme or Party or Party leader or individual candidate who is soliciting his suffrages. That is the way he gets out of his difficulties and that is the rough-and-ready system by which we solve these Constitutional problems. But these difficulties, serious as they are in our present system, would be nothing like so serious under the Referendum. Clearly the class of questions which go to Referendum would be much more easily put in a
<col>946</col>
concise and compact shape, admitting of "Aye" or "No," than are all the mixed and complicated issues that go before a General Election. I hope, therefore, we shall not be unduly disturbed by that apprehension.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to what is a very serious charge. The noble Earl the Leader of the House stated the objection the other day, and it was repeated by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. Lord Crewe said the Referendum was really a negation of the system of representative government; and that was followed by the noble and learned Lord when he said that it would destroy the sense of responsibility of members of the House of Commons. Of course, that is a serious charge to bring against it, although I am not certain that that sense of responsibility at the present moment remains altogether unimpaired. What does the charge mean? I suppose it means that Members of Parliament would say, "Never mind what we do, never mind what vote we give. The matter will be settled by the people, and therefore we may be indifferent." Mr. Lloyd George put it in rather more crude language. I imagine he meant the same thing when he said yesterday that the Referendum would be a device for insulting the House of Commons and debasing and diminishing its authority.<lb/>
I remember many years ago reading the circumstances under which the Referendum was introduced in Switzerland. Exactly the same apprehensions were expressed on that occasion&#x2014;that it was going to destroy all sense of personal and individual responsibility. It has had in Switzerland, and I believe it would have here, exactly the opposite effect. I myself believe that it would stimulate the sense of responsibility of individual Members of Parliament, because they would feel that they might be called to account by a Referendum of the. people at no short date afterwards. And still more, I think, it would go a long way to prevent that log-rolling and that wire-pulling which is one of the curses of the Party system in the form it has taken in this country. I own I share the surprise of the noble Lord, Lord Weardale, that the Referendum is looked upon with so much suspicion by noble Lords opposite. It is essentially democratic in its character. Its basis is the belief, to which we all, on both sides of the House, give expression
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0478"/>
<col>947</col>
in our public utterances, that in the last resort we accept the will of the people, and I am at a loss to understand why, when it is put forward in this proposal, it should be greeted with so much doubt, and, apparently, with so much dismay by those who profess to be the real representatives of the democracy in this country.<lb/>
I do not think that, while I am speaking of the Referendum. I need allude to one other argument against it which has been uttered, not, it is true, in this House, but in a more congenial atmosphere outside. Yesterday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Referendum was "a one-sided Party dodge, by which the Party with riches and vested interests would crush down the democracy with the sheer weight of gold." I confess I do not understand that. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's conception of society in this country is that it consists of two classes &#x2014;one, the rich, who are mainly composed of noble Lords and their friends on this side of the House, and the other, the poor, of whom he is the sole spokesman and champion, and that it is his business in the world to rehabilitate society by placing the heels of the pour on the necks of the rich. That is an intelligible, though I think a fundamentally fallacious, view of society. But how he applies it to the Referendum, how the gold of the rich is to come in and crush the poor in the Referendum, I fail altogether to see, and how the democracy is to be injured by being asked to pronounce upon any political issue that may for the time being be before the country I altogether fail to comprehend.<lb/>
My Lords, only one other point which the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack referred to. It is really connected with the point I was taking just now about the suspicion with which the noble and learned Lord appears to regard our proposals. He was talking about the proportions that might be adopted in a reformed House of Lords as affecting both this House and the Joint Sitting, and also about the circumstances under which the reference might be made and recourse might be had to the Referendum, and he pictured a House of Lords composed in much the same manner and proportions as now, and he advanced certain calculations which led him to think that a reformed House of Lords would have about the same Conservative majority as now. Was the
<col>948</col>
noble and learned Lord entirely fair to our Party when he made that calculation? Did he really do justice to the proposals of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches? Does lie not remember that the other day when we were discussing the matter it was agreed and accepted on both sides that a reformed House of Lords is not to consist in the main of hereditary Peers; that there is to be not only a large infusion but I think it was said that at least one-half of your Lordships' House was to he nonhereditary and was to be recruited from outside by popular methods? Is it not to be supposed that the Party opposite will have at least as much chance of obtaining a majority as we shall? It may be if they are in power they will have a greater chance. Is it not the case also that even among hereditary members there will be members qualified by official position? Is it not certain that all the noble Lords opposite, who, as one of them remarked to-night, adorn that Bench, will be included even in the hereditary portion of the reformed House of Lords? I think, therefore, that the noble and learned Lord was a little unfair to us in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02351"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: May I explain that the only ground on which I did assume, I think legitimately, that there would be an overwhelming Conservative majority was this.

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02353"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Then I beg the noble Lord's pardon. I understood so. No numbers were named at all by the noble Earl who proposed it, but, as I understood, Lord Lansdowne intimated the opinion that about one-half would be hereditary Peers. The consequence was I was brought to assume that the Peers would vote according to their opinions, and their opinions would be Conservative as they are now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02354"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I quite accept what is said by 'the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, but I think lie has misinterpreted what fell from my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. The scheme of Lord Rosebery does indeed propose that of the reformed House
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0479"/>
<col>949</col>
of Lords about one-half shall be hereditary Peers, but it was not proposed that the whole of that portion should be elected by your Lordships' House. There is also the element of official qualification. Opinions differ as to whether a large or a small proportion of that hull should be returned to the House of Lords by that method; but, be it large or small, it; is perfectly certain that noble Lords opposite will have as ample on opportunity of qualifying under that test as we who sit on this side of the House.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, I think I have followed the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack through the greater part of the criticisms which he directed against these Resolutions. May I say this in conclusion? We commend these Resolutions as an honest and sincere attempt, not merely to reform the constitution of this House, but, to give a Liberal Government who may be in power in the House of Commons in future a better chance for themselves and for their measures than, we are ready to admit, they have hitherto enjoyed. They do present a clear and definite alternative in our view to the policy of the Government as outlined in the so-called Parliament and in so far as they are vague and undefined&#x2014;and we admit that&#x2014;we say that is a necessary concomitant of the present stage of their evolution, and noble Lords opposite must give us sonic measure of trust as to the manner in which we shall translate them into practice if one day we are a Government and no longer in Opposition. They have this further advantage, that they do preserve in the Constitution of the country the existence of a Second Chamber, which is not merely a Constitutional figment or a miserable phantom, but which would be a serious and solid feature of our political system. They are also based on the democratic principle which we must all accept as the last resort in controversial issues that the voice of the people shall prevail.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord told us more than once that the whole question of the future of this House resolves itself into two chapters. That is true. It is a book with two pages. On the first of these pages you have to write your scheme for reform of this Chamber. On the second page you have to write the manner in which you propose to adjust its relations with the House of Commons. Very well. Now contrast our scheme with that of the
<col>950</col>
Government. Whitt is written on their first page? Nothing at all&#x2014;only the dim, misty, nebulous outline&#x2014;it is barely an outline&#x2014;of a reformed House of Lords as remotely indicated in the precious Preamble of the Parliament Bill. On their second page is inscribed the continued existence of an unreduced and unreformed House of Lords still possessing all the anomalies which they continually denounce on the platform and exercising only tile discredited and relatively petty functions of procrastination and delay. On our first page is written the constitution which is proposed to us by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. It is a serious and sincere attempt to provide a better Second Chamber. On the second of these pages will one day be written, we hope, the Resolutions of the noble Marquess which I am now supporting. I would almost stake the whole of my political existence on the prophecy that when the final adjustment comes it will be more in the direction of the pictures painted on the two pages of our book than in the direction of that which is depicted on the single page of the book of His Majesty's advisers. And, my Lords, if that be the case it will be a sufficient justification for the proposals the noble Marquess has put upon the Paper, and of which we ask the acceptance of the House of Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02355"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that no member of your Lordships' House can join in this debate without feeling a sense of deep responsibility, since we are called upon to discuss Resolutions relating to what is surely the gravest Constitutional issue which has ever been before us. I take part in it because I feel that it is the duty of every one to endeavour to get a clear issue, to endeavour to get our attitude towards the Government's proposals put perfectly plainly before the country &#x2014;a proceeding which I cannot but believe His Majesty's Government are most anxious to avoid. Only tai o or three days ago the noble Earl the Leader of the House informed us that a Dissolution would take place next week, a Dissolution based apparently on the hypothesis that your Lordships were going to amend or reject a measure which I think I am quite justified in saying His Majesty's Government had no intention should ever get to the Committee stage in this House. It throws a remarkable light on the present Cabinet's conception of Parliamentary government that they should give no adequate time for the discussion of a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0480"/>
<col>951</col>
vital Constitutional question in this House, or, I might say, in either House, simply because a purely informal Conference of eight men failed to come to an entire, agreement upon that subject. All politicians are not George Washingtons, and platform oratory, even when that platform is occupied by a Radical Cabinet Minister, is not the surest guide to knowledge. The deliberations of the Conference we all know must have resulted in a considerable amount of agreement after twenty-one sittings, yet, in spite of this, when the Government very unwillingly assented to the demand from this side of your Lordships' House and produced the Parliament Bill they presented it with the extraordinary statement that it was to be taken or left, that they were not prepared to listen to any reasoned criticism or to accept any Amendments. The action of His Majesty's Government has resulted in this House being called upon to consider measures vitally affecting its own powers, not only within the inadequate time allowed it, but under the shadow of an impending Dissolution.<lb/>
My Lords, it is impossible to discuss this question without comparing the Government's proposals with the Resolutions that have been put forward by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and in doing so the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack talked about the balance of power which at present exists between the Crown, the Lords, and the Commons. If I remember rightly, the Lord Chancellor referred in even more eloquent terms about a year ago to this same balance of power when he was deprecating our action over the Finance Bill. I think he referred to it at that time as the "envy of other nations." Well, my Lords, this Parliament Bill utterly destroys that balance of power which, in the Lord Chancellor's words, is the envy of other nations. We on this side of the House, in the proposals put forward by the noble Marquess, agree in the readjustment of that balance of power, but we propose to increase the power of the people to deal with those questions which affect their every-day life and their well-being. The Radical Party on their side propose to decrease the power of the people and to increase the bureaucratic power of the Ministry of the day. On this side of the House we recognise that the two Houses of Parliament are the servants of the electors of the country, and all we ask is that when those Houses interpret divergently the
<col>952</col>
wishes of those electors, the issue should be put to the nation at large to decide. The cry which was often in the mouths of the older Liberals in old days was, "Trust the people." My Lords, their new cry, as voiced only last Saturday by the noble Earl who presides over the Board of Agriculture is, "Trust Asquith." Indeed, the two opposing policies of the Parties can be summed up thus: The Radical Party ask for a blank cheque to be given to the Ministry of the day; we wish to put all the power into the hands of the people. The Radical Party are placing excessive powers in the hands of the Cabinet, and we must remember that these excessive powers will necessarily reside not only in a Radical Cabinet, but in any Cabinet, however composed. I for my part frankly declare that as a supporter of representative government I should not care to see even a Unionist Cabinet possessed of these omnipotent powers over Parliament and people.<lb/>
Under this Parliament Bill it is proposed that any measure which passes the House of Commons three times is to become law whatever view the Second Chamber may take of it. I was, unfortunately, not here last night, but I read in <i>The Times</i> this morning that the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, asked, "What is the objection to that?" I might ask the noble Earl in return, "Why pass a Bill three times in the one Parliament? Is the same House of Commons going to alter its opinion&#x2014;or rather, whatever the opinon of its members may be, are they going to be permitted to vote according to their consciences and free from their Party Whips?" We know what the Party system has come to. There are very few members of the House of Commons who dare take an independent line. I think the only member of that House I have met who was really independent was Mr. Harold Cox, and we all know that his independence resulted in a very quick termination of what we had hoped would be a brilliant Parliamentary career. The fact is that the power of the private member of the House of Commons to exert any influence on legislation to-day has been reduced to a vanishing point. He is whipped into the Party Lobby in support of closure Resolutions which have probably had the effect of preventing any free discussion on measures which he has been sent to the House of Commons by his constituents to study and examine and vote upon. Can his vote be said to represent his opinion or the opinion
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0481"/>
<col>953</col>
of his constituents, who have probably never even seen or heard of or discussed those measures? His vote represents one thing and one thing only, and that is the opinion or the policy of the Prime Minister of the day.<lb/>
In old days Bills before Parliament did receive some criticism and examination by members of the House of Commons. Today a Government Bill can no longer be said to represent the free discussion of a Legislative Assembly. Such a measure comes up to this House as the product of the decrees registered by a small Committee composed of the Ministry of the day. I would recall what was said on this point with great clearness by the present Home Secretary, although it is interesting to note that the statement was made before he had attained Ministerial rank and thereby joined the ruling caste. In 1905 Mr. Winston Churchill said&#x2014;
<quote>"The House must remember the increasing power of the Executive and the decline of Parliamentary authority";</quote>
and he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"We have borrowed front foreign nations almost every device which could weaken a representative institution, and we have rejected almost every safeguard which could control executive Government."</quote>
The proposals of the Government in the Parliament Bill go a great deal further in the direction of weakening Parliamentary authority, and now, at a time when legislative control is more than ever required in the interests of the nation, His Majesty's Government come forward with proposals which would put more absolute power into the hands of the Cabinet of the day than has ever been extended at any time to any governing body either in this or any other country which possesses Constitutional Government. Under the Government scheme the only check which would exist on the House of Commons, or the chance majority which ruled it, would lie in the prospect of an election two or three years off. My Lords, this is no check. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet, if they found themselves in a tight place&#x2014;the sort of tight place that His Majesty's Government have been in ever since they got into power&#x2014;would say to themselves, "Two or three years is a long way off; people's memories are short, our delinquencies will he forgotten, and in any case in those years we hope to bring forward new proposals which would obscure the people's judgment."<lb/>
<col>954</col>
It is true that this Parliament Bill is adorned with a Preamble giving some undefined powers to an undefined Second Chamber at some undefined future date. But, my Lords, is it likely that extreme politicians of the type of Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Winston. Churchill, having once tasted the sweets of unbridled power, will consent to a restriction of those powers? If that was their intention why do they set up what is actually, whether intentionally or not, a single-Chamber Constitution? Why do they do that if they intend at sonic future date to revert to a double-Chamber Constitution? There is an answer to that, and it is that they intend in the interval to pass into law measures of which they know the country would never approve. It is a very transparent scheme, and I do not believe that anybody in the country will be deceived by it. They have Only to read and inwardly digest Mr. Redmond's very frank speeches in order to see the origin and aims of those man&#x0153;uvres. Another point that we have to consider is this. When these unpopular measures have been passed, when Ireland has been given Home Rule, will there not still be factions in the house of Commons who will put pressure on the Prime Minister and demand, as the price of their support, other privileged legislation for themselves at the expense of the rest of the community, and. in order to pass those measures will not the Cabinet be forced to still go on exercising these powers?&#x2014;powers which could only be checked by some such method of appealing to the people as is afforded by the Resolutions which we are discussing to-night.<lb/>
My Lords, there are other grave disabilities in this Bill. The first thought of a Government under the Parliament Bill must be to introduce its most unpopular and its most controversial measures as rapidly as possible, allowing as little discussion as possible before the two years elapse during which they possess an absolute power of putting those measures on to the Statute Book. There would he even less discussion than there is at present in the House of Commons. The closure would become an absolute Party necessity, and free discussion would become a. thing of the past. The Parliament Bill in itself is a very good instance of the unjust, undemocratic, pernicious sort of measure which, having received no consideration and no kind of criticism in the House of Commons, could be forced on an unwilling country. Under
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0482"/>
<col>955</col>
that Bill, presented to your Lordships with the remarkable statement that it is to be taken or left, that it is to be passed without the alteration of a single comma, a measure can be passed into law without having received one hour of examination in the House of Collations. My Lords, how very simple the process of future legislation is going to be. Before a. measure had even seen the light of day the all-mighty Minister could put forward a closure Resolution securing its passage through all its stages without one hour of debate. Yet His Majesty's Government say they are so satisfied with their Bill that they are unwilling to listen to any criticism or to accept any Amendments. If we go back in the history of this country to the only time when we enjoyed the "blessings" of single-Chamber Government, we find that the first act of the Long Parliament was to abolish the House of Lords. The next day they abolished the Monarchy, and the next month they set to work to draw up a list of offences to be adjudged high treason. Very naturally, the first thing they did was to make any criticism of themselves an act of high treason.<lb/>
There were many other alternatives which might have commended themselves to His Majesty's Government, but in view of the attitude which the Government have taken up, in view of the fact that they are unwilling to listen to any reasoned criticism of their Bill, I am glad that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has taken the only course which was open to him of putting plainly before the country the proposals which he advises this House to accept, proposals which I myself am perfectly willing to support. The Resolution dealing with Bills other than Money Bills in its proposal for a joint sitting of the two Houses follows very closely on the proposal for which the noble Earl the Leader of the House made himself responsible the other night, and which is to be found in the Union of. South Africa Act passed by His Majesty's Government last year. I know that it was said several times last night that a joint sitting of the two Houses would, under present conditions, be no use. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, referred to it just now in regard to something the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack had said. It is true that the proposal is of no use with a large Unionist majority in this House. But why then have the Government never shown any
<col>956</col>
inclination to join in the reform of your Lordships' House? I honestly believe that the last thing which the Liberal Party want is to remove the anomalies in the constitution of your Lordships' House, because it would result in depriving them of the weapon of abuse of the hereditary system which they find so useful for platform oratory at General Elections. But, my Lords, they know perfectly well that, in accepting the Resolutions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches last March and again last week, we have abandoned once and for all the principle that a man shall sit in this House simply because he is the son of his father, and there is no reason to-day why a more permanent representation of the Liberal Party should not find their way on to the Benches opposite. We on this side of the House would welcome them, for we are fighting for no Party privileges but for an effective Second Chamber, and if the noble Earl opposite, the Prime Minister, Sir Edward Grey, and others were free from the shackles of their Hibernian allies they would jump at this opportunity of a settlement. Instead of this, we are asked to remove the one check on the other House which makes democratic Government possible.<lb/>
Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to quote one short sentence from Burke in dealing with a great Constitutional question. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It must always be the aim of an unconstitutional Minister that a House of Commons which is entirely dependent upon him should have every right of the people entirely dependent upon that pleasure."</quote>
My Lords, does it not seem as if the prophetic soul of Burke foresaw the aims and intentions of His Majesty's present Government, a Government which the noble Earl admitted only the other evening dare not accept any amendment to their proposals because they knew, even before the noble Marquess's Resolutions were put forward, that the one Amendment which your Lordships in this House would insist upon would he to make some provision whereby grave and vital issues should be referred to the people. The other night when the question of the reform of this House was being discussed some noble Lord&#x2014;I think it was Lord Newton&#x2014;said that the naked and brutal truth was that many of us have got to go. Well, my Lords, I would add this: Let us all go if necessary, but if we do go let us go as

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02356"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I enter upon the discussion of these Resolutions with a feeling that unreality attaches to the whole debate. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has, in fact, intimated that we are wasting time in continuing the discussion, because the issues presented to this House and to the country and the claims put forward on either side are quite opposed to one another; they are really irreconcilable; there is no way, he said, of bridging the distance between the proposals of the Government and the proposals of the Opposition, and therefore there is nothing for us but to go to a General Election by which we can hasten the decision of the question. But, my Lords, I find it rather difficult to reconcile the position of my noble and learned friend with the invitation which was addressed to us by the Lord Privy Seal to engage in this debate. He must surely have thought that some purpose could be served when lie invited speeches from independent members of your Lordships' House or lie would not have invited such contributions to the debate, so that in his mind, at all events, some reconciliation must have seemed possible; and despite the apparent opposition between the plans of the Government and the plans proposed by the noble Marquess opposite, despite tile apparent absolute contrariety of their schemes, I confess to the opinion that the discussions in this House and out of this, House, the discussions during the progress of the General Election and the debates in Parliament in the coming year, will in the end probably lead to some solution differing from the propositions both of the Government and of the Opposition but possibly combining sonic of the features of both.<lb/>
At the commencement of this Parliament, indeed before the elections were completely over, surveying the situation as it then was, I ventured to express an opinion in print that we were in face of continual discussion of varied propositions, of Resolutions, Bills, and counter-Resolutions, of schemes brought forward apparently with little preparation, at all events with little notice, and of a repetition of something like what was experienced in the
<col>958</col>
Reform debates more than forty years ago. At that time we had Resolutions laid on the Table and then withdrawn; other Resolutions were substituted; then came Bill after Bill until at last out of the hubbub and continual debates in the House of Commons and in this place there resulted the Reform Act of 1867. So, my Lords, despite the language of my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack, who rather discouraged all attempt to maintain the debate to-night, I conceive that some good may vet come out of it, and that some contribution towards the solution of the problem which has occupied our minds and the minds of the country and must occupy them for some time to come may yet be forthcoming.<lb/>
What, after all, is the question that we have to consider? It has been put again and again, but I think it deserves restatement. We have in some way or other to get over the growing divergence between this House and the other House of Parliament. At one time they worked together as auxiliary Flits of a fairly effective Parliamentary machine, but they have ceased to work together. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has called attention to the impossibility of passing Liberal legislation, and His Majesty's Government have proposed a scheme for getting over that, difficulty. Now, what is the idea of that scheme?. The noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal said that we must take the two Houses as they are and try sonic method to secure the efficiency of the Parliamentary machine without entering on the question of an reconstruction of its parts, and the Parliament Bill is itself, no doubt, an attempt to get over that difficulty. It proposes to take the House of Commons as it is and the House of Lords as it is, and to provide that any Bill which is passed by the House of Commons and which practically survives two years may pass into law despite the resistance of this House. That, in short, is the scheme of His Majesty's Government. Can that be accepted as a way of bridging over the difficulty? My noble friend the Lord Privy Seal urges that it can.<lb/>
Before I proceed to that point let me say that the idea lying at the heart of both sides is that Parliament should become an effective machine&#x2014;to do what?&#x2014;to fulfil the mind of the nation. That is what Parliament has to do, and the test of all
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0484"/>
<col>959</col>
schemes for the reform of either House or for a reform of the relations between the two Houses is how far they tend to promote the efficiency of Parliament to fulfil the mind of the nation. I may say parenthetically, repeating what I have said perhaps too often before but what I believe is worth saving again, that in my opinion you cannot bring Parliament into effective working for the purpose of fulfilling the mind of the nation in a way that we can trust and rely upon except through a reform of the methods of the election of the House of Commons itself. That, my Lords, is the primary necessity, and the more the problem is reflected upon I believe the more the truth will be forced on all thinking minds.<lb/>
I will put that aside for the moment and deal with the proposition of the Lord Privy Seal. He says that if you take the House of Commons when newly elected you can certainly be sure that in those early days it does fairly represent the will of the nation; that since the scheme of the Parliament Bill can only apply to measures brought in at the commencement of a Parliament, introduced in the first session of a Parliament, the Bill therefore secures that the will of the nation, as we can trust it to be expressed in tire first session of a Parliament, will be secured; and that the Government are therefore helping to the fulfilment of the will of the nation by the introduction of the proposed machinery, because it applies to decisions of the House of Commons which can only be taken when the House of Commons is newly elected and fresh from the hustings. My noble friend, in continuing that argument, had to meet the awkward precedent of the election in 1892. In 1892 the election did result in a majority of the House of Commons in favour of Home Rule, and a Home Rule Bill was brought in in the first ensuing session of Parliament&#x2014;Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bill. The Lord Privy Seal admits that although there was a majority of forty in favour of that Bill immediately after the General Election and in the first session of the Parliament, yet that Bill had not really behind it the will of the nation. He practically admits that, not merely from the experience of what has happened since its rejection but from other considerations. He came frankly to the conclusion that the Home Rule Bill of 1892, although passed by a majority of forty in the first session of Parliament after
<col>960</col>
the General Election, a General Election which turned mainly upon the issue of Home Rule, still did not represent the will of the nation; but he met the difficulty by saving that after all there was no real danger whatever of that Bill being passed. It had only a majority of forty, there was opposition to it in this House, there was also strong opposition to it in the other House of Parliament, and in the course of two years in accordance with the inevitable attrition of political Parties there was a falling off of a number of its supporters here and there, and less cohesion amongst the adherents of the Government Party. The noble Earl says that all these things, which must be expected and which did happen at that time, would happen again, and that if a Bill were produced under similar circumstances, although supported by a majority of forty, as that Bill was, it would in the future, as in that case, not come into operation because the majority of forty could not be expected to be kept together during the necessary interval before the Bill would pass into law over the heads of this House.<lb/>
It is quite true that in the Parliament of 1892&#x2013;95 the majority did melt away, it is quite true that in the third year the Government were defeated, and so there is force in the argument of the Lord Privy Seal that there is no real danger at the present time of a Bill becoming law because it is supported in the first session of a Parliament if it has not also the support of the country at large. But my noble friend is guilty of the fallacy of importing considerations of what is likely to happen in the future leaving regard to the maintenance of conditions which have existed in tire past but without having regard to the fact that those conditions would not be likely to exist in the future. Conceive a repetition of our experience of that time. Conceive a House of Commons elected under the Parliament Bill and having a majority of forty. The fact of the Parliament Bill having become law would altogether alter the situation and change the conditions tending to the maintenance of unity among the supporters of the Government. If it could have been said in 1893, "We have a majority of forty in favour of the Home Rule Bill; let us only stick together for two years and the Bill is law," they would have stuck together for that period and the Bill would have become law. So in tire future if you are
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0485"/>
<col>961</col>
able to say at the commencement of a Parliament, "We are few in number, it is true, but we have only to keep together for two or three years and our Bills will become law," that influence itself would tend to keep the numbers together and the Bills in the end would become law. Therefore, my Lords the argument of my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal is entirely falsified by a consideration of the fact that if the Parliament Bill became law it would introduce a tremendous motive for cohesion and discipline in the ranks of Ministerialists which would keep the majority together and ensure the passage of their Bills despite the failure of support outside. So that we would not be free from the danger that a Bill might become law though not supported by the will of the nation.<lb/>
I will refer to another case as illustrating my point. I allude to the period of the Education Bill of 1906. Education was a very prominent question on the hustings before the Education. Bill of 1906 saw the light. That Bill was introduced and supported by a considerable majority, not so large a majority as that commanded generally by His Majesty's Government but by a considerable majority. But the subsequent conduct of that Bill and the attitude of the Government in relation to it showed a conviction on their part that there was some doubt as to whether they could claim the will of the nation as really being behind the provisions of that Bill. If they had been quite sure of it, the simple plan would have been to have had a General Election again with regard to it, or, at all events, to have intimated some line of action showing that they relied upon that power. But it was notorious&#x2014;it was confessed at the time&#x2014;that the Government, strong as they were, powerful as they were in the House of Commons, elected as they had been largely on the question of education, were still uncertain how far the country was in sympathy with them on the simple question of the fortunes of that Bill even in the reduced form in which it ultimately was hung up between the two Houses. If the fortunes of that Bill had been put in the form of a Referendum to the people of this country it was uncertain as to what would have been the result. You cannot rely on a decision of the House of Commons elected as it is now, even when taken in the first session of a Parliament, being a certain
<col>962</col>
exposition of the Will of the nation, and such a decision cannot be accepted as the expression of the popular will simply because it is maintained for two years.<lb/>
It is for these reasons that so many of us have felt hesitation with regard to the acceptance of the Parliament Bill in the simple form in which it has been put forward in your Lordships' House. It commits us to the dominance of a majority in the House of Commons who would be kept together by the sense that their power depended upon their keeping together, and yet that majority could not be trusted even at the outset as representing the will of the nation. My Lords, I come back to the conviction which I spoke of earlier in my speech, that unless you get an alteration in the method of election to 'the House of Commons so as to make it accurately reflect the mind of the country you cannot really solve this problem. It has been said with truth that nobody in this House other than occupants of the Ministerial Bench has said a word in favour of the provisions of this Parliament Bill. The three noble Lords who have spoken from this side have demurred to the acceptance of the Government measure. My noble friend below me, my noble friend behind me, and my noble friend Lord Mac-Donnell, the last one differing from the others on many points, all demurred to time acceptance of the Parliament Bill; they all thought that it could not be taken as it stood. That conviction is not confined to members of this House; I believe that the same view is taken by some of the members of the House of Commons who sit on the Government side.<lb/>
Early in this year there appeared suggestions of Joint Sittings and Joint Committees. A formal suggestion of that kind appeared in the column devoted to Parliamentary Correspondence in <i>The Times</i>, and it afterwards turned out that the scheme of joint siftings through Joint Committees was time conception of Liberal member of the House of Commons whose name was given. I am personally aware that in looking favourably upon that scheme he was not alone; he had friends in the House of Commons who took the same view. If a conviction of the inadequacy, not to put it too high, of the Parliament Bill is thus felt here and elsewhere, may not that explain the origin of the Conference? There is a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0486"/>
<col>963</col>
vulgar but very effective phrase about a man who had "bitten off more than he could chew." I am inclined to think that it did occur to some of the leading members of the Government that in the scheme of the Parliament Bill they had gone somewhat further than they could get general support for, and that it was desirable to consider what modification could be entertained. If the Parliament Bill is a thing that cannot be touched, if it is a thing that must be taken as it stands without any change in principle and with no real change in any leading feature or detail of it, how can the invitation given by the Prime Minister to members of the Opposition to meet him in conference be explained? The Prime Minister must, by asking them to come into conference, have practically confessed that sonic little abatement of his own scheme was possible. It is no use asking an enemy to confer with you about a proposed plan if you have made up your mind that your plan is absolutely unalterable and cannot be modified in any single detail.<lb/>
When Mr. Asquith invited the Opposition to come into conference he must have felt that he was confessing that some alteration was possible even if it was not desirable. I say that must have been in his mind, and he did this, or, at all events, the Government did this, absolutely on their own initiative. I do not think it had been proposed in any quarter before they gave the invitation&#x2014;certainly the Opposition did not ask to be invited&#x2014;and although Mr. Asquith is rightly claiming that the setting up of the Conference was generally approved after it was constituted, I do not think there was anything like a popular or even an appreciable demand for its being set up before it was set up. Well, that is the attitude which the existence of the Conference must be held to betray on the part of the Government. But, of course, there is a correlative attitude on the part of the Opposition when they came into the Conference. They must be held also to have thought that there was a possibility of coating to some agreement, or they would not have agreed to confer. There must have been some departure from the attitude of stiff repugnance, some falling away from the attitude of <i>non possumus</i>. Whether they had the scheme which has now been put on the Table by the noble Marquess opposite fully conceived and in their own minds or
<col>964</col>
not, I do not know; but when they were ready to come into conference they must have been ready to confer and to agree about something; they must, therefore, have had sonic idea of meeting the Government in some way or other and of something or other coming out of it.<lb/>
The Conference was a novelty in our Parliamentary experience, and I am not quite sure that our experience of it will lead us to desire it to be repeated. We are in a state of very great difficulty in consequence of its having been held and having broken up without anything being known about what happened. How can there be any fruitful discussion in the country; how can the issues be properly placed before the electors; how can writers and speakers endeavour to make plain the issues before the nation when they do not know precisely the issues which divided the two Parties at that Conference? I confess I have a strong opinion that there ought to have been made public, not all its discussions, not all that was proposed or suggested, but at least what was the irreducible minimum of the one side and. the inexpansible maximum of the other. What was the difference which they were unable to bridge over and which caused the Conference to he abandoned? Did the Opposition refuse to consider the Bill unless subject to modification? Did the Government refuse to consider any modification? Did the Opposition members of the Conference bring forward the scheme of the noble Marquess opposite? Did the members of the Government declare that it was absolutely inadmissible? Many days were occupied; many things must have been said; there could not have been any clear issue at first; there must have been an approximation on one side arid the other, and we ought to know what degree of approximation was really reached. I had good reasons myself for believing that it would be necessary&#x2014;and I think it will be necessary&#x2014;in some way or other to modify the Parliament Bill before it became law, and we would like to know whether any modifications were suggested.<lb/>
The alternative of Joint Sittings is, of course, a complete change. It may have been proposed at the Conference, and, if so, it must have been proposed pretty early and Joint Sittings must have been considered. I hen must have come the question of how they were to be held. A
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0487"/>
<col>965</col>
Joint Sitting as a scheme for the solution of the difficulty is one which primarily commends itself to many minds. The noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal confessed that he liked the idea. Joint Sittings as a solution of difficulties between two branches of the Legislature exists, as we know, in Australia. It exists also under the new Constitution of South Africa, for which the noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal is in some measure responsible; so that he has a double reason for looking kindly on the suggestion of Joint Sittings. But, of course, as has been pointed out again and again, the acceptance of the idea of Joint Sittings really depends upon numbers. It is quite true that a joint sitting of the present House of Commons and the House of Lords reduced even to 300 members would be impossible. You can have no real consideration of questions arising in an assembly of that kind; and if you are going to create delegations or committees to which questions in difference should be referred, you will enter upon a scheme of very elaborate and very difficult legislation. If you are going to construct those committees by any permanent plan or scheme, the composition of the committees, the conditions under which they will sit, the force to be attached to their conclusions, whether they should be referred back to the original Houses which delegated powers to them, are all questions that will have to be considered. All these very grave questions are not touched upon in the Resolutions put before us by the noble Marquess opposite, and the absence of these details makes it, I think, impossible for us to say Aye or No or form any kind of favourable opinion of the Resolutions. If you arc going to the country with the alternative scheme of Joint Sittings, which has so much to recommend it, then you must put before the country a scheme which shall he workable without the complete reconstruction of our Parliamentary machine, without the separation of different classes of laws into two or three categories, and without the construction of permanent committees to which differences of opinion could be referred. You must at least put forward a scheme which will be apprehended by the nation. At present the scheme of the noble Marquess is sadly lacking in all these respects.<lb/>
There remains, my Lords, the proposal which is put forward in the Resolutions
<col>966</col>
of the noble Marquess and which may be considered as a possible modification of the Parliament Bill or of any other scheme&#x2014;I mean the proposal of the Referendum. If your Lordships will allow me, I should like to devote a few words&#x2014;and I will make them as few as possible&#x2014;to the question of the adoption of the Referendum as a means of settling differences between the two Houses, or as a means of correcting mis-legislation agreed upon by both Houses. The noble Marquess opposite, though there is nothing of that kind in his Resolutions, declared that he intended that the Referendum should be capable of being invoked in order to prevent legislation being passed which was not approved by the nation. There is, as I have said, nothing of that kind in the Resolutions as they stand, but no doubt it could be introduced into them. Let me say, in passing, that it does not necessarily follow, as my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor seemed to imply, that in that case it would be necessary to go outside Parliament to get authority to cause the reference to be made. It is not necessary to get an outside authority to say, "You two Houses have passed a law which we believe the country does not approve of, and we demand that that law should be put to a popular vote in order that the approval of the nation should be tested." That, as your Lordships know, is in operation in Switzerland, but it is quite an unnecessary part of the scheme that outside authority should be invoked to bring that power into effect. It could be clone by enabling the minority in either House who oppose the Bill, if of adequate proportions, to claim a Referendum in order to determine whether the legislation was or was not in accordance with the popular will.<lb/>
Take, for example, the Education Act of 1902, which is now frankly confessed by almost all Parties to have over-reached the national will. I do not wish to use the word in an antagonistic way, but it went beyond what the national will had determined upon, and it went beyond what the national will, if appealed to, would have approved. If a Referendum could have been invoked by a minority of the House of Commons opposing that Act, it could have been referred to the people and much mischief would have been saved by such a reference. That is a. way in which the Referendum could be worked even when both Houses concurred in
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0488"/>
<col>967</col>
passing an Act which was opposed to the popular will. But the Referendum is not usually talked of in that way; it is more usually talked of as a way of reconciling differences between the two Houses and ascertaining which more correctly interprets the will of the nation; and it might be added on as a qualification under certain conditions of the operation of the Parliament Bill that, despite the provisions already contained in that Bill, an Act so approved should not become law, if an appeal were made by a sufficient number of backers, until the will of the nation had been taken on the issue. There are, no doubt, difficulties with regard to a Referendum, and those difficulties would have to be faced and considered. Referendum must, in my opinion, be a costly matter; it must cost money and it must cost time. Suppose you refer to the will of the nation to determine a particular question. I pass over the difficulty of ascertaining what the question is that is to be referred, and I assume that the question is already settled. But how are you going to obtain the will of the electors?<lb/>
Is it conceivable that you could send by post letters to the electors containing the question and asking them to return it by post? That is, of course, quite inconceivable. You could not ensure that the answers that so came back were the free expressions of the will of the persons from whom they came. You could not even ensure that they came from them at all. The answers must in some way be verified; they must be answers made by those who are entitled to speak; there must be some proof of the identity of the person filling up the form. In fact, there must be some such local machinery as exists now when a poll is taken, in order in some way or other to secure the secrecy of the ballot to the elector, in order to verify the personality of the elector, and in order to ensure that he is acting free from coercion, free from bribe, and free from any power which should not be allowed to influence him in the exercise of his will. You must have booths to which the voter can go and vote, as now, before some officer appointed for that purpose. You would not have candidates necessarily, and you would not have meetings necessarily, or so much expense as is now incurred, but a good deal of that expense is voluntary, and the question arises whether it would not become almost as
<col>968</col>
essential, although voluntary, in the future as it is at the present time. Suppose that such a question as that of Women's Suffrage was put, as the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack suggested, by Referendum before the people. The electors would be asked to go and give their opinion for or against in the polling booths on a particular day. The opponents, I suppose, would be eager in bringing up those who would say No, and the promoters of the Bill would be eager in bringing up those who would say Yes. The literature on the subject would be unbounded, the meetings would be pretty numerous, and there would be a considerable expense&#x2014;not perhaps two millions, but a very considerable expense in order to secure the vote on that question. There are other questions exciting still greater interest in which the expense would be more considerable, and in which there would be the same passion and energy, the same expenditure of labour and money, or pretty nearly as much, as is now spent on a General Election. Take, for instance, the question of Welsh Disestablishment. Consider the energy that would be displayed in bringing the electors to vote on that question.<lb/>
Then consider a tariff. The noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal said yesterday that it would be impossible to refer a tariff to a Referendum. He used this as an argument against a Referendum. I do not quite know what he had in his mind when he talked of referring a tariff to a Referendum. Perhaps he thought of referring, article by article, the duty proposed to be charged to the approbation of the electors. In that case I confess it would be quite impossible, but in a more general way it is not only possible to refer a tariff to a Referendum but the thing has been done. In 1891 Switzerland made a radical change in the character of its tariff. The two branches of the Swiss Parliament agreed upon a new general tariff. The dissonants claimed a reference to the people at large. In the case of Switzerland the dissonants speak from outside and not from inside the Chamber, and the tariff so put to the people at large was approved, I am sorry to say, because it was a Protectionist tariff differing from the Free Trade policy of Switzerland. It was approved by a very large vote. That is an illustration of the way in which a tariff has been put to the vote by means
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0489"/>
<col>969</col>
of a Referendum. Now just conceive the amount of money that would he spent on a Referendum with regard to a tariff in this country&#x2014;the interests involved, the excitement occasioned, the meetings up and down the country. Candidates might not be necessarily required to join in them, but I think they would, and the cost would clearly be very considerable.<lb/>
Switzerland herself has given us her experience of a Referendum which did involve pecuniary interests, and which led to a considerable expenditure of money and of time and labour. In Switzerland as your Lordships know, the railways have largely become nationalised. A law was passed by the Swiss Legislature in 1891, I think it was, which proposed to take over the Central Railway of Switzerland by the nation. The dissonants called for a Referendum; it was referred to the people, and the people negatived the Bill though it had passed both Houses in the Swiss Legislature. Some ten years afterwards a more general Bill was brought in for taking over practically all the railways of Switzerland. It again passed both branches of the Legislature; again a claim was made to refer it to the people; and this time the people by a. huge majority, more than two to one, affirmed the Bill. But on the second occasion, as no doubt on the first also, there was an enormous and profuse expenditure of money on literature, placards, meetings, and so forth. Railway interests were stirred up, and they did all they could to influence public opinion against the proposal by means of newspapers, journals, and pamphlets. On the other hand, those who wanted to nationalise the railways used the same exertions on their side. The expenditure of money was considerable, and if the Referendum were adopted in this country I cannot conceive but that it would be an expensive operation considering, the interests involved and the ardour with which such questions are agitated on both sides. But there is no difficulty in the way a machinery in carrying it out, and I think there is little or no difficulty in the way of principle. The Referendum is democratic to the last degree, but it is expensive and would involve practically the same trouble as a General Election.<lb/>
It is said also that the principle of the Referendum would take away from
<col>970</col>
the character of the House of Commons and from the authority of Ministers. As to the authority of Ministers, I confess that objection is to my mind a recommendation. I want to have the authority of Ministers in this country diminished. I want to see their power abated. They have obtained through the evolution a our wrongful Parliamentary system a power which may not last, but which, while it lasts, is to be deprecated. As to the members of the House of Commons generally, I do not believe for one moment that the introduction of a system of Referendum would take away from the authority of those members. It would rather stimulate them, and if that further reform in the mode of election to the House of Commons to which I have referred were adopted, you would get a House of Commons re-invigorated, with fresh power, fresh authority, and fresh influence. Ministers would not have the same power, but you would bring back in the House of Commons the old forms of counsel and of consultation, the old spirit which did animate it in past days when it was really a House of deliberation and not merely a House of registration.<lb/>
I think that this matter of the Referendum deserves the fullest consideration, and with sufficient safeguards it seems to me a thing that we might wisely adopt. It is simple, as I have said, and it is recommended by its adoption by the most democratic communities in the world. Switzerland has long had it in operation. The Referendum is in use in Natal, and it was used with reference to the South Africa Bill. The Referendum is in use in Australia, and was applied in reference to almost every stage of the Commonwealth Act. It is now in use, or will be very shortly, in Australia with regard to the respective changes in the constitution of the Commonwealth. At this very moment two Bills have passed the Australian Legislature&#x2014;one for altering the relations between the Commonwealth and the States in respect of money contributions, and the other for enlarging the power of the Legislature in respect of industrial enterprise&#x2014;which require to be approved by a Referendum before they can become law. These two Acts have both been passed by the Australian Legislature, and both will be referred in due time to the electors. In the United States the Referendum is not in operation in
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0490"/>
<col>971</col>
respect to Federal matters, but it has been adopted again and again in State elections and with respect to legislation in States and the policy to be pursued within the respective States, and those who have taken the trouble to consult the latest edition of Mr. Bryce's book on the American Commonwealth will find a paragraph in which there is the most clear approval expressed by him of the operation of the Referendum in the States of America as enabling the electors of the different States to correct the crazes of legislators from time to time. This is the deliberate expression of opinion on the part of Mr. Bryce in reference to this matter. While the Referendum is open to the objection which I have not hesitated to state of time and money, it might be recommended for adoption in our Parliamentary system as auxiliary, perhaps, to Parliament, or as supplementary to Joint Sittings, but anyhow as a means of bringing the mind of the nation into its fullest influence and power in directing the legislation of the country.<lb/>
My Lords, I apologise for occupying your attention so long, but I cannot conclude without again expressing my conviction that this problem of the reconciliation of the two Houses and the deeper problem which underlies that reconciliation &#x2014;namely, the problem of making legislation the true exposition of the will of the people&#x2014;can never he solved except by undertaking a radical reform of the mode of election of the House of Commons. That cannot he done, primarily, here; but if you will lend your influence to support movements elsewhere and in the House of Commons itself to make the House of Commons a real reflection of the mind of the nation in its different phases, its different modes of thought, its different appreciation of different questions, you will establish in the House of Commons a power so great that you would never dream of resisting its conclusions in this House, and there would be profound satisfaction on the part of the nation at large at the way in which it conducted its work. It was said by an old poet&#x2014;it dwells in my mind because Mr. John Bright quoted it many years ago in one of his speeches&#x2014;
<quote>"There is on earth a yet auguster thing,
Veiled though it be, than Parliament or King."</quote>
There is in this nation of ours something more august than Parliament or either,
<col>972</col>
House of Parliament&#x2014;the will and conscience of the nation at large. That is what we are all trying to get at; that is what we are all seeking to ascertain. It is that to which we should all give effect in our legislation, but in order to do that you must reform the House of Commons itself, which is the real heart of the nation. In that reform, and in that alone, lies the first step towards the necessary reconciliation of the two Houses and the inauguration of a true Legislature representing the will of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02357"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRASSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am at all times most reluctant to trouble your Lordships and especially so in the circumstances of the hour to-night. My words, therefore, shall be very few. I have had a long Parliamentary experience. Fifty years have elapsed since I first stood as a candidate for Birkenhead. I have seen many changes during that time. They have always been viewed with the direst apprehension, but my experience has shown that those apprehensions have not been warranted. To-day we are considering the Parliament Bill, in which is embodied the plan originally prepared by my lamented friend, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and I desire to say that I am entirely in accord with the Government. We are all agreed that constitutional changes cannot endure unless by accord, and it is satisfactory to know that we have gone a considerable way along the road of agreement. Since the Bill was first introduced the noble Marquess has made further proposals, and I am bound to say that I view not unfavourably the proposal for a Referendum in regard to any grave matter. I fully appreciate the objections which were so ably urged by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, but the fact remains that it is vain to look to a General Election as a test of popular opinion. At the last General Election I made diligent inquiries in the various parts of the country in which I have interests, and I failed to elicit from the most experienced election agents any opinion as to what had really guided the electors in the votes that were cast. To-day the Prime Minister has said that at the coming election the sole issue is the Veto of your Lordships' House. But we are hearing on the one hand that the only issue is resistance to the Food Tax, and on the other hand resistance to Home Rule. I do most earnestly hope that the coming election is the last in which
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0491"/>
<col>973</col>
attempts will be made to make political capital by stirring up hostility to Ireland. We are all influenced by our experiences; and having led a Jubilee procession two and a-half miles long through the streets of Melbourne with thousands of Irishmen wearing green scarves anxious to testify their love and reverence for their Queen, I cannot but attach strong faith to local self-government as a healer of differences.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02359"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COLCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not surprised at the failure of the Conference, being convinced, from the action taken by His Majesty's Government, that no settlement could be arrived at on the lines proposed. They say there is much from which they cannot recede, and there is much which cannot possibly be accepted from this side of the House. I think, therefore, that no arrangement could possibly have been arrived at except by means of concessions which would have been at the expense of the whole Unionist Party. The proposed change, practically to substitute one Chamber and to abolish the powers of this House, is the most momentous change in the Constitution which has been proposed for generations. I say this in spite of the minimizing speech of the noble Earl the Leader of the House. He has truly stated that the Government Bill provides for delay and discussion, but that does not suffice to remove all dangers of hasty and arbitrary legislation. Delay and discussion might avail between two bodies vested with equal powers, but otherwise one House might feel that, although it enforced Amendments, it would be at the mercy of the other House, who before the end of that Parliament would insist upon passing the whole Bill under consideration unaltered.<lb/>
I was reminded of the phrase of a great writer, "Persuasion is the resource of the feeble, and the feeble can seldom persuade." This House would be feeble if it had to go into discussions with the other House of Parliament while having no power of rejecting the whole or any part of a Bill. I think at the same time that the sting of the proposal is in the suggestion that this could be done in the duration of "one Parliament." If it had been possible to have substituted "two Parliaments" I think it would have been
<col>974</col>
very much improved, and I do not believe it would have made any very great difference as compared with the present procedure, because this House is not usually in the habit of rejecting Bills which are passed by a substantial majority in two successive Houses of Commons. I think it ought to be necessary that the majority in both cases should be a substantial one, and not one reduced to such a point as to show that the opinion of the country had changed.<lb/>
It is said that when the Conservative Party are in power there is no quarrel between the two Houses. I have been a member of this House a good many years, and I remember a Bill which had to do with the purchase and registration of titles, but which included clauses abolishing primogeniture in cases of intestacy. At that time the Bill was riot absolutely rejected, but certain clauses were struck out. I remember it well, because I voted against it myself, and the 'Bill was withdrawn by the Government. That was one case where a Bill of a Conservative Government was not passed by this House. It is therefore not true to say that when a Conservative Government is in power this House does not assert its independence. You may also remember that in 1867 Lord Cairns carried an Amendment (establishing minority representation in three-Member constituencies) to the Reform Bill against both Front Benches. The Government accepted the Amendment in the House of Commons, and it remained the law for a good many years. There were two or three other cases, such as a Poor Law Bill which was amended by a number of independent Peers interested in Poor Law management. That was in the time of Lord Beaconsfield, but what the effect of that clause was I do not remember. If it were possible to substitute two Parliaments for one I cannot see why we should not be in agreement on this matter, but I do attach importance to the majority being in some way fixed, and also to the question of the Referendum.<lb/>
I cannot help thinking that some noble Lords opposite, when they speak of the Referendum, do no realise the extent to which they have gone with that doctrine. They use arguments against the Referendum, but those are arguments, if not against all popular government, certainly against democratic supremacy. We are told that the people would not understand
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0492"/>
<col>975</col>
the Referendum, but the change proposed would simply mean that the direct will of the people would be ascertained without the interposition of the representatives. I do not see why, having gone as far as we have gone, the Government should object to it. I cannot understand the grounds on which the Government appear to shrink from the Referendum. It is important to provide against the use of power arbitrarily. In some cases a momentary majority is likely to have more power than a substantial majority. If the will of the other House is to prevail in the duration of one Parliament, then that is an arbitrary power which you will not find in any other Constitution in the world. The great men who founded the Constitution of the United States provided checks which they considered necessary to secure separate powers to each Chamber. In England we have always had a balance between the various elements. There has not been single and undivided power. I believe single and undivided power to be dangerous. In the proposals which have been brought forward we are asked to set up for the first time an arbitrary power. Against the setting up of that power I feel bound to protest, and I trust its mischief and its perils will not escape the attention and the judgment of the English nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02360"><member>LORD NUNBURNHOLME</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess, as a supporter of His Majesty's Government, that I was considerably surprised when the Resolutions now before the House were put forward in preference to the Parliament Bill which we have been authorised by the country to put before your Lordships. I think I am right in saying that this Bill has been considered in another place. When I was in that place I remember Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman bringing in Resolutions which foreshadowed this Parliament Bill. They were approved by the House of Commons of that day. They are approved by the present House of Commons, and since they were first brought into Parliament we have had a General Election. They have been spoken of on the platforms up and down the country, and no one can really say that this measure has been sprung upon the House.<lb/>
My Lords, what is at stake? As far as I can see, it is this. You have on the one side a Bill which will give some chance of Liberal measures becoming law. I
<col>976</col>
regret myself that the Parliament Bill is so very mild. If a Bill has to come up three times in one Parliament, ample facilities are given for revision and conference during that time. I should have thought, my Lords, that this might almost have been rolled a Conservative measure. But I think the country will see through these Resolutions, which have been tabled to draw away the gaze of the country from the true object of this election. In the part of the country from which I come the people are determined to pot an end to the present state of affairs. They do not wish to have a House of Lords which will be stronger under these Resolutions than it has been before. Under these Resolutions the Liberal Party will have no more power or no more chance than at present of passing their measures into law; in fact, their position will be rather worse.<lb/>
Whenever one of our Bills comes up from another place and your Lordships do not like it, you will ask for a conference. The chances are that in that conference the Government members of this House will be no more in number than noble Lords opposite. I do not think that anything will come from such a conference. The end of it will be that everything the Opposition does not like will be referred to the Referendum. It is the same thing as the last Budget over again. Your Lordships threw out that Budget. We went to the country on the Budget, and you then gave way and passed it. Well, I suppose that will happen every time a great, Liberal measure conies up from another place. You will refer it to the country, and then, if the electors approve of it, it will be finally passed into law. But is not this rather a cumbersome way of doing business? I do not think the country will stand your Lordships' view. I hope the country will give its support to the Bill of His Majesty's Government, which is the only measure that will give the Liberal Party a fair chance of passing into law their Bills for the advancement and welfare of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02361"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it seems to me that if there is one feature in this debate more outstanding than another it is that no adequate reason has as yet been given, either by the Government or any of the speakers, for the position into which the country has been suddenly plunged. No adequate reason has been
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0493"/>
<col>977</col>
given to us why because of the failure of the Conference this sudden Dissolution should have been announced. That this is the one outstanding question which has interested the House is proved by the fact that it was the one to which the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack directed his attention and a great part of his speech. Whether lie successfully solved it or gave vow. Lordships a satisfactory answer is a. I different question, and one on which I want so say a few words. The noble and learned Lord was very impressive as to the gravity of the position and the seriousness of the Constitutional questions which have to be solved. I wish that at the next Cabinet Council he would impress upon some of his colleagues that if there are serious Constitutional questions to be solved it would be desirable that their speeches in the country should be directed toward them.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord said that there were two questions; first, why the Government had advised a Dissolution, and, the second, what was the Constitutional effect of the Resolutions proposed by Lord Lansdowne. As to the first he gave us a somewhat lengthy parenthesis about Home Rule. He denied that the idea of bringing in Home Rule was the object of the Dissolution. I am perfectly certain that there is no one of your Lordships who will refuse to accept in the most wholehearted way a declaration made with that solemnity and authority from the Woolsack. Whether there may not be a difference between the object and the result is a question to which. I shall address myself in a few moments. But the noble and learned Lord went on to say that the real necessity for the Dissolution was to bring to an issue what he described as the irreconcilable differences between the two Parties on the problems before us, and he quoted Mr. Balfour's speech at Nottingham as proving how irreconcilable those differences were. I want to ask this question&#x2014;if the differences are irreconcilable now, were they or were they not irreconcilable last May? What has brought about the change? Why did it take twenty-one meetings and four or five months' deliberation to find out that the differences were irreconcilable if they were irreconcilable all that time? That is a plain, straightforward, simple question, but to it we have never had the semblance of an answer either in this House or the other.<lb/>
<col>978</col>
The other point to which the noble and learned Lord addressed himself was&#x2014;I think I am not misrepresenting him&#x2014;that lie made it a grievance that up to quite a recent date nothing had been placed before this House as to the relative powers of the two Houses of Parliament, and he implied&#x2014;I do not think lie exactly used the words&#x2014;that we were only repenting upon our deathbed. I venture to say that there is not a noble Lard on this side of the House who will deny or who has ever denied the importance of the twofold questions of the Constitution and the relative powers of the two Houses. Bat I ask the noble and learned Lord bow and when, in the circumstances in which this House has been placed, we could have tabled our proposals before now. There were the Veto Resolutions in the other House of Parliament, which we were promised would be embodied in a Bill to be presented, I think, fist to that House, but at any rate to this House. The proper, regular, Constitutional position of this House was to wait until the proposals of the Government as to the powers as between the two Chambers were presented to this House before we made our proposals. It was absolutely impossible, however strongly we might feel, at any time in May or the following months or at any time before very recent days to table anything of the kind. I ventured to hope that the Conference might have a chance of solving some of those difficulties, or at all events might narrow the issue, might give a chance, when the result of the Conference was made known to us for moderate, Constitutional, sensible opinion to settle this controversy without all this difficulty and this appeal to popular feeling. It was out of respect to the Conference and to His Majesty's Government that none of us made any move at that time, because we hoped that the Conference would not fail. I think those of us on whom, to some extent at any rate, extreme Party ties sit lightly have in this matter of great importance a. grievance that we have been kept wholly in ignorance. Surely the mere fact that these discussions have taken place, surely the very admissions from the Front Bench opposite during these discussions show that if a different and a wiser course had been taken we might have got nearer to a settlement without all these appeals to popular passions and without a General Election.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0494"/>
<col>979</col>
As I understand it, there have always been two grievances which are strongly felt by the Radical Party&#x2014;first, as to the constitution of this House, and, second, as to the powers of the House. I think during recent times we on this side of the House have proved that we are open to fair consideration of both those points. As to reform of the constitution, it is largely owing to the action of His Majesty's Government and their supporters that so little progress has been made in the matter. They boycotted the Committee; they have never given us officially the slightest help, and it has been obvious that the object of the great body of their supporters in the other House was not to reform the constitution of this House but to keep it upon its hereditary basis in order that they might make it an object of indignation and declamation throughout the country. We have again and again been willing to reform the constitution of this House, but we have never had the slightest encouragement from the Radical Party, either officially or unofficially, in the matter.<lb/>
In my humble opinion the real problem which we have to solve consists of two parts. What we have to endeavour to do is to get a fair balance of power between the two Parties in the Second Chamber, whatever its constitution may be, and at the same time to preserve a reasonable and proper amount of independence in the Second House of Parliament. I say without fear of contradiction that the plan of the Government does not even attempt to find a solution of the first of those points. It proposes to make no change in the constitution of this House; and so far as the second point is concerned, the reservation of a reasonable amount of independence is absolutely killed if the Parliament Bill were to become law.<lb/>
I venture to say that the object of those who favour the Parliament Bill as it stands is to grasp absolutely unlimited power for the House of Commons; That, in my humble opinion, is the fatal defect of the Bill as it stands. It abolishes all control, even that of the electorate, for the first three years of a new House of Commons. The Lord Chancellor pointed out most truly that the theory of our Constitution is that there is no independent and uncontrolled power in any part of it. The House of Commons is controlled by Disso-
<col>980</col>
lution, the House of Lords by the possible creation of Peers, and the Crown by the possibility of a refusal of Supplies. If this Bill were to pass there would be no power of control left over the House of Commons. The power of Dissolution would have disappeared. There would be no check, in the first place, upon legislation, and there would be no power of Dissolution, because it is the Government which recommends the Sovereign to dissolve Parliament; and if the House of Commons is to have power under the Parliament Bill for three years it is obvious that during those three years no advice to dissolve Parliament will be given. Therefore, whatever the scheme may be, however wild, however Radical, it would he legally&#x2014;I emphasize that word&#x2014; in the power of the first House of Parliament to legislate without control.<lb/>
Within those three years there is, so far as legal check is concerned, nothing which the House of Commons could not do. I am not going too far when I say that during three sessions and those two years they might abolish the Monarchy; they might bring in Home Rule. I am not afraid of their attempting to abolish the Monarchy; but I say fearlessly that it is not right that, even in theory, it should be legally in their power to do such a thing. It would be legally in their power to bring in a scheme of Home Rule. It might not be, and I accept the assurance of the Lord Chancellor that it is not their object, but it is a result which is hoped for by some of their supporters. I need not make more than one quotation. Mr. T. P. O'Connor is reported in to-day's newspapers as having said that a Liberal majority would bring the present House of Lords to an end, and then he adds&#x2014;
<quote>"When that happens the last obstacle to Home Rule will be removed."</quote>
That may not be the object with which this Parliament Bill is produced and for which these new powers are sought, but I say it is a result that may be brought about, and it is that result against some of us, at any rate, desire to guard. The noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture was very eloquent about the amount of delay, and I think it was mentioned by the noble Lord who spoke last, whom I welcome as the first of the independent supporters of His Majesty's Government who has said a good word either for them or for their scheme.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0495"/>
<col>981</col>
But what does this delay of three years amount to? A Bill is to be passed in the first session of Parliament. Then after certain intervals of time it is to be passed a second and a third time. Do you really think in these days, when Party spirit is roused, when men's blood is up, when, as I say with regret, a large amount of independence is taken away from the private members of the House of Commons, that any body of private members of the House of Commons will dare to separate themselves from their Government when the question at issue is one of contest between the House to which they belong, to which they are loyal, to which they are proud to belong, and the other House of Parliament? I can only say that these two or three sessions are an absolutely delusive security. I do not think it is worth anything, because I do not believe it is possible in these days on an important matter that men will be detached from their Party in sufficient numbers to change the issue.<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke last says there would be an opportunity for discussion and amendment, but, as 1 understand&#x2014;I may be wrong&#x2014;if there is a single word amended it is not the same Bill, and therefore there would be no use in sending it up under the procedure of this Bill. It would not be certified to be the same Bill unless it corresponded in every respect, except in such matters as dates and things of that sort. Therefore if you have discussion, and you can have no change which is worthy of the name, a change to be brought about by argument, it is absolutely delusive and shows how little those who make this statement have really considered the matter. I venture to say there is really no safeguard for anything, however fundamental, be it Constitutional or financial or any other matter, in the proposals of the Parliament Bill. I lay it down without fear of contradiction that if you are to have an efficient working between the two Houses you must keep somewhere some power in reserve and you must not be deliberately bound hand and foot to the discretion of a Government and of one House of Parliament.<lb/>
I confess I look with hope, perhaps with greater hope than in any other direction, to a recourse to the Referendum. This matter is no new one on my part. As your Lordships know, I have had a Notice on
<col>982</col>
the Paper&#x2014;which I would have brought forward had a suitable occasion been presented&#x2014;since the month of May to raise an abstract discussion upon this point. Here I am really on common ground with noble Lords opposite. What we all profess to want is the real opinion of the nation. We want it on any question, and we want it as far as we possibly can get it disentangled from every other issue. We want it because, I say it with regret but I am afraid it is true, the other House of Parliament is not nearly so representative in the truest and best sense as it used to be. It is less an assembly of judicial representatives and it is much more an assembly of delegates tied and bound than it used to be. It is said that this idea of a Referendum detracts and diminishes the idea of representative and responsible Government. In one sense that is true. But the point I want to make is that a combination of circumstances for which no one is wholly responsible, for which the other House is probably not even largely responsible, have robbed the House of Commons of much of its dignity and of its representative character. In the first place there was obstruction, which obliged those who wanted business to be managed in reasonable time to have recourse to the closure and the guillotine. Secondly, there is the great and increasing rigidity of Party discipline. There is also the fact that for the last five and twenty years we have been tied and bound to single-member constituencies.<lb/>
The effect of all these things taken together is that it is the opinion of the extreme men on both sides which tells and the opinion of the extreme men only. That is a fact so notorious&#x2014;it is a fact which every sound Statesman laments&#x2014;that I need not labour it. I speak of it in no sense other than that of regret and sorrow; but because it is the fact it makes it necessary that there should be a certain power of control either in a Second Chamber or in some means of reference to the people at large. There is a liability in all men to place the interest of Party before national interest, and in the House of Commons as at present constituted you have a machine which beyond all question overpowers the independent judgment of Members in a way which has never been the ease in our history before. It is on that ground, almost entirely, that I am one of those who look for some cure in the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0496"/>
<col>983</col>
direction of a direct appeal to the country. Various objections have been taken to it. Noble Lords have said that it will be too costly. That entirely depends on how often and with what seriousness it is resorted to. All those things are questions of detail and of arrangement. They do not touch the real principle which lies at the bottom of this matter&#x2014;that if you can get the control of the people in no other way then take it by Referendum rather than do without it altogether.<lb/>
I am quite aware that the Conservative dislikes this new scheme because it is a new idea and an invasion into the practice and theory of our Constitution. It is so, and it would probably involve us for the first time in something like a written Constitution. The Liberal or Radical is, I venture to say, afraid of this new idea from the sound belief, confirmed by the writings of many of them, that they would have greater difficulty in getting a clear majority for some of their measures than they have at the present time. The man w ho wants an extreme measure of temperance reform joins forces with the Home Ruler; the man who wants Woman Suffrage or anything of that kind is apt to join forces with those who want something else. Together they make a majority to return a Party to power which, if their particular proposals were put separately, they would fail to secure. I venture to say that that is a sound argument in favour of the proposal of the Referendum. It has been proved beyond all question in those places where it is at work that, so far from being a radical or revolutionary scheme, it tends to be conservative, to moderate progress, a ad to take care, which I think even noble Lords opposite say is right, that the real opinion of the people should be obtained. I do not believe you can ever have a General Election in this country on one single issue. The issues are always involved. You cannot help it. Cast your recollection back to the General Elections of 1895, of 1900, of 1906, or even of 1910, and in which of them will you say that the issue was single and undivided?<lb/>
I am not afraid of taking even the General Election of the early part of this year as a test. It proceeded upon the delay of the Budget by this House, a matter upon which I, at any rate, can speak with perfect impartiality, because I did not like it. But
<col>984</col>
it also proceeded upon the merits of the Budget itself, and to a certain extent upon proposed changes in our fiscal system. Noble Lords opposite say that it proved their case that this House was wrong in its judgment and action. But if that were so, why did they not proceed promptly to pass the Budget? At any rate, the fact remains that they did not do so. I do not know the reason. As a matter of fact I was not in the country at the time, and if I had I probably should not have been able to learn, but the fact is sufficient for me. If you wanted to discredit this House and to show how completely wrong it was in its action, then the thing to do would have been to pass the Budget at once by the acclamation of the representatives of the people. I still think with all respect that the action of this House was unwise, but if anything could justify it, it would be the fact that when you came back with a new Parliament you did not make the Budget the first thing to be dealt with. But my point is not that, but that even the 1910 Election shows what a satire it is to suppose that either in this great country or any other you can have elections upon one single issue and upon that alone.<lb/>
Now, whatever may be the defects of the Referendum, it has this one distinct and outstanding merit, that at any rate by proper organisation and careful control it can be made to put a straight, fair, and simple issue to the people at large. You go direct to the people. You can get them to declare their will upon a question carefully selected and adjusted for the purpose. It is common ground between all of us that the people at large are to manage their own affairs. They are the real Sovereign of the State, and the claim of those of us who desire to see the Referendum brought into operation is that they should be treated as you regard them, and that to them the supreme issue should be put. The root of the whole matter is this&#x2014;that the first object in view is to adopt some method of getting at the real will of the people and that as you go along will solve the difficulties and disagreements between the one House and the other. The Referendum will do that. This idea of the Referendum is an experiment without danger. It will raise a clear, distinct issue before the country. It is at once a democratic and conservative measure; it will control the extremities of Party organisations, it will preserve the country from the danger

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02362"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BIRMINGHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened to this debate with a good deal of astonishment, riot on account of the criticism which has been so generally administered to the proposals of His Majesty's Government, but much more at the unanimity of approval which has been given to the Resolutions of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition. The noble Earl the Leader of the House expressed the hope, natural in his position, that they would receive independent criticism, and I own that I have been astonished to see how very ready this House appears to be to commit the great Constitional Party, the Unionist or the Conservative Party, to the principle of the Referendum. It is to that only that I desire to address myself for a very few minutes.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, in a speech which he delivered a little while ago, said that the advantage of having these Resolutions before the House was that it would be known what were the principles upon which, if the Conservative Party were returned to power, they would proceed to deal with the difficulties of the situation; so I think I shall not be saying too much if I say that in passing these Resolutions to-night your Lordships' House will have committed itself to the principle of the Referendum, a principle which was truly described by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack as the principle of government by <i>plebiscite</i>. It is democratic undoubtedly. In a sense, it is the most democratic proposal which your Lordships could make; but I venture to think that it is a perversion of democracy. It is a principle which is fascinating when you look at it at a distance, but the more you contemplate the details the more you feel its difficulties and its tremendous perils.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Courtney, who addressed us just before dinner, spoke in a very thin House, and I venture to think it would have been well if your Lordships had in larger numbers heard what he said about the difficulties of applying the principle of the Referendum in practical polities. He spoke, for example, of the expense. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, ventured even to suggest that this was a matter which might
<col>986</col>
be transacted by post. Lord Courtney pointed out that if you are to have security as to the identity of the voter, and some care as to the absence of control in the giving of his vote, any such idea is utterly absurd; that is to say, you must have polling booths, so that there shall be security for the voter in giving his vote, uncontrolled by any other influence. Think of the actual proposal as it stands in the Resolutions of the noble Marquess&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that if the difference relates to a matter which is of great gravity, and has not been adequately submitted for the judgment of the people, it shall not be referred to the Joint Sitting, but shall be submitted for decision to the electors by Referendum."</quote>
If you consider what would be involved in the submission of a new question to the judgment of the electors, I fancy you will see that it would not be very much less than the apparatus of a General Election which would have to be brought to bear. I cannot conceive how it can be doubted, in a country like ours, that if you have time principle of the Referendum, it would have to be used more or less frequently, for it would be demanded in the case of any measure in regard to which there was a considerable minority. If I may compare a very small matter with the very great, I may say that in the Lower House of Convocation we have a rule that those who demand a poll should pay the expenses, and that is found to be a considerable deterrent in demanding a poll. But, my Lords, if the expense is to come out of the Exchequer, there would be no such deterrent. If you set up this principle of the Referendum, you cannot refuse to allow it to be applied to any important question for which there is a considerable minority, and the principle of the Referendum will, in consequence, be more or less constantly applied with enormous expense, and, as I say, with the whole practical apparatus and effect on the minds of the people of a General Election.<lb/>
Take another point. One noble Lord who spoke in this debate said, with regard to the Education Bill of 1902, that if there had been a Referendum acid an appeal had been made to the country the country would have rejected that measure. You may take that Education Bill or the later Education Bill, in which I had the pain of opposing His Majesty's Government; but think what it would have been to put the question with regard to either of those Education Bills. You could only have put the question as a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0498"/>
<col>987</col>
vote of confidence in the existing Government. The questions are so complicated and so large that you could not, otherwise narrow them down to a single issue. Another point of the greatest importance against, the Referendum which I have not, so much as heard alluded to in all this discussion is that it implies the swallowing up altogether of local representation and local influence. In our system of Government the representatives of Ireland, of Wales, or of agricultural districts, are allowed special weight in speaking about and discussing questions which concern their special needs. The Referendum would swallow up all this. This is one of the many points where there is an immense difference between our own country and Switzerland, where they have a system under which each canton is determined to preserve its local unity. It is a system which you may describe, roughly, as "Home Rule all round." But we start from a totally different basis; we start from a unified Government. If we are to have the principle of the Referendum it might rapidly lead to the application of the principle of "Home Rule all round." That might be an indirect but good result to be derived from the application of the principle of the Referendum.<lb/>
But I ask you, starting as we do from the principle of a unified Government, to realise that local feeling would be swallowed up. Take a matter which touches the feelings of the working classes, say, in such districts as Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire&#x2014;take the principle of half-time for scholars in our schools. There, I think, it would be certain that local feeling would be completely swallowed up in a vote of the whole country on this matter. Take, again, the case of Wales and Welsh Disestablishment, or, again, what touches agricultural interests. Local influence would be altogether swallowed up numerically by the votes of the dwellers in towns. I ask your Lordships to consider how this principle of the Referendum would swallow up at once the whole principle upon which in the House of Commons the representation of local interests is at present allowed the greatest weight. There is another class of question with regard to which the Referendum would have an effect which I venture to think is so perilous that it would be a most momentous thing if it were to be embarked upon. There is a very large series of questions touching the domestic and personal interests of the
<col>988</col>
working classes in regard to which reform is most necessary, but which would at the same time cost a great deal. With regard to this whole class of question, I think that if the interest of the working classes lies in choosing the best representatives they can, it is likely that their best representatives, their truest friends, will vote for these reforms and they will be peaceably carried. But it would be perilous to adopt the Referendum in regard to such matters as Sunday closing, obligatory military training, the extension of the requirements of education, all of which affect pockets, and the immediate domestic interests of the working classes, and I venture to ask those who know them best, those who are most interested in their welfare, whether it is not incomparably better that what should be asked of them is to vote for the men whom they think best qualified to serve their interests as a whole than to decide these particular questions one by one. I feel quite sure that there is a great class of questions, and these of most importance, with regard to which the average voter is reasonably qualified to elect a man whom he desires to represent lain, but with regard to which there will be a serious deterioration and drawback if he is requested to vote question by question on particular points. I can hardly conceive any one who knows the mind of the average man doubting that there is a vast difference between the capacity of a man to elect another to represent him and the capacity of a man to answer question by question and point by point.<lb/>
The Referendum seems to reach its maximum of inapplicability when matters of great gravity are concerned. Is it likely that a great and intricate Constitutional question, requiring for its adequate solution great and deep and complicated knowledge of history and precedent, not directly affecting the immediate personal interests of the great mass of the individuals who form the nation, can be satisfactorily decided by such means? It does seem to me that it was not an exaggeration when the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, said that this was really the abolition of representative Government and the principle of Ministerial responsibility. I know that you can press the principle of delegation to a point which does involve absolutely the Referendum, but I do not desire to press the principle of delegation to that point. I do not believe that it would be
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0499"/>
<col>989</col>
for the welfare of the country. I am not a prophet, and none of us can tell how this matter will work out, but I do believe, my Lords, that there is a vast number of questions, and these the most important, with regard to which all you can expect of the average elector is that he should elect the person who is best qualified to represent him, and with regard to which you cannot expect the average elector to be qualified to give a particular opinion "Yes" or "No" in reply to any question which you propose to him. I desire to retain the principle which has hitherto guided the welfare of the nation&#x2014;the principle that there should he elected responsible Members of Parliament, who, for a period not too long&#x2014;shall we say five years?&#x2014;shall act within their responsibility, and at the end of that term give an account of their conduct to those who have chosen them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02363"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACK-BITEN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I have never listened to a speech which seemed to me more opportune and to convey sounder and more cardinal truths than the speech which has just fallen from the right rev. Prelate. I have always thought von assume&#x2014;and it is a compliment, no doubt, that yon assume&#x2014;that all elections, whether by Referendum or otherwise, would be decided on the merits of questions. My reading of the history of this country in our own, or comparatively our own, day is not that at all. The choice of the electors is far more often than not given on grounds of trust or distrust in leaders, or persons who aspire to be leaders. I do not know whether the noble Viscount opposite will agree with me, but take the great election of 1868, whereby Mr. Gladstone became Prime Minister. Was that decided upon the Irish Church question? It was nominally. Of course, there was the issue, but it was really decided by the fact that the people during several years of his financial administration had acquired great confidence in him, and said, "He must now- let us see what lie can do." [VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN dissented.] The noble Viscount does not agree, but at all events that is my view, and I think most people would agree that the election of 1906 was also not half so much decided upon a series of questions as upon a revolt of feeling against the action of certain prominent men.<lb/>
All the points which the right rev. Prelate has put are points which the people
<col>990</col>
must decide locally, and they can only decide them in groups of questions by returning, as the right rev. Prelate has said, men in whom they have confidence and upon whom they place the general responsibility. T for my part have always repelled the doctrine of mandate. I say that the constituencies return Members to represent them in Parliament. They choose the best man they can, and if when the time comes he displeases them they show it. If he wants to keep his seat lie will trim his sails. If he does not, be will be turned out. Rut the whole principle upon which, in my view, Parliamentary government has flourished in England is that the representative is entrusted with full powers. The question put to the electors, no doubt, is a political question, but the object for them is to choose the men whom they think will most faithfully and intelligently carry out their wishes. I only make these observations because they seem to me to go to the root and heart of these discussions.<lb/>
I now presume to make an observation upon what fell from the most rev. Prelate the Archbishop of York last night. For so accomplished a disputant, I was rather surprised that lie found such fault with the Prime Minister for saying that we had now conic to war. "It is," said the most rev. Prelate, "an appeal to force when reason has failed." And he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is a poor compliment to the people of this country to treat a General Election as if it were a mere arbitrament of force."</quote>
I listened to him with great respect but I have not the faintest idea what arbitrament of force is being resorted to beyond the ordinary clash of argument which has been the glory of this country for hundreds of years. We have carried on our politics certainly for a good long time, for a couple of hundred years, by the very clash of argument. I therefore fail, with all respect, to see any point in that observation. It is perfectly obvious that what the Prime Minister meant when he said "We have now conic to a state of war" was that diplomacy having broken down it was necessary to take the field with all the armament of argument. Well, for my own part I have never cared to look, as the most rev. Prelate indicated, at our action to-night or in the election that is upon us as involving an issue between
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0500"/>
<col>991</col>
hereditary and democratic principles. My Lords, I am a theorist, but I detest the introduction of abstract principles into the great practical difficulties of this nation. I do not regard this as a conflict between hereditary and democratic principles. It is a practical question, affecting all the instruments and machinery of government.<lb/>
I am not going into statics and dynamics. I am going to look into the machinery and see whether it works smoothly and well, whether it is capable of improvement, and whether anybody has got definite and marked improvements to lay before us. Till within a few years we all of us regarded the machinery of government of this country&#x2014;though lots of us have quarrelled with this and that action on the part of your Lordships' House and said this House would have to be either mended or ended&#x2014;as the best machinery that the wit of man had ever devised, except&#x2014;and I hope your Lordships will not quarrel with me for making this exception because it is deep with me&#x2014;except in the case of Ireland, where British statesmanship is waterlogged and bankrupt. From that point of view we feel that we are in possession, or have been in possession, of a great national system of machinery. There have been many dangerous creakings, no doubt, especially latterly, 'out notwithstanding we have carried on with a success and continuity that has been the envy of all the countries of the world, except, possibly, the United States. Therefore I look, if the House would care to know&#x2014;I look, as the right rev. Prelate does, with amazement, and, if I were in a rhetorical mood, I should say that I was appalled, if you will forgive the word, at the levity with which, within the last year or two, you noble Lords who represent, and well represent, the Conservative forces and their principles in this country have thrown all this away. And you have not thought out, if you have thought at all, this thing which you call a plan. If you had thought out your substitute I for one would have listened, watched, studied with respect. But there has been no thinking out, and you have sacrificed, on the lead of my noble friend on the Cross Benches what I, if I&#x2014;I hope your Lordships will forgive the presumption&#x2014;had been a Conservative leader, would have cherished. A day in French history was called "the day of dupes." I shall not live long enough to read this page
<col>992</col>
in our recorded annals, but I wonder whether the proceedings in this House within the last two years, and especially within the last week, will not be registered as "the day of dupes."<lb/>
I come now to this debate. I believe I am the last speaker on this side. We all agree that the debate has been conducted with moderation, with good temper, and, I think, with a fair measure of mutual respect. A good deal has been said about what I call secondary topics, but let me say that nobody in this House has resorted to ignoble topics. There has been a great deal of talk about raising class prejudice. I dislike class prejudice, and I hope it is not arrogant and presumptuous to say so. I feel when I have the honour to address your Lordships' House that I am addressing a body which in all its instincts, its views of right and wrong, and national habit, is not in the least fundamentally distinct from those great audiences which for many years I addressed in the City of Newcastle-on-Tyne. There has been no feeling of class prejudice in my mind; but, my Lords, there is a worse thing than class prejudice, and that is race or national prejudice. We have not had much of it, in fact I may say almost none of it, here. Still is it not true that the cry which is going to be loudly invoked in this election, the Irish cry, depends upon race and national prejudice? Talk of class prejudice The classes will take care of themselves, I trust. The English working man in my view&#x2014;and I represented a great and important group of them for many years&#x2014;is not in the least a Phrygian with a red cap, though some of his fellows may talk in that vein.<lb/>
But the Irish case. Lord St. Aldwyn and I are the only two men now living, that, I think, ever lived, who were good enough, wise enough, prudent enought, twice to till the delectable office of Irish Secretary. We are the two survivors who may put that laurel wreath round our brows. I wondered when I was listening to the powerful speech of the noble Viscount last night, reminding me of days a long time ago when he used to speak, I do not say as ably, but certainly ably enough in the House of Commons&#x2014;I wondered whether be does not think now, after the twenty-four years that have gone since Mr. Gladstone and I proposed to relieve the Irish Members from attendance in Parliament, that, perhaps, he made a
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0501"/>
<col>993</col>
mistake and that Mr. Gladstone was right. But in 1886, the noble dream came to an end, and in 1893, I think, a Motion was made by my noble friend who sits on the Cross Benches for the Second Reading of the Home Rule Bill, and that, too, came to an end. But did anybody think that the Irish sphinx was going to gather up what were then her rags and leave you alone? I never thought so. I wonder whether the noble Viscount thought so?</membercontribution></p>

I only say that I entirely agree with my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor in thinking that you will do no real good until you have attempted to grapple with the Irish sphinx in an effective way worthy of the fame of British statesmanship.<lb/>
It distresses me to have to turn again, with an accent of remonstrance, to that illustrious Bench (pointing to the Episcopal Bench). Last night the most rev. Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury made a very distinct and definite statement&#x2014;namely, that he was startled and even staggered to learn that a Dissolution was immediately to take place without any opportunity to this House to discuss or to amend the proposals of the Government. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"That calamity was averted by the action of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition."</quote>
My Lords, <i>Hansard</i> is a Pagan authority, and, if I may say so, <i>Hansard</i> takes the same place in our controversies as volumes of the Fathers or of the Councils of the Churches take in more serious things, and if the most rev. Primate had been so wanting employment, which I am glad to think he was not, as to turn to <i>Hansard</i>, he would have found that that assertion was wholly without support. For what happened? I would not refer to it for a moment with the object of making a point against the most rev. Primate, but other noble Lords have used language with something like the some implication.<lb/>
What happened? The Prime Minister, in explaining the inevitable delay which
<col>994</col>
took place in making the statement that he had promised the House of Commons&#x2014;namely, from Tuesday, the 15th, to Friday, the 186&#x2014;pointed out that the Government had suffered severely by having to postpone the statement of their intentions. "Sir," lie said&#x2014;
<quote>"there has been no change of plan. I see it suggested that with the object of springing or rushing a Dissolution on the country in the course of a week or the next few days, it was our intention not to present our Budget again for the consideration of the House of Commons; that and the intention originally entertained by us has since been abandoned or modified in consequence of Some form of pressure, how and whence applied I do not know."</quote>
There was no change of plan, and I should like to read to the House the language of Mr. Balfour on, I think, the same day, November 18&#x2014;
<quote>"Everybody" [Mr. Balfour said) "dislikes the idea of two elections coming on one another, partly because a General Election is a disturbance to the trade of the country. I admit that that cannot be avoided. I agree it is almost certain that a General Election cannot be deferred for more than a relatively small number of weeks or months. That I grant."</quote>
Then may I beg noble Lords not again to think that we have rushed the election for objects of our own, when your Leader in. another place has told you that it was inevitable?<lb/>
To-night my noble friend Lord Courtney spoke of the Conference, and said he thought that some of the proceedings of the Conference or some of their conclusions ought to be set forth. I do not agree with my noble friend. How can you have a Conference&#x2014;and I, for one, do not despair of seeing others&#x2014;how can you have a Conference if the gentlemen concerned in it may not speak with perfect freedom? You could not speak in a Palace of Truth with the whole of the outside world being able to say, "Oh&#x0021;but you said so and so in the Conference." A Conference on these terms is an impossible thing and not worth holding.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02367"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I was not quite clear what my noble friend asked for; he so often asks for what cannot be granted. But about the Conference I only say this. The Conference was not a gathering of two sets of men negotiating in the clouds. Who we re they? They were four Party leaders on each side;
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0502"/>
<col>995</col>
and on this subject Mr. Balfour used straightforward language at Nottingham when he said that the Conference was an exchange of views with a definite object, and that the four men on each side thoroughly and sincerely shared the view of trying to find a solution on three or four points. Mr. Balfour said that if they had agreed upon the only terms upon which agreement was possible they would have been regarded, not as supporting, but as betraying their cause. Then what it comes to is this. They had left at the end of the Conference a remnant of topics, a. margin of topics, upon which they could not agree. The margin may seem a narrow one, and I suppose&#x2014;if it is not wrong to surmise it, for I am only surmising&#x2014;that the Resolutions which we have before us to-night represent where the disagreement came nearly to an end. I guess that. It is the natural conclusion. I do not say it is a narrow margin because it is narrow on paper. It is very narrow on paper, all this about Joint Sessions, special questions of special gravity, a Joint Committee to decide, and the Referendum&#x2014;I presume that is the margin of difference&#x2014;but though narrow on paper it goes tremendously deep and really comes to the very heart of the whole of this controversy.<lb/>
Lord Curzon found fault with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and thought he was rather uncharitable when he referred to noble Lords opposite and what their action would be when the time would come for them to choose representatives out of their hereditary body. I have always thought that in politics you are bound to suppose yourself wiser than your opponents, but that you a re very foolish if you think yourself more honest than they are. I have never doubted for a moment that noble Lords opposite, supposing the time came for them to vote for a certain number of noble Lords to sit in the Joint Session, would do the best they could. Yes, but then there was a passage used&#x2014;and you know that in politics business is business&#x2014;by Lord Lansdowne in 1906, I think on the Trades Disputes Bill, in which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They were passing through a period when it was necessary for the House of Lords to move with great caution; conflicts and troubles might be unavoidable; but let their Lordships, so far as they were able, be sure, if they were to join issue, that it was upon ground which was as favourable as possible "&#x2014;not to the country, but "to themselves."</quote>
<col>996</col>
In judging the aim of these proposals we cannot forget language of that sort. I do not blame Lord Lansdowne for a moment, but you are acting upon grounds as favourable as possible to yourselves.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, took up a curious position, one that makes me profoundly suspicious of any set of Resolutions which he originates or warmly supports. This was his language used on November 30 of last year&#x2014;
<quote>"Your surrender now would mean that nothing would stand in future between the people and the power of the House of Commons, winch, in other words, means the Government of the day."</quote>
Who wants to stand between the House of Commons and the people? The House of Commons are sent there by the people. With all respect to your Lordships, but putting it directly, Who are you that you should frame resolutions and measures to stand between the House of Commons and the people? They are representative. I have never denied the powerful elements of representation which exist in this House. I have never denied all that. On the contrary. But language of the kind used by Lord Lansdowne, and still more the language used by Lord Curzon, naturally makes me suspicious that you are going by these Resolutions, which are empty in themselves, but when you fill in the outlines you are going to do something or another that will stand between the people and the House of Commons. That is to say, under pretence&#x2014;I do not use the word harshly&#x2014;of reforming yourselves, you are going, not to revise the proceedings of, but to checkmate the House of Commons.<lb/>
Like the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, I was a great many years in the House of Commons, almost as many, I think, as he was, though different years. I take a pride in the House of Commons, and anybody who by language used in this House or outside on platforms does anything to discredit that great institution of government does no good service to the national and public life of this country. There is a great deal of cant talked now about the House of Commons, and I was rather surprised last night when in his powerful speech' the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. a little countenanced it. Lord. Curzon. I think, has never sat in a Cabinet. If lie had sat in a Cabinet, as he may do, he would know that all this talk of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister and so forth being
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0503"/>
<col>997</col>
indifferent to the House of Commons and sending decrees to be registered by the House of Commons is mere moonshine. Lord St. Aldwvn knows that. I have sat in four or five Cabinets, and I know that Ministers in the Cabinet are almost daily feeling the pulse of the House of Commons. I am sorry to be so autobiographical, but in the debate in 1882 I sat beside Mr. Gladstone and in the Home Rule Bill debate of 1893 also. Do you think Mr. Gladstone was not alive to any point that anybody raised, whether in a Tory quarter, or the Irish quarter, or the Parnellite quarter, or whatever it was I Every Minister, of course, listens to what is said by anybody who makes a point and applies his mind to do the best he can in dealing with it. Therefore I regard that as a perfect bit of cant.<lb/>
You say that the House of Commons does not discuss questions. That brings me for half a moment to your Lordships' own habit of discussing a serious question. You say you are affronted. The word "affront" and the word "outrage" has been applied to the Government's dealing with your Lordships about this business. I am only going to refer to one matter. I am not going through any recapitulation, because the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack referred to that. The House of Commons carefully discussed plural voting, which is a thing that affects them directly. The subject was before the country, to my knowledge, for a whole generation, but what did your Lordships do who deem it an affront and an outrage if you have not plenty of time for discussing projects in the clouds like this? What did your Lordships do? You gave to the discussion of the Plural Voting Bill two hours. It had been days in the House of Commons. You gave it two hours, and then you threw it out comfortably before dinner.<lb/>
I understand that Lord Hugh Cecil, a distinguished kinsman of the noble Marquess opposite, has a plan and has worked it out. According to this plan the House was to consist of three or four hundred members, and they were all to be nominated, I think, by the Prime Minister of the day. What was to happen to them ultimately I do not bear in mind, but that plan, I am told, was received with contumely and amusement even by his own friends in the House of Commons. I do
<col>998</col>
not care what Resolutions you propose or pass. What we want is a tangible plan. These Resolutions contain no plan. If I ask a builder to build me a house, he deposits some bricks and some scaffold poles on the ground, and perhaps shows me a drawing of a magnificent elevation, but I say "No; please give me your specifications." I want noble Lords opposite to give us the specifications. The whole of the details arc wanting. You say there is to be a Joint Session, but the relative number, the ratio of members, is the vital thing. All depends upon that, and you do not say a word about it. Then questions of special gravity are to be excluded from Joint Sessions. You do not say exactly how that Joint Committee, with the Speaker in the chair, is to decide whether or not a given question is of special gravity. You do not say how that Committee is to be constituted, and you do not point out one single element which is to be present in the, minds of the Committee when they ere deciding. It is all left vague, nebulous, and in the clouds. Let me say that this is a point which makes me share with the Bishop of Birmingham a feeling of amazement. I hope that whatever may happen no transfer will take place of the right of judgment as to what laws are or are not what is called organic.<lb/>
As to finance, this Committee is to decide when a Bill is a Money Bill and when it is not. Again, I say&#x2014;How is this Committee to be composed that has got this tremendous question to determine? How is it to be appointed? What are the points in a dubious Bill to guide them? All that is in the clouds. The noble Viscount last night said&#x2014;
<quote>"We cannot tell you; we have not gone into the matter of proportionate numbers."</quote>
But that is the matter. That is the vital matter. And then lie gave a reason which puzzles me enormously. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is impossible to deal with the question of proportion between the Houses until we know how this House is to be constituted."</quote>
I cannot for the life of me make out what sort of changes he can be contemplating or thinking of as possible in this House which will make any difference as to the ratio which ought to exist between the numbers of this House and the number that ought to he sent from the other House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02369"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Yes; but I do not see what the composition of this House has to do with that.

I only meant to point out that I did not follow the argument of the noble Viscount. In one sense I hope. I am the least cynical of men, and I know that very doubtful things will pass muster at a General Election, but I think the constituencies will see that your plan is a mere blank outline which may enable a new House of Lords, however constituted, to handicap the House of Commons. But the question is how much handicap shall be put on the House of Lords. You talk of revising. You are not revising. This is checkmating.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Rosebery, who has taken so honourable and powerful a part in these discussions, has told us that he would abolish the hereditary principle. I wish he would go further and tell us what his whole plan is. My noble friend is like a dark horse in a loose box. I wish he would come out of the loose box. The Opposition plan is really no plan at all. It is a mere school-boy sketch on a piece of paper; but my noble friend, I am perfectly certain, has gone deeper into this matter than perhaps Lord Lansdowne, and if he w ill now, or whenever he thinks fit, produce a plan that would not checkmate the House of Commons but would constitute a real revising body, then I am sure he would do a useful work. I confess I do not like the words of his Resolution "strong and efficient." You are to make this House a "strong and efficient" body. Strong against whom? If it is to be strong against the House of Commons, if it is to be efficient against the House of Commons, I think your Lordships will find
<col>1000</col>
that there are behind the House of Commons forces that swear by that old institution which is as dear to them as to those to whom you gave the vote in 1867, the effect of which vote you are now- going to try to take away from them; and if you tell them that you are going to checkmate the House of Commons most assuredly yon will get the worst of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02370"><member>THE EARL. OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am only going to say one single sentence in reply to the personal appeal of my noble friend opposite. The noble Viscount calls me a dark horse in a loose box. I wish I were. I have no objection to parallels of that kind, which are only too congenial. But he appeals to me for greater definiteness in my plan, and that involves a broad principle which requires at any rate one sentence from me and which covers noble Lords behind me. It is not the place of any one but the responsible Government of the country to lay on the Table of this or the other House of Parliament a detailed scheme, a detailed Bill, an exact plan for dealing either with the composition of either House of Parliament or the relations between the two Houses. Any action of that kind on the part of the Opposition, as I said the other night, or still more on the part of an individual on the Cross Benches, is an impudent encroachment on the province of the responsible Government of the Crown. I lay that down with absolute confidence, and I defy my noble friend, amiable and controversial as he is, but somewhat erratic in his methods, to contradict that assertion or to lay down any proposition adverse to it. Another point. The noble Viscount maintained a suitable obscurity, suitable perhaps to his individual position, but not suitable to the representative of the Government. What is his plan? It is a Preamble of a Bill, a <i>paulo post futurum</i> Preamble left in absolute nebulousness, and I venture to say never to leave that dark condition.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0006P0I0505"/>
<col>1001</col>
very few. Now what has been the result of these two days discussion; what is it, in the words of the noble Viscount who has just sat down, that we have succeeded in frustrating? We have frustrated the charge being made by the Government against the Opposition that we were resisting a change in the constitution of your Lordships' House and in the relation between this House and the other House of Parliament. It was essential that the public mind should be set right upon that point. I make no doubt whatever that but for the intervention of my noble friend the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, it would have been said from a thousand platforms all over England during the next few weeks that the House of Lords had refused a change, that they had declined to have any modification made in their position in the Constitution, that they were obstructing all diminution in their privileges, and that they had no alternative plan to suggest.<lb/>
The noble Viscount finds fault with us for not having more details in our plan. We have only had a fortnight in which to formulate it, for who would have formulated a plan while the Conference was sitting? We did not know what the Conference was going to do. We did not know what would pass within the walls of that Conference. Now we have got a plan; it is a better plan than that of the Government, and it is the plan which we submit to the country. I should have liked had it been earlier in the evening to have made a comment or two on the Government plan, but it would be out of place at so late an hour. But this I will say of the Government plan, that it was constructed undoubtedly to limit and to practically destroy the usefulness of your Lordships' House. But it was above all things a plan constructed in order to pass Home Rule. The noble Viscount shakes his head. I thought in that most interesting and witty speech which he delivered to us just now almost the most interesting part of it was the passage about Home Rule. If this Bill had nothing to do with Home Rule, why did the noble Viscount spend ten minutes of his valuable time in deprecating our opposition to Home Rule?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02372"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Because Lord St. Aldwvn referred expressly to it last night, and so have other speakers.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1002</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02373"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: In referring to it to-night the noble Viscount was perfectly right. There can be no doubt whatever that the object which Mr. Redmond has, and the noble Viscount will not deny it, is to pass Home Rule. He does not care twopence about the constitutional question except from that point of view. The whole burden of what he says&#x2014;he makes no concealment about it&#x2014;is that he desires to pass Home Rule, and he has man&#x0153;uvred for years past in order to achieve this end, and now lie thinks he has got Great Britain under the harrow and can force Home Rule on the country. The Government plan would have enabled him to pass Home Rule. It is a thoroughly bad plan even from their own point of view, because although for the first two or three years the House of Commons is all-powerful, it becomes perfectly powerless during the last two or three years of a Parliament. Can you conceive a more ludicrous plan than that? The first thing they would have been obliged to do by their masters would have been to pass Home Rule. That is what we have frustrated. We have frustrated the impression which might have been given to the country that we had no alternative and better plan than this to submit in order to modify the relations between the two Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
I pass from that in order to say a word or two about our plan. What is the <i>gravamen</i> of the attack delivered against our plan in the last two or three speeches? There was the speech of the right rev. Prelate and the speech of the noble Viscount, both thoroughly undemocratic in tone, thoroughly distrustful of the people. The right rev. Prelate asked, Can you conceive working-men being asked to determine this or that particular question? We are much more democratic than the right rev. Prelate and the noble Viscount. I will tell the noble Viscount, if he will allow me, why it is we are so much in earnest about the Referendum. All politicians nowadays speak in the name of the people, they all say the people desire this or that. Everyone appeals to the judgment of the people; but the astonishing thing is that in our Constitution there is no means for ascertaining the judgment of the people. That is the absolute fact. You can arrive at a. general conclusion from a great variety of circumstances of the general complexion of Government
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0506"/>
<col>1003</col>
they wish, but as to their opinion on specific questions you know nothing whatever for certain. That is a very dangerous state of things. We are not back in the days of Burke, which the noble Viscount really represents. The old Toryism of the noble Viscount goes back to that period. In his view Members of Parliament are representatives; the people elect them Members of Parliament because they respect them and with no particular reference to the topics with which the Members have to deal in Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02374"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: In Burke's day, of course, the House of Lords had the House of Commons in its pocket.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02375"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Well, we do not want to go as far as that. I leave that kind of Toryism to the noble Viscount. What we poor, miserable, modern Conservatives want to do is really to ascertain what the wishes of the people are. We think it is profoundly dangerous that men should be allowed to speak in the name of the people and say that the people have determined this and have arrived at such a judgment, when nothing of the kind may have taken place. Even the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack claimed this evening as an absolute ascertained fact that the people had decided against the House of Lords&#x2014;against the constitution, I mean, of the House of Lords&#x2014;at the last General Election. He said he was perfectly certain of that.</membercontribution></p>

How can you be certain that they also decided against the constitution of the House of Lords? I appeal to the noble and learned
<col>1004</col>

The Lord Chancellor has now admitted, what indeed he could not deny, that a General Election can never be taken to decide any particular question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02380"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Marquess excuse me again? I quite agree that there are nearly always confused issues at General Elections, but he must not take my admissions further than that. That is what I mean, and I think that is the general sense of everybody who is familiar with elections. You must take them in the large and judge for yourselves. I do not think you can do more than that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02381"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: But we are not prepared to take them in the large and judge for ourselves. When the issues are sufficiently important we are going to ask the people what their decision is. What can be more logical, more obviously rational, than that method of solving grave political issues? The extraordinary thing is that this is really admitted. It is admitted by the noble and learned Lord in the limited sense which he has just explained; it is admitted by the Prime Minister, indeed by everybody, that a General Election cannot, at any rate always, be taken as a secure method of ascertaining the decision of the people upon the confused issues which are submitted; and for that reason we have included in our scheme the provision to which I have referred. It is a broad principle to which we shall get the assent of the country. It is a broad principle which ought to be put forward as it has been put forward by my noble friend who leads the Opposition with all the caution and with all the care of which he is master. He put it forward in a tentative but in no uncertain way, and it is, of course, capable of extension. I hope it may be extended.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0507"/>
<col>1005</col>
At any rate let us begin by trying it in matters of great gravity about which there can be no doubt that they are right and proper to be submitted to the people. If it succeeds, as I hope it may succeed, then hereafter it may be extended, and especially do I hope it may be extended in the direction which has been mentioned by several speakers&#x2014;I mean in the protection of an important minority as well as with a view of solving differences between the two Houses. One speaker&#x2014;I am not sure whether it was the noble Viscount or Lord Courtney&#x2014;said there might be great difficulty in arriving at a method by which the Referendum could be provoked by a minority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02382"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: I said there was no difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02383"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Some speaker said there would be great difficulty. I think it is hasty to say that such difficulties are insuperable. My noble friend the Leader of the Opposition mentioned one expedient which might easily be availed of in order to overcome such difficulties as are put forward. He said that the Referendum might be provoked either by a Resolution of either House of Parliament or by the decision of some impartial tribunal. It is to the latter I am referring. There seems to me no reason at all why, upon the application of an important minority some tribunal&#x2014;not necessarily a legal tribunal; it might very well be a Parliamentary tribunal&#x2014;might not decide whether the subject was of sufficient gravity to go to the people direct. I do not mention this as necessarily the best plan or the only plan, but as showing how easy it is to overcome the sort of difficulties which are put forward as standing in the way of a reasonable extension of the principle of Referendum, so that it may not only be used to solve differences between the two Houses but also to protect minorities.<lb/>
I have dealt as quickly as I could with most of the points which were raised by the noble Viscount. I should have liked to have said a word or two on the subject of the Money Resolution, but perhaps it is too late for that. I will, however, just say this, that the concession which is contained in the first paragraph of that Resolution, upon which your Lordships' House are asked to forego your undoubted
<col>1006</col>
Constitutional right to amend or reject a measure of pure finance, is intended to be a real and substantial concession. It is not a mere paper matter; it involves undoubtedly abandonment of one of the Constitutional rights of this House. But of course, it is evident that that concession would not be safe unless it were accompanied by the provisos which follow the first paragraph. Even the noble Viscount himself, in a famous passage, recognised that it might be necessary in extreme cases, even in matters which were mostly financial in character, to restrain the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02384"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I referred to wild-cat proposals from a demented House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02385"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Well, I suppose the noble Viscount conceived that there might be a demented House of Commons or it would not have been worth his while to make the observation. He admits that there are extreme cases in matters which are mainly financial. But when we turn to "tacking," every candid man will agree that if your Lordships are to be asked to abandon your right to deal with pure finance, some precaution must be taken to see that that is not availed of by means of "tacking" to pass legislation over your heads. That has been recognised by the Prime Minister in general terms, and it is, of course, very necessary that we should protect ourselves against it. It is not a mare's nest; it is a real danger.<lb/>
I do not wish to go back into old controversies, but your Lordships can well remember the Sort of thing that was said last year at the time when the great Budget struggle was; going on and before that. I remember that there was a speech by the First Lord of the Admiralty&#x2014;and I take this opportunity of saying I hope he is recovering from his grave illness&#x2014;in which he spoke of the necessity, if the Peers refused their assent to Bills in the ordinary way, of using the finance powers of the House of Commons in order to overcome them. That was a celebrated passage which was quoted at the time. That means that in the mind of the First Lord of the Admiralty, and there was another celebrated speech by the Home Secretary&#x2014;in their minds there was a regular intention to use the financial powers of the House
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0508"/>
<col>1007</col>
of Commons in order to overcome the resistance of the House of Lords in ordinary legislation. It is quite evident, then, that if we make the concession on pure finance it is necessary to prevent the policy of the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Home Secretary from being carried out, and from Finance Bills being used as a cloak for passing ordinary legislation over the heads of your Lordships' House. That is the policy which we have laid down. We desire to regularise the position of your Lordships' House in relation to finance, and in other matters we desire to trust the people. We believe that upon those two main principles we have a strong case to go before the country, and we do not fear the result.</membercontribution></p>

Does anybody suppose that any such scheme would pass the House of Commons under any circumstances if it did not make most ample provision for the predominance of the House of Commons should any such conflict take place? Really when my noble friends torment themselves with such phantoms I begin to think that their nervous system is impaired.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02400"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: More than one of the speakers opposite took objection to this particular proposal because their side would probably be in a permanent minority in any newly-composed House of hereditary Peers, and they assumed that as a matter of course the majority on this side
<col>1010</col>
of the House would send the whole of the representatives to the Joint Sitting. Surely they have forgotten that one of the cardinal principles in the Report of the Committee presided over by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches was that in any rearrange went of the House and election by the hereditary Peers of those who were to sit in the newly-composed House, there was to be a system of election either by cumulative vote or by proportional representation which would give a fair reflection in the newly-composed body of the proportions of the constituent body electing. Surely it is not an unfair thin' 2; to say that the same presumption might fairly be taken that if there is to be a Joint Sitting not composed of the members of the whole body some similar form of fair representation of the respective proportions would also be observed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02401"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, and my noble friend has also forgotten that the scheme makes provision for a large outside representation on which this House would have no influence whatever.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02405">The Lords are prepared to forego their constitutional right to reject or amend Money Bills which are purely financial in character;</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02406">Provided that effectual provision is made against tacking; and</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02407">Provided that, if any question arises as to whether a Bill or any provisions thereof are purely financial in character, that question be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, with the Speaker of the House of Commons as Chairman, who shall have a casting vote only;</p>

<p id="S5LV0006P0-02411"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I should like now to move, if it be not against precedent, or even if it be against precedent, that these Resolutions and those which were moved at my instance be communicated to the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02412">Moved, That the said Resolutions and the Resolutions relating to the proposed reconstitution of this House reported to the House on Thursday last, be communicated to the House of Commons.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Rosebery.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02413"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I ask how that process can be carried out? I am merely asking for information, because I do not know what machinery has been in the past employed or could now be employed for conveying a Message of that kind. I have no personal objection to raise to such a communication, but I confess I do not know&#x2014;perhaps some noble Lord may be able to tell me&#x2014;what machinery can be employed for that purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02414"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I presume the same machinery can be employed as is utilised for communicating to the other House a Bill which has been passed by your Lordships' House. Am I to understand that no Bill has ever passed this House and been communicated to the House of Commons?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02415"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: It is quite an ordinary practice to make communications between the two Houses of Parliament. For instance, it often happens that your Lordships desire to appoint a Joint Committee, and when you so desire you communicate
<col>1012</col>
that fact to the House of Commons. The House of Commons take the. Message into consideration, and if they approve of the proposal appoint their share of the Joint Committee. That, I think, is a precedent which might be followed in this instance, and which would fulfil the desire of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HIS MAJESTY'S SPEECH.</title>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02425">And afterwards His Majesty's most gracious Speech was delivered to both Houses of Parliament by the Lord Chancellor (in pursuance of His Majesty's Command) as follow eth:</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02426"><i>"My Lords, and Gentlemen,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02427">"I address you fur the first time under the shadow of the great calamity occasioned by the death of My beloved Father. I have received abundant evidence from every part of My dominions that the irreparable loss which has befallen Me and My family is deeply lamented by My subjects. Their sympathy has fortified Me in My sorrow, and I have devoted Myself to the duties to which I have been called with the earnest desire to follow in My dear Father's footsteps.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02428">"My relations with Foreign Powers continue to be friendly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02429">"I confidently hope that the questions connected with the North Atlantic Fisheries between Canada and Newfoundland on the one hand, and the United States of America on the other, which have been a subject of controversy for nearly a century, have been at last finally settled by the award of The Hague Tribunal. It; is a cause of special satisfaction that; it has been found possible to solve, by arbitration, problems of such an intricate and difficult nature, and that the award has been received on both sides in a spirit which must tend to increase goodwill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02430">"I recently entrusted to My Uncle, the Duke of Connaught, the mission of opening the first Parliament of the Union of South Africa&#x2014;a ceremony which it was intended that I should Myself perform. It is My earnest hope that under the legislature which he has inaugurated South Africa will continue to advance in. happiness and prosperity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02431">"In My Indian Empire, further effect has been given to the scheme of administrative reform authorised by the Indian Councils Act of 1909, by the creation of an Executive Council for the Province of Bengal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02432"><i>"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02433">"I note with satisfaction the liberality with which you have provided for the requirements of the year, including the increased grants for the Navy and the
<image src="S5LV0006P0I0512"/>
<col>1015</col>
additional expenditure upon Old Age Pensions consequent upon the removal of the pauper disqualification at the close of the present year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02434">"I thank you for the arrangements you have made for the maintenance of the honour and dignity of the Crown.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02435"><i>"My Lords, and Gentlemen,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02436">"I regret that the Conference which took place with a view to arriving at a solution of the recurring difficulties between the two Houses of Parliament has failed to come to an agreement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02437">"I am gratified that you have passed into law the Acts dealing with the Regency, and the form of the Declaration required to be made by the Sovereign on his Accession.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02438">"I thank you for the zeal with which you have carried out your duties, and I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours."</p>
<col>1016</col>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02439">Then a Commission for proroguing the Parliament was read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02440">After which the LORD CHANCELLOR said:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0006P0-02441">"My Lords and Gentlemen, By virtue of His Majesty's Commission, under the Great Seal, to us and other Lords directed, and now read, we do, in His Majesty's Name and in obedience to His Commands, prorogue this Parliament to <i>Thursday</i> the Fifteenth day of <i>December</i> One thousand nine hundred and ten, to be then here holden; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to <i>Thursday</i> the Fifteenth day of <i>December</i> One thousand nine hundred and ten."</p>
