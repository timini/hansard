<title>DISTURBANCES AT BUDGET PROTEST<lb/> MEETINGS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00087"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member> rose "to call attention to the recent disturbances which have occurred at meetings arranged to protest against the Budget; which disturbances, it is alleged, have been systematically organised for the purpose of unfairly influencing public opinion in favour of the financial proposals of His Majesty's Government."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00088">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I feel that I owe your Lordships some apology for at this late period of the session calling attention to a matter which might, perhaps, at first sight seem to be of no very great importance, but I am sure your Lordships will grant me your kind indulgence even if I fail to make good my case. Your Lordships have very little time at your disposal, and therefore I shall put my case before you as briefly as I can. I was reminded the other day by a contemporary that a question of this sort was somewhat unusual, but perhaps I may be allowed to reply that proceedings of the kind to which my Notice refers have, I am thankful to say,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0008"/>
<col>3</col>
been most unusual in the past. There is no attempt on my part to anticipate the discussion of a measure which is still being considered in another place. That forms no part of my argument. It is a matter of perfect indifference to me what is the cause for which these meetings have been held. It is a matter of moment to me that freedom of speech is being curtailed and open expression of opinion suppressed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00089">It is altogether distasteful to me to bring before your Lordships a question which may in any way be taken as showing a want of courtesy or want of consideration to noble Lords who sit opposite. I assure noble Lords opposite that I wish to treat them with every courtesy, and that anything I may say, either as regards their own utterances or as regards any course of action which members of His Majesty's Government may have taken is put with the very best intent on my part. That these things have occurred cannot be denied. There is hardly a day when we take up a newspaper that we do not read of disorderly scenes and of speakers being interrupted, and that resolutions in favour of the object for which the meetings were held have not even been able to be put. Such scenes and such disturbances as have occurred introduce a weapon of the very grossest tyranny, and they seriously endanger freedom of thought and speech in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00090">I do not for a moment wish to suggest that the noble Earl opposite or other noble Lords who sit with him are responsible for these disturbances, but at the same time it is rather difficult to persuade oneself that after so much mud has been thrown some mud should not attach itself to some of those in high office. Noble Lords will say, What has this got to do with these disturbances? I do not suggest for a moment that any member of the Government has been directly responsible for saying, "Go and break up these meetings"; but what I do maintain is this, that certain allegations have been made over a long period of time which have never been denied by those in responsible positions in the Budget League. The Budget League, which has been directly challenged, as I hope to prove in a moment, on more than one occasion, has remained perfectly silent. Its chiefs have expressed no regret, no apology for things which have occurred. I quite admit it may be difficult to prove direct interference on the part of the Budget League, but your Lordships
<col>4</col>
know perfectly well that the Budget League has a very close connection with those who at the present moment enjoy the confidence of His Majesty. Sir Henry Norman, who I believe is the moving spirit of that League, has used words to this effect. He spoke, in taking over the care of the Budget League, of the "honourable burden which had been laid upon him by the Prime Minister."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00091">Then we go a step further. Who is the President of the Budget League? The President of that League, as far as I am aware, has not come out into the open to express regret for anything which has occurred at meetings held to protest against the financial schemes of the Government. Challenge after challenge has been hurled down, allegation after allegation has been made, and not one single responsible Minister of the Crown has come forward to deny them. I might go further and say that neither the noble Earl opposite nor any other Minister, not even the Prime Minister himself, has ever said, "We prefer to leave this measure, irrefutable in its excellency, to rest upon its own merits, and we therefore deeply deplore the disturbances to which our opponents have been subjected." It is a strange thing that those in high office should be so dead to the higher responsibility which rests upon them, that they should not come out to condemn, which they might have done long ago, disturbances and acts which have directly interfered with the peace and good order of this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00092">I have before me&#x2014;it has just come into my hands&#x2014;a document which, with your Lordships' permission, I will quote. The noble Earl who sits on the Front Ministerial Bench and other noble Lords opposite need have no fear whatever although this document is headed "Votes for Women." That heading is followed by the words, "What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander"; and then follows a conversation&#x2014;an imaginary conversation, I take it&#x2014;in which two distinguished members of the present Government are made to discuss the recent disturbances at political meetings. They are congratulating themselves on the result and one of the Ministers observes&#x2014;
<quote>"Very glad these meetings have been interrupted, but do not let any one hear us say so. We tell the suffragettes that such action is an attack on the sacred rights of free speech and displays a degree of moral turpitude incompatible with the possession of a vote."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0009"/>
<col>5</col>
I venture to hope the noble Earl will tell us afterwards that all those who have taken an active part in interrupting our meetings are likewise not fit to have possession of a vote. But, instead of this, it seems to me that the supporters of the financial policy of His Majesty's Government have themselves donned those habits which have been woven by more fairylike hands. These political disturbances, therefore, must either be taken as the direct outcome of the Budget League, which is closely associated with His Majesty's Government, or else they are what may be called political riots of the utmost gravity&#x2014;riots which I venture to think His Majesty's Government, as representing the highest authority, should deal with as being against the peace and good order of this country. I was told only yesterday by a working man that night after night when he walked round to enjoy his pipe he saw meetings called to protest against the Budget invariably broken up, whilst meetings convened by the most extreme partisans of the Government were allowed to be held without molestation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00093">I pass to the character of these organised riots. I have here a short summary of the principal points which show the similarity of the character of these disturbances. There is a similarity of questions and interruptions; there is the same rule of procedure; there is the fact that these demonstrators go about in groups, many of them in the majority of cases imported from elsewhere; and there is also the evidence of forged tickets. The Budget Protest League and other kindred leagues which have for their object the holding of meetings against these proposals have on all occasions declined to allow retaliatory measures to be adopted. I can tell your Lordships on the best authority that on every occasion when the leaders of the Party of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House have protested against the conduct to which they have been subjected and have been asked by their supporters for permission to go and do the same at their opponents' meetings, they have returned a stern refusal&#x2014;that has been the case from the President of the Protest League, Mr. Walter Long, down to the most junior ward chairman. Although possibly there may have been instances&#x2014;I do not know of any&#x2014;in which noble Lords opposite or members of the Government who sit in another place have suffered from inconvenience of this sort, may I assure them that I have evidence, and know it to
<col>6</col>
be true, that on all occasions the promoters of such meetings as I have referred to have given strict orders that those of their opponents were not to be interrupted?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00094">I have here a host of evidence of the more important meetings which have been interrupted, but as time is short I will deal with one which has a most serious aspect&#x2014;the meeting at Bournemouth. In connection with that meeting forged tickets were used. There was no reason for these forged tickets; in fact, originally the meeting was convened irrespective of politics; and it was possible for members of either side to obtain tickets to listen to the speakers without going to the trouble to which they did. I have always understood that it was an invariable law that when you held a ticket given to you by the promoters of a meeting you went there as guests and with a determination to behave in a perfectly constitutional and orderly manner. May I say that since I came into the House to-day I have been reminded that a sub-agent of the Liberal party in the neighbourhood was at this meeting. That is sailing near the wind. Another point is that after a certain time the meeting was an open one. I was not there myself, but I believe the meeting was billed for eight o'clock, and after a quarter to eight the hall was thrown open without tickets; but in order to secure their presence in the hall these gentlemen, who made speech impossible in spite of the fact that they were only about twenty per cent. of the audience&#x2014;these gentlemen, by means of forged tickets, forced their way into the room and took up the most prominent positions. I have here a letter giving particulars, in which the writer says&#x2014;
<quote>"I have been informed that the forged tickets could be had at the Liberal Club."</quote>
In another passage he says&#x2014;
<quote>"A quarter to eight was the time fixed for opening the doors, but long before that time over one hundred Liberals came in, and these were the gentlemen who held the forged tickets."</quote>
I could go on quoting indefinitely to show that the majority of those who held the forged tickets were not extreme Socialists but <i>bona fide</i> Liberals and members of the Liberal Club in the constituency in which the meeting was held.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00095">I have the forged tickets here. They are of three kinds. The platform tickets were white, the gallery tickets yellow, and the tickets for the body of the hall pink.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0010"/>
<col>7</col>
Here are the genuine and the forged tickets, and they are so near one another in colour and appearance that it would be quite impossible at night for the stewards taking the tickets at the door to distinguish the difference. I feel inclined to suggest that these tickets should be handed over to the librarian for safe custody among the relics kept in the Library of your Lordships' House. Now I come to other meetings. The case of the meeting at Bournemouth is by far the worst, and I hope we shall hear from the noble Earl the Leader of the House, or from whoever replies on behalf of His Majesty's Government, something which may remove the impression which many of us must necessarily hold in connection with this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00096">There was also the meeting in Wales at which a distinguished ex-Minister spoke and of which various accounts are given. That is one serious aspect of this matter, that not only do you have meetings interrupted, but you have a willing Press distorting into an entirely false and visionary anecdote an account of those proceedings, and in fact imposing upon all those who read the accounts of those meetings a gigantic hoax. It is very easy to break up meetings, and it is still easier to write what account you choose of them. That is, as I say, one of the most serious aspects of this question, that not only are meetings broken up, but accounts appear in the Press which lead the general elector, the man in the street, to believe that those who held these meetings against the Budget had no support whatever on their side. Then I come to the meeting which was held at Portsmouth, and which was also addressed by a very distinguished Member of the other House. I have it from the distinguished Member himself and from others who were these that at this meeting method, were adopted exactly similar to those adopted at other meetings. There were the usual four gangs posted at stated intervals over the hall. At certain moments you had exactly the same form of interruption, and, although I do not wish directly to accuse His Majesty's Government of being a party to these proceedings, we have heard that remarks such as we were taught in the days of our childhood were the cause of the death of Sir Thomas a'Beckett are sometimes useful.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00097">I could quote without number the meetings which have been interrupted by those who officially, or, at all events, morally,
<col>8</col>
represent His Majesty's Government in the country. I have already cited Bournemouth and Portsmouth and the meeting in Wales. I could give instances of meetings at Barrow, Manchester, and other places. One of the most important for my purpose was a meeting to have been held at Market Harborough, and I should like to read this quotation from a letter signed by a gentleman who lives at Market Harborough&#x2014;
<quote>"A few days ago you published a paragraph with the above heading, referring to the police having refused to allow a Budget protest meeting to be held in Market Harborough."</quote>
Apparently a meeting was proposed to be held at that place, but the police declined to allow it to be held. The writer continues&#x2014;
<quote>"What happened? Only last night a Socialist meeting was held at this very spot, and the promoters had the assistance of a gramophone. It was impossible to walk on the pavement on account of the crowd, and three policemen watched the proceedings without either protest or interference."</quote>
I venture to think that such a state of things is a very serious breach of freedom of speech and an entire breach of personal liberty, and in the interest of purity of public life it ought to be stopped.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00098">I have, I hope, to some degree justified my bringing this matter before your Lordships' House. We live in days when we are governed by the group system. Day by day that group system is being extended, and surely it is all the more important that popular and free discussion should be allowed. In these days, too, when Parliamentary discussion has been so greatly curtailed, it is all the more important that public opinion should be free and open. And may I say, my Lords, that it is doubly important that this should be so in the interests of your Lordships' House, because it has always been held that your Lordships should know public opinion without hindrance and without interference. Your Lordships have ever in the days that have gone by been regarded as the final court of appeal, and I venture to think that, for this reason, this is a very proper time for your Lordships to hear the views of the people of this country openly expressed. There have been in the past great giants of Liberalism, whose doctrines we all admired&#x2014;Liberalism which has won for this country freedom of speech, freedom of action, and all those other blessings which a free country enjoys. I speak with the greatest respect of those giants of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0011"/>
<col>9</col>
Liberalism who have gone. But to-day we live under the <i>&#x0153;gis</i> of a Liberal Government. Liberalism and liberty were once synonymous. Freedom from molestation is one of the first principles of liberty, and I venture to think that if these scenes are to continue, if the subjects of the King are not to be allowed to hold meetings under whatever conditions they choose, whether with ticket or without ticket, then liberty in this country is altogether doomed. I have to thank your Lordships for the kind indulgence and the generous hearing you have given me, and I hope that what I have said has justified my bringing forward this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00099"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Earl opposite for having communicated with me to know whether this was a convenient day on which he should bring this matter forward. We also, I think, have to be obliged to him for the restraint which he put upon himself in not entering at any length into the details of the financial proposals of the Government, because I should not have been able to follow him had he done so. Nor do I propose to follow him in the somewhat general disquisition on liberty with which he concluded his observations. We also have to thank the noble Earl for being so kind as to say that he absolves us on these Benches from having given direct instructions to any bodies of people in the country to break up meetings attended by the noble Earl and his friends. That is very kind of him.<lb/>
But at the same time there ran through his speech a tone of innuendo which conveyed a degree of offence of which I think he was himself hardly conscious, because he seemed to indicate that although His Majesty's Ministers ought not to be held directly responsible for these unhappy occurrences yet there was some soft of central organisation or body which, so to speak, gave the word for the disturbance of these meetings. The central body which has been carrying on a propaganda in the country on the Government side is the Budget League, and that body has already been directly accused of having taken some part in the disturbances at meetings held by the opposite organisation, the Budget Protest League. That charge appeared, amongst other places, in a distinguished paper, the <i>Pall Mall Gazette,</i> and on August 20 Sir
<col>10</col>
Henry Norman, a distinguished member of Parliament, I think generally respected by all parties, who is the hon. secretary of the Budget League, wrote to the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Sir,&#x2014;I have read with amazement your article to-night on what you call the methods of the Budget League. A more preposterous and baseless charge as far as our knowledge goes has never been made. Never directly or indirectly, by ourselves or by our agents, by letter, word, suggestion, or hint, has the Budget League been a party to the disturbance of any public meeting. Free and uninterrupted public speech I personally always held to be one of the most precious of our common rights, and I have never in my whole political life done otherwise than discourage in the strongest manner, both privately and from the platform, any attempt to disturb an opponent's meeting."</quote>
Therefore when the noble Earl says that no person in any responsible position has expressed disapproval of the practice of disturbing meetings he is not accurate. Sir Henry Norman continued&#x2014;
<quote>"So far as Mr. Arthur Lee's Portsmouth meeting is concerned, if the charge could be more ridiculous in one case than another it would be in this case, for Mr. Arthur Lee has been an intimate and much-valued friend of mice for twenty years. I cannot sufficiently express my astonishment that a paper of the standing of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> should publish such a statement."</quote>
Then the editor wrote this note&#x2014;
<quote>"We have never for a moment intended to convey that Sir Henry Norman or the central committee were guilty of such tactics, but that the members of the League in the provinces have organised such disturbances cannot be seriously disputed."</quote>
Now, my Lords, it is important to notice the terms of the noble Earl's Notice. It runs&#x2014;
<quote>"To call attention to the recent disturbances which have occurred at meetings arranged to protest against the Budget; which disturbances, it is alleged, have been systematically organised for the purpose of unfairly influencing public opinion in favour of the financial proposals of His Majesty's Government."</quote>
That I take to be a repetition of the charge of systematic organisation by a central body, and not merely to mean that certain people in a particular locality in respect of a particular meeting have combined together to take the course of disturbing the meeting. It is important to draw the distinction because, as I say, throughout the noble Earl's speech there ran the innuendo that there was some central systematic organisation for the purpose of breaking up these meetings.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0012"/>
<col>11</col>
The noble Earl mentioned various meetings. He mentioned the Portsmouth meeting, to which Sir Henry Norman has alluded. He also mentioned a meeting in Wales at which Mr. Long attended, and which has been the subject of acute controversy, the controversy apparently being that some Liberal speakers or newspapers maintained that the meeting had been seriously interfered with, while Mr. Long all through maintained that it had not. Consequently whatever may be the facts in that case, from the noble Earl's point of view that particular meeting does not appear to support his case. Then he mentioned the case of a Budget protest meeting which ought to have been held at Market Harborough but which was not, whereas a Socialist meeting was held in the same place some time after. I confess I do not see what that has to do with His Majesty's Government. We do not give the orders to the police at Market Harborough in respect of how they should keep order or what meetings they think it necessary to prohibit, I suppose on the ground that they are likely to cause a breach of the peace; and I can only say that if these are the only instances which the noble Earl can produce, his case is not a very strong one.<lb/>
I do not hesitate, or, if I do hesitate, it is only because it seems to me so absolutely needless and superfluous, to say that I regard the breaking up or disturbance of meetings with the strongest disapproval. The noble Earl was good enough to administer to us what I can only call a lecture on the ground that we had not made formal repudiation of these proceedings. I say that is entirely unnecessary. We all agree that to disturb the meeting of an opponent is both wrong and foolish. It is wrong because it is an offence against fair play, and it is foolish because it is always bound to give the impression that your case is one which cannot be supported by argument and needs, therefore, to be supported by violence. Those are the merest truisms, and represent the opinion of all responsible people on both sides of this House and all responsible people in politics generally. And I may say, in conclusion, that the very last set of people who could be supposed to look without the strongest condemnation on the disturbance of meetings are His Majesty's present advisers, because, as the noble Earl pointed out in the course of his speech, there are those who make it a systematic practice to endeavour to prevent us from making speeches at all. I hope I have dealt finally
<col>12</col>
with the suggestion that there is anything like an organised system of disturbance of these meetings. I regret it greatly if they have been disturbed at all. There was a leading article in a paper of very strong party views&#x2014;the <i>Daily News</i>&#x2014;a few days ago, making the same protest on the same grounds which I have just stated.<lb/>
It is, of course, undeniable, and there are many previous instances of it, that, in a particular district, a meeting held to advocate a cause which is not popular and to which a great many people are opposed is liable to interruption, unless the greatest care is taken to confine such a meeting to those who are known to be in support of the speakers of the evening. That has often happened before when party politics have run high. It happened, as we all know, in a very extreme form during the progress of the South African war. Meetings were broken up then, and speakers were almost, and in some cases actually, subjected to personal violence. That I am certain was greatly regretted by noble Lords opposite, although they thought the speakers wrong. I am afraid, therefore, that it cannot be denied that in particular cases when feeling does run so high disturbances may occur; but I protest once more very strongly and indignantly against any sort of suggestion or innuendo that such proceedings have our sympathy, and still more against any suggestion that we are in any way responsible for them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00100"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House must have listened with satisfaction to the emphatic words with which the noble Earl who leads the House condemned the practice of interfering with public meetings held by one's opponents in political life. His statement left nothing to be desired in that respect, and I think the noble Earl who put this Notice on the Paper must think himself fortunate in having elicited such a declaration from the noble Earl. Of course, it never entered into the heads of any one on this side of the House to charge the noble Earl and his colleagues with any responsibility for these proceedings, but as to the facts there is no doubt. It is unfortunately the case that of late the practice of breaking up public meetings has assumed most alarming proportions. What takes place is not the kind of interruption that sometimes rather agreeably varies the monotony of a political gathering&#x2014;the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0013"/>
<col>13</col>
kind of interruption which gives the speaker an opportunty of relieving his speech by a well-placed retort. What has taken place in these cases has been the interruption of proceedings by apparently organised bands of persons imported from a distance, sometimes obtaining admission by means of those forged tickets of which the noble Earl produced interesting specimens for the inspection of the House. So far as I am aware, these practices, which have attracted a great deal of attention, have not, until this evening, received the kind of emphatic condemnation which the noble Earl has given them.<lb/>
Nothing could be more appropriate than the terms in which the noble Earl denounced such conduct, or the way in which it was denounced by Sir Henry Norman in the passage from his letter which the noble Earl quoted. Of course, it is the case that sometimes people suffer from the want of discretion and the excess of zeal of their political adherents, and I have no doubt that the words which have been spoken by the noble Earl to-night will have a salutary effect out of doors and will be attended to by some of those who have been responsible for the occurrences which we so much deplore. I venture to think that it is beyond all doubt the duty of both political parties to do what they can to put an end to proceedings of this kind, and perhaps I may say that, at this moment, we, as the weaker political party of the two, have a special right to claim that nothing should be left undone in order to relieve those who desire to make their opinions known in the country from such molestation as they have lately undergone.<lb/>
I say this because it seems to me that we are living in times when our opportunities of making our feelings known to our fellow-countrymen are becoming more and more limited. Those opportunities are of two kinds&#x2014;they are Parliamentary and they are extra-Parliamentary. Our Parliamentary opportunities, so far as the other House of Parliament is concerned, are becoming daily more restricted. You have Bills like the two great Bills which are at this moment before the House&#x2014;I mean the Irish Land Bill and the Housing and Town Planning Bill&#x2014;brought before Parliament under circumstances which render their adequate discussion quite impossible. The noble Earl himself went very near admitting that the other evening. The whole of the Com-
<col>14</col>
mittee stage of the Irish Land Bill was dealt with in eight days, four of which days were Fridays, days which are not very propitious to full debate.<lb/>
Then when we come to this House we find that our work reaches us at the very end of the session, when it is notoriously difficult for us to find sufficient time to get through the business that lies before us for transaction. Therefore, my Lords, those being the limitations upon our Parliamentary opportunities, it seems to me doubly necessary&#x2014;and I think the noble Earl who brought this matter forward had that feeling strongly in his mind&#x2014;that our opportunities for extra-Parliamentary discussion should be as full and uninterrupted as possible. For that reason I am extremely glad that we have had this short conversation, which I think goes to show that there is no difference between those who sit on that side of the Table and those who sit on this side of it in their detestation of the kind of tactics which deprive our political controversies of that element of fair play and mutual consideration which has been the pride of our political life in this country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NAVAL GERMAN INTERPRETERS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00101"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Government whether on the 1st July out of 1,779 lieutenants on the active list only eight had passed as interpreters of the German language, and of these only one was receiving additional pay for having done so; whether at that date only one out of 246 captains and three out of 365 commanders had passed in German, none of whom were receiving any extra pay in consequence; what amount of extra money had been paid to executive officers in their capacity of interpreter of the German language during the last financial year; whether any money had been paid to any executive officer for instructing officers in German during that period, and if so, how much; and whether the Government are not of opinion that a larger proportion of executive officers, more particularly those who have specialised in gunnery, torpedo, wireless telegraphy, and other technical subjects should be acquainted with that tongue, and if so, whether they will consider the advisability of revising the regulations so as to give executive officers greater opportunities for studying, and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0014"/>
<col>15</col>
increased remuneration for the time and trouble involved in the acquisition of that language.<lb/>
Only twelve out of 2,390 captains, commanders, and lieutenants on the Active List have qualified as German interpreters, and of these only three appear to be receiving any reward for having done so. I am not in favour of a very high standard of German for naval officers. What some people call a courier knowledge of the language is almost sufficient. It is not necessary for them to attain to the high literary standard required by the Foreign Office. On the other hand, they ought to be well acquainted with the technical terms used in chemistry and electricity, in gunnery and steam which are unnecessary for a diplomatist. It is quite a mistake to think that a knowledge of German is of no use at sea except when a senior officer wishes to communicate with some German vessel. The chief value of such knowledge is to my mind the capacity to assimilate German thought in technical matters. A naval officer may well read Goethe, Schiller, Heine, and Schopenhauer for amusement or as a rest from the study of professional subjects, but he ought also to read Von Treitsche and other German historians, so as to know the trend of German thought towards England, and he should study such scientific and engineering works as bear on naval matters. I am not by any means one of those who think that all naval officers ought to be linguists; but if five per cent. of our executive officers could add to their attainments the power of reading and understanding the German language, it would, I think, increase the efficiency of the Service as a whole. I look upon it as a matter for regret that so few of our specialists in gunnery, torpedo, or wireless, should be capable of studying German technical books and be able to draw their ideas from foreign countries as well as their own.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00102"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in reply to the noble Lord I have to say that on July 1, eight lieutenants had qualified as interpreters in German; of these, two were receiving additional pay as interpreters and one more had very recently been holding such an appointment. On the same date, there were one captain and three commanders qualified in German; of these latter one was holding an appointment as interpreter. Interpreter's allowance to the amount of &#x00A3;73 18<i>s.</i> was paid to executive
<col>16</col>
officers in their capacity of interpreter of the German language during the financial year language. 1908&#x2013;09. No payments were made during 1908&#x2013;09 to executive officers for instructing officers in German. Forty-seven officers of all ranks were qualified as interpreters in German on July 1; forty-eight are now qualified, and eleven officers (including one captain and four lieutenants) have proceeded abroad to study German since that date. Specialist officers are least able to spare the time for purposes of study of foreign languages abroad, since they are so constantly employed. Steps have recently been taken to extend the facilities for naval officers studying foreign languages in their own time; under existing conditions, if an officer takes lessons in his own time, actual outlay on travelling expenses and tuition fees is payable within an amount of &#x00A3;35. At present not more than five officers in any year may be given the benefit of these facilities. It has, however, been found that the exigencies of the service render it impossible always to have the full number (twenty) of officers studying abroad, and accordingly steps have been taken to increase the number of officers who may be granted facilities for studying in their own time. The Treasury have sanctioned the proposal that the number of officers who are thus given opportunity for the study of foreign languages in their own time shall not exceed twice the difference between the number of officers authorised to study abroad&#x2014;<i>i.e.,</i> twenty&#x2014;and the number actually studying at any one time. German is included in the curriculum of studies at Osborne and Dartmouth. I may add that apart from the executive officers who have actually passed the qualifying examination there is a considerable number of officers who have a more or less thorough knowledge of the German language.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00104">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00105"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill deals with a matter which is not very important in itself although it is one which enters very largely into the social life of the country. The Bill was first brought into Parliament not as a Government Bill but as a private Member's Bill, but the Home Office approved of it
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0015"/>
<col>17</col>
and it is on their behalf that I ask your Lordships to give it a Second Reading to-day. I think it will be generally agreed that there is real cause for a reform of the present practice. The present practice has been objected to on the ground that it is insanitary, and, in the opinion of many people even rather disgusting. Again, it is far from being dignified, as any of your Lordships who sit often in a Police Court and have seen the oath administered can readily testify. It is the opinion of the Home Office that the oath administered in the fashion prescribed in this Bill would be more welcome and would probably impress a witness more than the present rather hurried way in which it is administered generally in the Courts. The form and manner of administering the oath are detailed in the Schedule, and I may say that this is not introducing a new principle. It was always possible that oaths could be taken in this way, but it was not very much taken advantage of. There was some question whether it was possible to invite the witness to take the oath in this form. Some authorities thought that a witness must suggest it first of all. Your Lordships will see from the Schedule that the officer administering the oath is required to address the person taking the oath in the following form, "You swear by Almighty God to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." The witness would reply, "I do." Your Lordships will see that that adds something to the ceremony of taking the oath. At the present moment the witness says nothing himself or herself, and it is not unlikely that the new form will impress the witness more than the present method. In accordance with a promise given, I shall have some Amendments to propose when we reach the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BOARD OF TRADE BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00114" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00115">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00116"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is another Bill which is concerned with the reorganisation of a Government Department. It is one of some little importance, but I think your Lordships will not expect me to explain it at any great length. The Office of the Board of Trade still remains what it was when appointed in 1786. The Board includes various high personages; it includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Secretaries of State, Mr. Speaker in another place, and also the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. The salary of the President&#x2014;and consequently according to custom of the other officials of the Board&#x2014;was fixed in the year 1826, and has not been changed since then. Since those days the work of the Board of Trade has grown enormously, as your Lordships know, and various new duties have been thrown upon it. When the salary was fixed there was no suggestion of the existence of a railway, and all the railway work has been thrown upon the Board of Trade. Also, its purely commercial work has vastly increased since those days. New duties have continually
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0016"/>
<col>19</col>
been thrown upon it by such Acts as the Patent Act of two years ago, and now a still further extension has been made in its duties by the relations in which the Board of Trade enters with the Foreign Office in respect of the work of our Consuls abroad. Then the two Bills which have been brought up this year&#x2014;the Bill which has just been read a third time and the Labour Exchanges Bill&#x2014;also increase both the work and the responsibility of the Board of Trade. This Bill is the outcome of a Committee which sat, I think, in 1904, under the presidency of the noble Earl, Lord Jersey. That Committee recommended that the Board of Trade should become a first-class Department, that the salary of its President should be made equal to that of the heads of first-class Departments, and that fact will also, as your Lordships know, carry some additions of salary to the secretary and others in the Department. The annual increase of cost worked out at the mean of the scale of salaries will be something under &#x00A3;3,000 a year, and the immediate increase will be somewhat less than that. The only other point to which I have to call attention is that the provisions of this Bill do not come into operation during the tenure of office by its present occupant. That carries out a rule which I am bound to say I think is one more of sentiment than common sense, because if the status of the Department ought to be raised the postponement of the operation does not seem to be altogether rational. Still it has been the custom, and on the whole I think a laudable custom, that such increases should not take place in favour of those who are partly responsible for bringing them about, and it has been the particular wish of the present occupant of the Presidency of the Board of Trade that the change should not take place during his tenure of office. I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00118"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as your Lordships well know, we on this side of the House could have no manner of objection to the Bill which has just been submitted to your Lordships for Second Reading, because it had been our intention, had we survived long enough, when we were in office to pass a precisely similar measure. But it is, as the noble Earl has intimated, more than a purely departmental question.
<col>20</col>
It has, of course, a departmental aspect, because, as the noble Earl has justly said, the work of the President of the Board of Trade has increased, is increasing, and is likely to increase still further, and it has become, if the holder of the office is willing to undertake the burden, one of the most laborious offices under the Crown. But there is more than a departmental aspect, because owing to the fact that a smaller salary attaches to the office of President of the Board of Trade a lower status is supposed also to attach to it. I do not imagine that any of your Lordships, whether in office or likely to come into office in future, would shrink from public duty on any such ground as that; but some difficulty may arise in getting the best man to occupy the position of President of the Board, because, even if he does not regard it in that light, his friends often think that if he has held the office of a Secretary of State he is going down in the official hierarchy in accepting the Presidency of the Board of Trade. Therefore, great difficulties may arise in putting the best man into this position because of its alleged inferior status. What the public require is that the best man should fill the office, and I am sure it will be much easier for a Prime Minister forming a Government not to be hampered by such considerations as those to which I have called attention. Therefore, on these general grounds, as well as on the grounds put forward by the noble Earl that the weight and burden of the office have greatly increased since it was established, this measure can receive nothing but hearty support from those Members who sit on this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"1. The provisions of section seventeen of the Education Act, 1902, requiring that all matters relating to the exercise by a local education authority or council having powers under that Act of their powers under that Act shall stand referred to the education committee constituted under that section, and enabling the local education authority or council to delegate to the education committee so constituted any of their powers under that Act, shall apply not only with respect to the powers conferred on the local education authority or council under that Act, but also to any powers connected with education conferred on the authority or council under any other Act, except the power of raising a rate or borrowing money."</quote></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00147"><member>LORD BELPER</member> had several Amendments on the Paper to Clause 4 which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"4. Where with a view to following the profession of teacher a person has, in pursuance of regulations made by the Board of Education, entered into an undertaking that he will, in consideration of any grant made by the Board in respect of his maintenance, education, and training, complete the

The Amendments were to insert in various places in the clause the words "or any local education authority." The noble Lord explained that this clause was originally brought in by the Board of Education in order to enforce their contracts with regard to persons in training colleges where contracts had been entered into by persons who were legally infants. It struck a great many people that what was desirable for a Department to enable them to enforce their contracts was also desirable in the case of a local authority to enable them to enforce contracts with regard to their teachers in respect to their payments or terms of office. He understood there was some objection to this on the part of the Board. He did not exactly know what the point was as to which they objected, but he would be glad to hear what their objection was to the Amendment, and then at a later stage he would communicate with those who were responsible for this Amendment&#x2014;for it was moved at the suggestion of the Education Committee of the County Councils Association&#x2014;to see whether they wished to press it or not. But at all events there seemed to be a <i>prima facie</i> case that what was good law for one authority was good for another. He begged to move his first Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00149"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member> said the Amendment dealt with a difficulty which had arisen with reference to the position of students who went into training colleges. A great part of the cost of those training colleges was defrayed by the State and some by local subscriptions; but he was putting it broadly when he said that three-quarters of the capital cost of all training colleges now built and five-sixths of the maintenance expenses were defrayed from funds provided by the Board of Education. The difficulty that had arisen was that the great bulk of the students when they came in to
<col>24</col>
the colleges, were minors, and therefore no obligation undertaken by them at present would be legally enforcible. If they resisted the obligation which they undertook that they would devote themselves to the teaching profession or pay part of the expenses which had been incurred, it could not be enforced. If, as was suggested by the Amendment, this power was given also to the local education authority it would amount to a limitation of the area of their employment. If the authority was exercised by the Board of Education the obligation which was placed upon the students was binding and could be enforced by the Board, but they would be at liberty to accept employment in any part of the country where their services might be required. If it was enforced by a local authority, its own teachers and students would be obliged, under the noble Lord's Amendment, to serve in the particular area of the authority, and possibly without any limit of time. Under the Education Board's indenture there was a limit that they must serve the public for at least, he thought, seven out of ten years. But there was no obligation in this Amendment fixing either the locality or the time. Therefore this might be binding them for their lives to the local education authority, who were under no correlative obligation to provide employment in every case, and it would, in the opinion of the Board of Education, be very detrimental to the best interests both of education and of the administration of a public fund. He understood the noble Lord would reconsider this case, and he (Viscount Wolverhampton) would be happy to communicate with the Department in the interval, and then if the noble Lord was not convinced the question could be raised at some subsequent stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00150"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said he understood that the objection of the noble Viscount was that if this Amendment was carried it would bind, or be able to bind, those young people under a particular education authority for all their lives. Certainly he bad no knowledge that that was the intention in moving the Amendment, but obviously teachers could make a contract for a short period with an education authority, and it seemed only reasonable that such an authority should be able to enforce a contract with a minor in the same way that the Education Board were able to enforce a contract with regard to any person in a training college. But before a later period of the Bill he
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0019"/>

would take the opportunity of consulting those who had suggested this Amendment, and if they wished to press it further he would put it down at a future stage.</p>

Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890 (in this Part of this Act referred to as the principal Act), shall, after the commencement of this Act, extend to and take effect in every urban or rural district, or other place for which it has not been adopted, as if it had been so adopted."</quote>
by leaving out the words "or rural" and the words "or other place." He said that the housing problem was not so acute in the country districts as in the towns. The conditions were entirely different. This was recognised in Section 55, subsection (1) of the principal Act, which made it imperative that the necessity for the adoption of that part of the Bill should be proved before a county council before the local rural authority could adopt it. The section was repealed by the Act of 1900, but very similar clauses were inserted in that Act which were now proposed to be repealed by this Brill. The essential differences between the ownership of houses in town and in rural districts should be taken into consideration. Houses were held in towns purely as a commercial investment, and from which the owner sought to get the best return he possibly could, while in rural districts landlords who held the working class houses held them not as a commercial investment, but very frequently more at a loss than a profit and as an adjunct to the equipment of an estate. Secondly, he would ask their Lordships to consider the difficulties of water and drainage schemes in the country as compared with the towns. Thirdly, the rating conditions were entirely different, and the rents from the houses in the rural districts were considerably lower than those in towns, and consequently there was a greater risk to the rates. When they considered these things he thought it must be evident that the provisions which had been inserted in former Acts requiring that the necessity should be proved before a county council before a rural authority could adopt Part III of the principal Act were even more necessary now owing to the greatly extended scope of this Bill and as a safeguard against the adoption of hasty schemes which might greatly embarrass a

<col>27</col>
rural district. The object of his Amendment was to give rural districts the power of adoption if they wished it instead of its being compulsory as this Bill would make it. If Part III was extended to every rural district on the application of four inhabitant householders, who need not even be direct ratepayers, they might force the Local Government Board to put into operation this Act and compel the rural authority to make a town planning scheme which would be a very serious burden to the rural authority.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00170"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member> said it was perfectly true, as the noble Lord had said, that there was a great difference in the problem with regard to the housing question as between rural and urban districts. The Government had tried to recognise that difference throughout the Bill so that they could deal with at the same time rural or urban lands. The need for housing accommodation in the rural districts, he thought, was generally admitted, and most of their Lordships who had experience of the country districts knew there was an urgent need for more houses. The Report of the Select Committee of 1896 laid considerable emphasis upon that. The Amendment of the noble Lord, which proposed that the words "or rural" should be omitted from this clause, struck really at the root of the whole Bill. This was one of the main provisions of the Bill, that the Housing of the Working Classes Act should be applied to rural districts without the need of special legislation. He hoped the noble Lord would not press his Amendment. The Government recognised that there were strong objections held to various clauses in the Bill by noble Lords opposite, and His Majesty's Government hoped to accept some of the Amendments suggested by the Opposition and to move others themselves. The Government also hoped that the Bill would practically, at any rate in its main outline, retain the shape in which it was introduced to their Lordships' House and would eventually become law. But he did not know whether the noble Lord realised that the Amendment technically went a great deal further than the mover intended. In one of the schedules the sections of the original Act were repealed unless they were
<col>28</col>
enacted for other purposes in this Bill itself, and therefore it would be impossible for any rural area to adopt the provisions of the Act the sections of which had been repealed. It would be obvious, therefore, to their Lordships that the step which would be taken if the Amendment was adopted would be actually a retrograde one, putting the position in rural areas behind what it was in 1880. He was sure that that was not the intention of the noble Lord, and in those circumstances he hoped that he would not press the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00171"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> said he would withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00173"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member> put the Question, "That Clause 1 stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00174"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said he wished, on this Question, to remind their Lordships of the very great importance of this clause. No one could appreciate the Bill properly who did not bear in mind the enormous change which this clause made in the existing law. At the present time under Part III housing schemes could not be forced upon any local authority. This clause made the scheme compulsory upon every local authority. Therefore when in later clauses they found that powers were given to the Local Government Board, their Lordships must always remember that it was not merely that they were giving the Local Government Board more powers, but they were giving powers to enforce Part III which up to the present time had not been compulsory upon any local authority. He merely made that remark because he was sure that unless their Lordships kept that in mind all through the Bill they would fail to appreciate the importance of it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00175"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> said that, although the Amendment to this clause had been withdrawn, he wished to say a few words in support of the views expressed by the noble Lord with regard to the need for these schemes in rural districts. The noble Earl who was in charge of the Bill had said that in rural districts there was more need for additional buildings and the further building of cottages than in the towns. It might be so in certain rural districts, but it was not, so in all rural districts. A rather curious circumstance had come to his know-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0021"/>
<col>29</col>
ledge with regard to this point. The Local Government Board not very long ago, if he was not misinformed, sent out a circular to rural district councils throughout the country asking them to report to the Board if there was a great lack of accommodation and a great lack of cottages for the working classes in their particular rural districts. The rural district with which he happened to be acquainted replied pointing out that after due inquiries of every kind they could not report to the Local Government Board that there was any need for further accommodation for the working classes in their district. He could not believe that that was a unique case in this country. He did not know whether the noble Earl would give them any further information about the inquiry that was made by the Local Government Board. He thought it would be rather germane to this point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00176">Clause 1 agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00177">Clause 2:
<quote>"2.&#x2014;(1) A local authority may be authorised to purchase land compulsorily for the purposes of Part III of the principal Act, by means of an order submitted to the Local Government Board and confirmed by the Board in accordance with the First Schedule to this Act.</quote>
<quote>(2) The procedure under this section for the compulsory purchase of laud shall be substituted for the procedure for the same purpose under section one hundred and seventy-six of the Public Health Act, 1875, as applied by subsection (1) of section fifty-seven of the principal Act.</quote>
<quote>(3) A local authority may, with the consent of and subject to any conditions imposed by the Local Government Board, acquire land by agreement for the purposes of Part III of the principal Act, notwithstanding that the land is not immediately required for those purposes."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00178"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> moved an Amendment to dispense with the Local Government Board's confirmation of Orders submitted to them for the compulsory purchase of land for housing. He said this was one of a series of Amendments which he was going to propose in this clause and in the schedule, and he thought it would be convenient and save time if he explained the general meaning of his Amendments. First of all he would take the state of things which this clause, taken in connection with the First Schedule, proposed to introduce. If they would turn to the schedule they would see that where a local authority proposed to purchase land compulsorily under this Act they might submit to the Board an Order. Then in subsection (6), if within the
<col>30</col>
prescribed period&#x2014;that was, the period prescribed by the Board&#x2014;no objection was taken, or if it was withdrawn, it was provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"the Board shall, without further inquiry, confirm the order."</quote>
That meant that they gave it the force of an Act of Parliament. But if objection had been presented and had not been withdrawn the Board had to forthwith cause a public inquiry to be held. Then they received the report, and after considering the report they might then confirm the Order. And after the Order was confirmed, if their Lordships would look at subsection (2), they would see that it was final, that it took effect as if enacted in this Act. The words were&#x2014;
<quote>"and the confirmation by the Board shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act have been complied with, and that the order has been duly made and is within the powers of this Act."</quote>
That gave to the Local Government Board the most complete and the most absolute authority to make and to confirm an Order without any reference to Parliament. That was the effect of the clause which related to this subject. If they would return to his Amendment, which also must be read together with part of the schedule which it did not propose to repeal, they would see that it provided that if within the prescribed period no objection to the Order had been presented to the Board by persons interested in the land, or if every such objection had been withdrawn, the Board should, without further inquiry confirm the Order, either without modification or subject to modification. That was an unopposed Order. If they looked at subsection (4) of his proposed new subsections standing on the Paper, with regard to which he would say a word or two in a moment, they would see the requirement that that Order should be laid before Parliament. In the case of an Order to which objection had been taken, he proposed that the Board should appoint an impartial person, not in the employment of any Government Department, to hold a public inquiry, and if on considering his report it appeared to the Board that by reason of the extent or situation of any land proposed to be acquired compulsorily, or the purposes for which such land was used, or any other circumstance, the land ought not to be acquired compulsorily without the sanction of Parliament, the Order of the Board should
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0022"/>
<col>31</col>
be provisional only and should not have effect unless confirmed by Parliament. Therefore his proposal with regard to an opposed Order was that it should be confirmed by Parliament. He now desired to call their Lordships' attention to subsection (4) of his Amendments, which provided that an Order other than a Provisional Order made by the Board under this section should come into force after it had lain on the Table for thirty days subject to an Address. That subsection, and indeed all this Amendment, was taken from the Port of London Bill to which His Majesty's Government acceded last year, and the object of subsection (4) was to meet particular cases. He thought he had now fully explained his Amendments as a whole, and their Lordships would understand that when he moved his first Amendment it was because of the proposals which were almost immediately going to follow.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00180"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he was much obliged to the noble Earl for having described his Amendments, because it was difficult to refer to one without referring to them all, and in a complicated case like this the course adopted was far the most convenient. The noble Earl had also described the effect of his Amendments and the proposals of His Majesty's Government in a way to which he could add nothing. He could only explain the reasons which had induced His Majesty's Government to put these particular provisions in the Bill, and why they preferred them to the Amendments proposed by the noble Earl. The course which His Majesty's Government suggested should be followed was the course which their Lordships had already agreed to in the Small Holdings Act. The noble Earl, on the contrary, was anxious that their Lordships should in this case follow the provisions of the Port of London Act. He would give one or two reasons to explain why His Majesty's Government preferred the procedure of the Small Holdings Act. In the first place it was cheaper; they thought it was more expeditious, and perhaps better suited for the particular cases with which this Act would deal. On the other hand, the procedure prescribed under the Port of London Act was long and expensive, and was more suitable in the case of the Port of London where the land was
<col>32</col>
frequently owned by persons with whom the Port of London Authority were in competition. Therefore in the matter of land the Port of London Authority was, as it were, one of the parties to the case. That was not so in this Bill. The Local Government Board was rather in the impartial position of an arbitrator. The Port of London Authority was anxious to acquire land in the neighbourhood, and would enter into competition with those people whom the Port of London Authority displaced. Therefore they were in no sense an impartial authority, and consequently it was quite right than an arbitrator should be appointed from outside. But here the Local Government Board were not parties to the case. That, he thought, made a considerable difference, and that was why it was unnecessary to call in a person not in the employ of any Government Department. It they began to call in an outside person they had to pay his expenses, which would necessarily add to the costs under this Bill. He asked their Lordships to consider for a moment what those expenses would be. When once they added the fee of an arbitrator of this kind to the expenses of such an inquiry, they had then added no inconsiderable sum to the expenses of the four or five acres which perhaps was all that the local authority was seeking to acquire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00181"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said it need not be only four or five acres.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00182"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that beyond that explanation he was not sure that he need detain their Lordships longer. The point at issue between His Majesty's Government and these Amendments was clear. Their Lordships had agreed to a procedure in regard to another measure which the Government thought should be similar in this case, and he hoped their Lordships would allow this procedure to stand under this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00183"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said there would be no difference of opinion on either side of the House as to the desire that proceedings under this clause should be as far as possible cheap and efficient, and as rapid as might be in the circumstances of the case; and they ought to remember that this clause did not relate to what in his judgment was the more important proposal of Part I of this Bill&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0023"/>
<col>33</col>
namely, the making of orders by the Local Government Board on local authorities to do certain work&#x2014;but related solely to procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land after such an order had been made. He could very well understand the reasons which induced His Majesty's Government to follow the procedure of the Small Holdings Act in this Bill. That procedure was carefully examined in Parliament, and might be said to have been the result of an agreement on both sides in both Houses. And so far as he was aware, excepting in one point, he thought it had proved satisfactory with regard to the acquisition of small holdings. That one point, to his mind, was a serious defect in the procedure, and that was the absence of any appeal from an Order of the Board of Agriculture to a Court of Law on a point of law. After all, Government Departments, however admirably conducted, were not infallible. They might in making an Order interpret the law in a wrong direction, and it was right that His Majesty's subjects should in all cases such as this have the protection of the Courts of Law. And therefore if the procedure proposed in this Bill, copied from the Small Holdings Act, was to remain, he trusted that His Majesty's Government would favourably consider some Amendment giving protection in those cases.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00184">The noble Earl spoke of the acquisition of four or five acres, and referred to it as a comparatively small matter; but this part of the Bill applied, not only to rural districts, but to the largest towns in the country, and the purchase of four or five acres of land in London or Manchester or Birmingham would be a transaction of great magnitude, requiring a very great expenditure, and involving a very considerable price to be paid for the land required. He did not think it was reasonable that cases such as these should be dealt with precisely on the same lines as the acquisition of a few acres of land outside a country village. The matter was far more akin to the acquisition of land under the Port of London Act of last session than to the acquisition of land under the Small Holdings Act, and surely it was not unreasonable that the noble Earl below the Gangway should have suggested to their Lordships that that being so the procedure under the Port of London Act was more applicable than that under the Small Holdings Act. The noble
<col>34</col>
Earl opposite stated that in that case the Port Authority was one of the parties concerned, and therefore it was right that there should be a provision for an impartial arbitrator to be appointed in any matter of the kind. The noble Earl contended that in this case the Local Government Board was absolutely impartial, and that therefore no such provision would be required. But what was the position of the Local Government Board? It had made an Order compelling a local authority to carry out a scheme under Part III of the Housing and Working Classes Act, which enabled that authority to exercise compulsory powers for the purchase of land. It was an absolutely interested Board, because the great difficulty in this matter, as everybody knew, was the question of expense, and the Local Government Board could not but desire in carrying out its powers under this Bill to secure the land at the cheapest rate possible. Therefore it seemed to be almost as interested as the Port Authority under the Port of London Act. For these reasons he hoped His Majesty's Government might reconsider their opposition to the proposals of his noble friend, and that, at any rate if they felt it necessary to adhere to a simpler procedure in the case of the rural areas, they would afford to the owners of valuable land in the large cities in this country as great a protection as had been afforded in the case of the Port of London Act.</p>

Except in the interests of general economy, there is no reason why they should care how much is paid for the land. They are not concerned in the local rate rising in consequence of an excessive price being paid. They are, I should have thought, in as impartial a position as any set of people can be who are called in to adjudicate upon a particular subject.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00192"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> hoped His Majesty's Government would give their Lordships better reasons for resisting this proposal. What were the reasons? Their Lordships had not been informed. The noble Earl who had charge of the Bill told them it would be more expensive. Well, it would be very little more expensive. The noble Earl told them it would be slow. Well, he hoped their procedure was going to be slow when they were going to take other people's property compulsorily. This was not a matter which required any urgency. Any action
<col>36</col>
that was taken under Part III of the principal Act should be taken deliberately. There was no earthly object in hurrying the matter; and as far as expense was concerned, he had yet to learn that the expense would be great, although, of course, if it was really great that was, no doubt, a certain objection. Yet he could not help thinking that it was better for owners that the process of taking their property from them compulsorily should be a little more expensive, than that they should be left entirely at the mercy of a Government Department. He did not in the least agree that the Local Government Board had no interest in the matter. It was true it had no pecuniary interest, no interest which could be pointed to as a material consideration, but the Local Government Board, just like every other office, had the greatest interest in carrying out its schemes and its theories. They had seen how it was with the Small Holdings Act, how the Board of Agriculture had staked its reputation, or, at least, the Minister of Agriculture had staked as it were the credit of the Government, upon the large spread of small holdings. Was that not interest? And very much the same thing might happen under this Bill. He hoped his noble friend would not give way about this Amendment. He thought it was a most important point. As for differentiating between a rural or county borough, as had been spoken of, he would hesitate very much to recommend their Lordships to consider the interests of the larger of the rich owners of a town rather than the small owners in the country districts. He thought everyone should be defended in the possession of his property. It would not be difficult to show that in some instances the Small Holdings Act had not worked very successfully in the way of protecting owners from having their land taken from them at a lower rate than ought to have been paid. But at any rate in this matter he thought they should observe the principle that if a man's land was to be taken compulsorily it should only be done after a thoroughly impartial inquiry and by a slow process. He liked the process because it was slow, and he ventured to think that it ought to commend itself to the Committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00193"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said that His Majesty's Government could not consider the Amendment without seeing what it was to lead to, and the real difference
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0025"/>
<col>37</col>
between the Government and the noble Earl was this. The noble Earl wished to secure an impartial inquiry. The Government, however, intended to send down some one from the Local Government Board who would not be in a position of impartiality. To insist upon that provision placed the landowners at the mercy of the Local Government Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00194"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member> pointed out that the procedure followed exactly that of the Small Holdings Act, which had been agreed to on both sides of the House. He thought he could fairly say that the wisdom of their Lordships in passing that Act had been demonstrated. It had been working smoothly and without friction, and there was only one county council in England which refused to act. In a period of fourteen months 44,000 acres had already been obtained by schemes and orders, and they received applications for about 1,000 acres a week. There were no cases of hardship as far as he could make out; and there had been only two cases of alleged hardship, which had been proved to be trumped up and bogus. He did not think, in the circumstances, there need be any apprehension in putting this Bill under the same procedure as the Small Holdings Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00195"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that the noble Earl had imported into the discussion a new feature altogether. As that had been done, Jet him state what a Judge had said with regard to a recent case in Norfolk. There was an occupier of two farms, one with heavy land, and the other with lighter land, and a compulsory Order was made, in spite of his opposition, acquiring the light land farm for small holdings. He sought before the Court to show that the Board of Agriculture had disregarded some provisions of the Act in confirming the Order. He went into Court, and what happened? He (Lord Camperdown) had an extract in his hand from the judgment of Mr. Justice Darling, delivered on the 12th July this year. The Judge said&#x2014;
<quote>"Here is a Public Department put in a position of absolute supremacy. Whatever the action of the farmer was who came to the Court asking for relief under the Order, the Court can only say that Parliament has enacted only last year that the Board of Agriculture, in acting as they had, should be no more impeachable than Parliament itself."</quote>
<col>38</col>
That was the exact position; and if their Lordships wanted to know how that was arrived at, let them look at the First Schedule, subsection (2), which provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"An Order when so confirmed shall become final and have effect as if enacted in this Act; and the confirmation by the Board shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act have been complied with, and that the Order has been duly made and is within the powers of this Act."</quote>
There they had the opinion of a Judge which showed that they had entirely taken away from the Courts of law any control whatever on any matter with regard to the Small Holdings Act. His case had been put so much better by Viscount St. Aldwyn and the Duke of Northumberland that he hesitated about saying even one word more, but when the noble Earl told him that the Port of London Act had no strict analogy to this Bill, he thought the noble Earl had hardly appreciated what he had pointed out in speaking on Clause 1, which placed compulsion upon all local authorities with regard to housing schemes, whether in town or country. It did not at all follow that three or five acres might be taken. It might be 100 or 200 acres. In cases of that sort, was the best way simply the way which they said was the cheapest? Had justice nothing to do with it? For that reason he thought that the procedure which they sanctioned with regard to the Small Holdings Act certainly did not apply in cases of great importance such as this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00196"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am tempted to say a word with regard to this Amendment, because it seems to me to raise a question of principle of the first importance&#x2014;a question of principle which runs all through the Bill now before us, and not only through this Bill but through many other Bills which we have to consider. In these days we are constantly offered legislation for the purpose of enabling houses or land&#x2014;private property&#x2014;to be taken away from the owners of such property for one purpose or another. Now nobody, I think, will be found to contend that there is anything unreasonable in depriving owners of their land or their property for some useful public purpose. The only question that does arise is what safeguards you are going to put in the way
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0026"/>
<col>39</col>
of the arbitrary acquisition of such property; what precautions you are going to take that those who are deprived of it are adequately compensated for their loss. We are regarded by the noble Earl opposite as unduly apprehensive in regard to the wide powers which this Bill confers upon the Local Government Board. I can assure him that in that feeling, which is a widely prevalent feeling, no question of personal mistrust or suspicion enters. But what we do feel, and feel very strongly, is that these heads of Departments must from the very nature of things be not wholly disinterested and indifferent in the manner in which they deal with them. I go further. I think it is most desirable that a Minister in charge of legislation such as that we are now considering, or of legislation such as that embodied in the Small Holdings Act, should be more or less of an enthusiast in the cause which he has to champion. And I think, without disrespect to the noble Earl who presides over the Board of Agriculture, I do not think I should be doing him an injustice if I imputed to him a great deal of enthusiasm for the cause he so persistently advocates in this House and in the country. But that enthusiastic temperament does not always produce an absolutely judicial frame of mind, and our fear is that in these cases the Ministers who will have to give effect to the provisions of a Bill such as this will be carried away by that feeling of enthusiasm, and not only that, but the staff will become infected also with that temper of enthusiasm. Indeed I do not think it is altogether unfair to suggest that these gentlemen sometimes owe the official position which is given to them to the fact that they are enthusiasts and desire to make a success of the enterprise at no matter what cost. Therefore when the President of the Board of Agriculture comes to the Table and tells us that this Bill is on all-fours with the procedure under the Small Holdings Act, I am not in the least reassured. The subject-matter, moreover, is of an entirely different character. Under this Bill you may deal not merely with the acquisition of a few acres for villagers who desire to be provided with small holdings. You may deal with great schemes involving important interests in urban areas, and you may deal with them over the heads of great municipal bodies who are at present responsible for these matters. The noble Earl pointed out to us that in his opinion the procedure resorted to under
<col>40</col>
the Port of London Bill was not appropriate to the Bill on the Table. I must say I was not greatly convinced by the argument which the noble Earl produced. For example, I do not think he was entirely successful in showing that the procedure suggested by my noble friend Lord Camperdown would necessarily involve either great delay or great expense. We all of us desire to avoid delay or expense, but let me remind the Committee that the Act referred to is not the only precedent to which we have a right to refer. There are other Acts. For example, I am under the impression that under the London Building Act of 1894 the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act apply, and that you have a commission of three members who have to deal with disputed cases under that Act. But there is another case to which I should like to call the attention of the noble Earl. We have all of us seen a Bill which has not yet come to this House&#x2014;the Development Bill. Now, as we understand the Development Bill, there may under that Bill arise cases in which private property is to be interfered with, as under this Bill, for some public purpose. What is proposed in the Development Bill is that the Lands Clauses Act shall apply, and that disputed cases of compensation are to be decided, not by an arbitrator appointed by a Government Department, but by the Lord Chief Justice&#x2014;a very different provision. I must say that I hope my noble friend will insist upon his Amendment. It seems to me it is a duty that we owe to ourselves to include in this Bill some machinery which is more likely to inspire public confidence than that which it now contains, and I really venture to suggest to noble Lords opposite that it is not only due to Parliament and the public that this should be done. It seems to me fairer to the Minister who is at the head of a Department that he should be relieved of the tremendous responsibility of finally deciding in important cases of this kind. He may desire ever so keenly to be absolutely impartial, but after he has warmly espoused a cause, after he has, perhaps, conducted a heated controversy about a particular case, it is absolutely impossible that in the last resort, when he has to decide in a judicial capacity on the merits of that case, he should attract to himself that confidence which we should like to see all the heads of public Departments enjoy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00197"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must endeavour to explain how it is that His Majesty's Government cannot find themselves convinced by the arguments put forward from the other side of the House. I may say, first, that the noble Earl opposite, who is always fair, was really not quite correct when he said that Earl Carrington had imported a new element into the discussion when he referred to the matter of small holdings, because he was directly challenged on that point by the noble Duke opposite. The noble Marquess who has just sat down has stated clearly what is the fear noble Lords have under this Bill, and, as he said, under other Bills. He is afraid that the particular office concerned might become impregnated with enthusiasm for their measures and might not deal quite fairly with those whose property is to be taken, because they were anxious to see these measures work, and because of the natural enthusiasm with which a particular Minister may be inspired. I do not deny that in theory there are arguments which can be used in support of a view of that kind, but our fear, as I think I indicated on the Second Reading of this Bill, is of an opposite kind, and the rational course, I think, is to attempt to strike a balance between the two opposing dangers. We say that the danger of all these guarantees and safeguards is that you so hamper the conditions under which your Bill is to be carried out that you destroy thereby no small part of its usefulness. We have all known cases of Acts which have been passed with the utmost goodwill, and not without high hopes of their social value, but which for some reason have remained nugatory, and no proceedings have been taken under them. We are afraid, if all this safeguarding is overdone, that something of the kind will happen in this case. The noble Marquess, with his usual dialectical skill, has spoken of this Bill as though it dealt only with urban land of great value. Surely that is not so. We hope that a very large number of quite small transactions will take place under this Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00198"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Excuse me; my point was that not only small transactions, but very large transactions could take place under this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00199"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is quite true, but the noble Marquess only mentioned the very large-priced transactions. The noble Duke has spoken frankly from
<col>42</col>
the point of view of the owner of the land to be taken. He is quite entitled to do that, and we all agree that the interests of the owner ought to be safeguarded. The noble Duke says he does not mind the delay. It may be the case that a few months more or less may not be of great importance, though as a matter of fact, if it is a question of confirming a Provisional Order, the delay may in some cases reach a period of two years. But I set that aside. The real reason of all this is not so much the delay or the expense, except so far as it would prevent a transaction taking place at all. There is one person who is very often alluded to from the opposite Benches&#x2014;but who has not been alluded to at all in this connection&#x2014;the ratepayer. These local authorities, particularly the small authorities, are likely to be debarred from these transactions at all if the expenses are likely to be as great as suggested. We have to read this Amendment concurrently with other Amendments&#x2014;for instance, that which permits, under the instruction of an outside arbitrator, the employment of counsel and expert witnesses. What is likely to happen? A district council wants to take from some rich and powerful landowner a small portion of land. They know that they may have to meet some of the extremely able and very costly counsel who adorn the rooms upstairs, and that all manner of expert valuers may be brought down from London to give evidence of the value of the land. What will be the result? They will not attempt the transaction at all. We ask you to realise the nature of our fears. It is not a question of a month or two or a question of a few pounds, but it is the dread which we have, the alarm which is caused in our minds, by not only this Amendment, but the whole series of Amendments, which, of course, it is in your Lordships' power to carry. We are afraid that the operations of the Bill will be so narrowed by these Amendments that although it may look very well, the greater part of its usefulness will disappear, and on these grounds we are bound to resist this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00200"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> was sure that their Lordships must have been very interested at hearing the noble Earl put forward as one of the main objects which the Government had in promoting the Bill the interests of the ratepayers. Most of those who had read the Bill with
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0028"/>
<col>43</col>
some care had come to the conclusion that the last person the Government had considered was the ratepayer; and indeed one of the most striking illustrations of that attitude of mind on the part of His Majesty's Government was that under the present Bill, as the noble Earl knew, in certain circumstances the county council was given authority to override the authority of a district council and to impose upon them the obligation of providing housing accommodation. Under the existing Act there were some very careful provisions laid down, among others that the county council were to have regard to the interests of the ratepayers in the coercive action which they took. Judging from what the noble Earl had just said, one would have expected to have found those conditions reproduced in the present Bill as limiting the action of the Local Government Board. But nothing of the kind. The Local Government Board was not called upon at any moment, from one end of the Bill to the other, to have regard to the interests of the ratepayer. The noble Earl had said that his noble friend, in proposing his Amendment, had overlooked the fact that the extra expense involved in procedure would debar the authority from exercising its powers under the Bill. The great difference between the proposal of the Government and the proposal of his noble friend had already been pointed out to them by the Lord Chief Justice. The great difference was that his noble friend proposed an impartial inquiry, whereas the Government proposed one which was not impartial. That was the only difference. There was no reason why one procedure should be more expensive than the other. In one there was to be a local inquiry, but in either case the Local Government Board had to take into consideration the result of that inquiry, and there was really no reason in the world why one procedure should be more expensive than the other. The noble Earl, feeling the weakness of his contention, had referred in a vague manner to other Amendments later in the Bill which their Lordships might or might not agree to; but so far as the Amendment before them was concerned, there was really no reason why the procedure contemplated by his noble friend should be more expensive than the other. There was one exception, and that was where the matters in dispute were of great importance. Then they ought to go before Parliament. Was that
<col>44</col>
unfair? Under his noble friend's proposal when the matter in dispute was of great importance, then the impartial person had to send it before Parliament. That was perfectly fair, because, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, they were not dealing with a small authority wishing to acquire a few acres of land, but with a large and important authority dealing with an important matter. There could be no reason in the world why, in the case of a large urban authority entering upon a large housing scheme, the matter should not go before Parliament. In a case of that kind, the small extra expense involved would be very properly involved, because of the importance of the consideration. Therefore, it seemed to him that the proposal of the Government was not sound, and he hoped his noble friend would succeed in inserting his Amendment in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00201"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that noble Lords on his side of the House were put in rather a difficulty when such a speech as the one they had just listened to was made. He thought they were considering the general scheme of the noble Earl who himself suggested that it should be discussed on this occasion. The noble Marquess said that they had no right to refer to these other clauses which the noble Earl was the first to mention to their Lordships' House. Under those circumstances it put the Government side of the House in a considerable difficulty, and he thought if noble Lords opposite referred to certain clauses they should be allowed to do the same. The particular point upon which they were not agreed was the question of expense. It was not very difficult to show that the scheme provided by the noble Earl might lead to a very great deal more expense than the scheme provided by the Bill. The Bill before their Lordships simply provided for the Local Government Board, but the scheme of the noble Earl, which they were discussing, provided for an arbitrator who might hear expensive witnesses. In those circumstances it seemed to him quite obvious that the scheme of the noble Earl was considerably more expensive than the scheme of the Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00204">Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00205"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> then moved the new subsections which he had previously outlined. He said that as their Lordships had been good enough to allow him to make an explanation of the general effect of his Amendments it would be unnecessary for him to trouble the Committee with many words. He would only just briefly say, for the information of Lord Crewe, that the subsections were taken from the Port of London Bill, and
<col>46</col>
they were taken for this reason, that the subject-matter of the Bill before them was much more nearly related to the subject-matter of the Port of London Bill than it was to the Small Holdings Act. He knew that as the Port of London Bill originally stood a different procedure was proposed; it was strongly opposed by counsel, and in the end the Joint Committee rejected the proposal which was made to them and substituted this proposal. It was for that reason he had inserted it.</p>

<quote>(2) If within the period prescribed by the Board no objection to an Order under this section has been presented to the Board by a person interested in the land, or if every such objection has been withdrawn, the Board shall, without further inquiry, confirm the Order either without modification or subject to such modifications as they think fit, but if such an objection has been presented and has not been withdrawn the Board shall appoint an impartial person not in the employment of any Government Department to hold a public inquiry on their behalf in the locality in which the land is proposed to be acquired, and the local authority and all persons interested in the land, and such other persons, as the person holding the inquiry in his discretion thinks fit to allow, shall permitted to appear and be heard at the inquiry.</quote>
<quote>(3) If the person who held the inquiry reports, or if on considering his report, it appears to the Board that by reason of the extent or situation of any land proposed to be acquired compulsorily, or the purposes for which such land is used, or any other circumstances, the land ought not to be acquired compulsorily without the sanction of Parliament, the order of the Board shall be provisional only and shall not have effect unless confirmed by Parliament.</quote>
<quote>(4) An Order other than a Provisional Order made by the Board under this section shall come into force after it has lain for thirty days during the Session of Parliament on the table of both Houses of Parliament, unless either House during those thirty days presents an address to His Majesty against the Order, in which case no further proceedings shall be taken thereon, but without prejudice to the making of a new Order."&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Camperdown.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00207">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00208"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to insert the following new sub-section&#x2014;

He had placed the Amendment on the Paper for the purpose of safeguarding land which had been acquired by the owners under any local Act or Provisional Order from being compulsorily taken away by a local authority, and also for the purpose of asking their Lordships to confirm the general principle that land acquired by sanction of Parliament ought not to be taken away at all except by a Provisional Order confirmed by Parliament. But at present he would not move his Amendment, because there was another Amendment down in Viscount St. Aldwyn's name which covered it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00211"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> moved the omission of the words which restrict the benefits of the clause, including those of minimum rate of interest and period of repayment, to local authorities. He said the clause provided that loans might be made by the Public Works Loan Commissioners at the minimum rate allowed for the time being for loans out of the Local Loans Fund. It did not extend that favourable rate of interest to loans made to other persons who were also authorised by the existing law to borrow from the Public Works Loan Commissioners for the same purpose, but confined it to local authorities. Those persons included railway and dock and harbour companies, water companies, companies employing a considerable number of the working classes for whom accommodation might be required, and also owners of land and even leaseholders who had an interest of not less than fifty years. In the rural districts and in not a few urban districts, the cottages of the working classes had been supplied by private persons or companies, rather than by public authorities, and he believed any future provision was likely to be made in the same way. Why, then, should those persons not be allowed the same facilities as local authorities? He had asked on Second Reading why those favourable terms with regard to the rate of interest on loans should not have been extended to all who were authorised to borrow under existing Acts, and the only answer he received from the noble Earl the Leader of the House was that the Treasury had been lenient in one case and would not extend their leniency to another. He did not press the Amendment because it might be a matter
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0031"/>
<col>49</col>
of privilege, but he raised it as an appeal to His Majesty's Government to reconsider their decision, which of course could be altered in another place. He was sure there could be no better public object than the provision of good housing accommodation for the working classes, and he could not understand why, when the Public Works Loan Commissioners were authorised to lend to all the parties he had named, just as they had been authorised to lend to the local authorities, the same rate of interest should not be charged to the persons named as to the local authorities. If that were done it surely would be in the interests of the cause they all had at heart.</p>

He thought their Lordships would see that generally, with regard to the class of buildings that would be put up, it was not a very satisfactory security for a loan which would be spread over a period of eighty years. Of course, the case of local authorities stood upon a different basis, because they had other funds at their disposal which naturally were security for the repayment of the loans. But if they were not dealing with authorities of that kind, he thought it was not surprising that the Treasury had said that that was lending money to individuals as well as to societies without having security for the repayment of the money.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00220"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> had the following new clause on the Paper, to be inserted after Clause 6&#x2014;
<quote>"Any local authority in connection with the exercise by them of their powers under Part III of the principal Act, may, with the consent of the Local Government Board, and subject to such conditions (if any) as the Board may impose on giving their consent., dispense with any obligation of the local authority or any, other person to comply with any local Act, Provisional Order, or order having the effect of an Act, or any by-law, regulation, or other provision under whatever authority made, which is in operation in the area in which the local authority are exercising any of their powers under Part III of the principal Act, but nothing in this section shall confer upon any local authority power to dispense with the provisions of the London Building Acts, 1894 to 1905, or any Act amending the same, or any by-laws or regulations in force thereunder without the consent of the London County Council."</quote>
The object of the Amendment was, he explained, to facilitate the erection of houses for the working classes, and especially by the County Council of London. He felt in some difficulty about the clause as it had been placed upon the Paper. Those of their Lordships who had studied the Bill would have seen that under Clause 23 the Local Government Board sought to take powers in respect to Part I and Part II of the original Act which were identical with the power which he proposed to take under Part III by the suggested new clause. Again, under Clause 55 in the Town Planning Part more drastic provisions were proposed to be taken by the Local Government Board for overriding by-laws and Acts of Parliament than even were proposed in the Amendment he had placed upon the Paper. There were on that side of the House noble Lords who held, and he thought rightly held, that to give the Local Government, or any Government Department, the power of overriding either an Act of Parliament or a Provisional Order, was in itself an invasion of the usual practice of Parliament. It was highly desirable that anything which was done by Parliament, if it was to be abrogated, should be abrogated by Parliament. For these reasons, they were seeking to eliminate from Clause 23 and Clause 55 the provisions which would enable the Local Government Board to override anything except by-laws which they themselves had made.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0032"/>
<col>51</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00221">He proposed, with the consent of their Lordships, to amend his proposed new clause by leaving out those parts of it which referred to Acts of Parliament and limiting it to those parts which referred to the abrogation of by-laws with the consent of the Local Government Board which by-laws they themselves had made or had sanctioned. He had handed to the Lord Chairman such an Amendment as, without troubling their Lordships to read it, would reduce the clause precisely within those limits. He desired in a few words to explain why it was absolutely necessary, if housing was to be cheap, and if housing was also to be in any way expeditious, they should adopt some system of that kind, and bring into line the wholly divergent by-laws which existed throughout the metropolis, and, he believed, equally in some of the provincial towns. At that moment the London County Council had large building schemes which were being carried on, and necessarily carried on, outside the limits of the county. He would not trouble their Lordships at that moment although he might have to do so later on with any description of the position in which they stood with regard to those schemes <i>vis &#x00E2; vis</i> the Local Government Board, but he might mention that they carried them on under the greatest possible difficulties. For instance, in Croydon they came across by-laws which forced them to have in the rear of any building of that character a space of 500 square feet. In Edmonton they could erect exactly the same building with a space in the rear of it of 150 square feet. He thought their Lordships would admit that it was highly undesirable, if houses were needed for the working classes in the neighbourhood of Croydon, that such a penalty should be exacted from the ratepayers, unless it was the opinion of the Local Government Board that such a penalty must be exacted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00222">Then, again, Croydon required exactly double the width of a party wall to that required in the Borough of Tottenham, and there were conflicting by-laws throughout these boroughs as to drainage, the width of streets, the making of roads, the distances between cross roads, and so on. All those questions came up at intervals, after a site had been bought. They came up at a moment when the thing had been entered into in the belief that without cost to the ratepayers the dwellings could
<col>52</col>
be provided; and it was discovered, after action bad been taken, that owing to a by-law which might be adopted or changed by the local authority at any moment with the consent of the Local Government Board, the buildings had a very large increased cost put upon them. He would not for a moment press their Lordships upon the point were it one of those small and isolated cases to which allusion had been made in the course of the debate that afternoon, but he must say for the London County Council that for good or ill they had spent during the last ten years &#x00A3;2,560,000 on working class dwellings, and having had experience in different parts of the country of the difficulties raised by by-laws, he thought they had some right to ask their Lordships' indulgence in the matter. If the Local Government Board for the special object of workmen's dwellings saw reason to relapse by-laws which it had made itself, those by-laws should be so relapsed, and the penalty which at present was laid upon the ratepayers should not be exacted from them.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00224"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> hoped the noble Viscount would forgive him if he confessed himself at some disadvantage in arguing on an Amendment which had been amended since the present sitting of the House began. A good many of the questions they were dealing with were somewhat technical, and when an Amendment which was already of a technical nature was altered in that way, a layman like himself was in a considerable difficulty. First of all, with regard to the particular case which the noble Viscount had in his mind of Totten-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0033"/>
<col>53</col>
ham, Tottenham would be a very proper case for a town planning scheme, and that would come under different conditions which would probably meet the case of the noble Viscount. There was one result of the Amendment, as amended, which he thought was not in the mind of the noble Viscount, and that was that it would give to the Local Government Board the supervision of all the plans of the London County Council, which the Local Government Board were not anxious to have. There was one further point. The noble Viscount argued that the Bill went a great deal too far in giving to the Local Government Board certain powers in the way of repealing Acts of Parliament and by-laws. When they came to argue those clauses they would remember with pleasure that the noble Viscount himself suggested in the original form of his Amendment that the County Council should have power to override those Acts of Parliament, with the sanction of the Local Government Board. So that the noble Viscount himself went a very great deal further than anything which was in the Bill at the present time. He would draw the attention of the noble Viscount, if he might, to an Amendment which he had himself put down as a subsequent clause to Clause 44. After Clause 44 there was an Amendment standing in his name, and it gave power to the Local Government Board to override these by-laws and other enactments when they were unreasonable, and that Amendment might, perhaps, meet the case which the noble Viscount had quite fairly put to the Committee. In any event, he would like to suggest to him that, in view of the fact that none of their Lordships had seen the noble Viscount's Amendment, as now moved, in print, it would be well to bring it up again on Report. He hoped, however, that the noble Viscount would be satisfied with the subsequent Amendment to which he had referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00225"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> admitted that the noble Earl's suggested new clause did make a considerable difference. He had obtained a copy of it, but he had not had time to consider it fully. He would, with their Lordships' permission, withdraw his Amendment now and bring it up again on Report if it should be found that the noble Earl's Amendment did not sufficiently cover his own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00226"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> said that the question
<col>54</col>
of these building by-laws was one upon which he had been twice successful in asking their Lordships' House to pass a Bill, although, unfortunately, the Bill had gone no further than that House. The difficulties and troubles caused by unnecessary by-laws in rural districts had been so evident to the House on the two occasions on which he had had the honour to bring the subject before them that he thought there was really very little opposition on either side, and he had ventured to look upon the subject for some time as a little ewe lamb of his own. He was delighted to now find that it had been "gobbled up" by the Front Benches on both sides, the noble Viscount and the noble Earl in charge of the Bill having both put down Amendments on the subject. He would be only too thankful if he found, as a result of the two Front Benches having taken the matter up, that the difficulties and troubles and inconsistencies in the present by-laws of rural districts should be in any way obviated without his further troubling on the subject. But he would like to say that the President of the Local Government Board, after his (Lord Hylton's) Bill on the matter passed the House a year or two ago, spoke most sympathetically on the subject, and promised, if an opportunity provided itself, to father the measure through the House of Commons. That opportunity did not arise, but in a discussion upon this Bill the other day some Amendment of the kind was put down, and the President of the Local Government Board again said that if something was moved in this House he would again endeavour to give his attention to it. He would not repeat the arguments he used when he brought the subject before the House on a former occasion, but if the Front Benches were good enough to take the subject up he would only be too delighted to see it passed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00229"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved an Amendment to provide that the powers conferred on a tenant for life by the clause should not be exercised by him without the previous approval in writing of the trustees of the settlement. He was not quite sure what the intention of His Majesty's Government was in respect to the subsection&#x2014;subsection (2)&#x2014;to which his Amendment related. They evidently had in their minds some case which had been brought to their notice in which a tenant for life had built cottages and afterwards been called in question, he supposed, by his trustees, or some one interested, for having violated the terms of the settlement, or destroyed the amenities of the place or its surroundings. He had no doubt he would hear from the noble Earl the particular kind of case they had in mind. Of course the general tendency of legislation in recent years had been to free the tenant for life as much as possible and he was now, notwithstanding any terms of the settlement, allowed to use capital moneys for the building of cottages to the full extent he wished. But this went a step further, and said that when he was intent upon building cottages he was not to be restrained in any way whatever by any consideration, and wherever he built cottages, even if he built them opposite the front door of his mansion, and destroyed the garden, he was not to be called in question. That seemed to him to carry the freedom of the tenant for life too far, and his Amendment was merely to limit it to the extent that if the tenant for life wished to be absolutely protected so that he could build cottages precisely where he thought fit, he must first get the consent of his trustees. It seemed to him to be a very moderate Amendment, and he hoped the Government would accept it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00231"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he would not venture to accuse any noble Lord or landowner of doing anything so foolish as to build cottages opposite his front door. He thought the provisions of the clause were fairly simple in their intention. The idea was that they should simplify the matter and assist any tenant for life in building such cottages if he wished to do so. His own experience was that the less one had to deal with lawyers the better, and in the case before them the intervention of the trustees would, without any doubt, give an opportunity to the family lawyer to have something to say in the matter. No doubt the noble Marquess was afraid that some unwise tenant for life might erect needless dwellings on the estate which the man who succeeded afterwards would be obliged to keep in repair, but he did not think that that would be likely to happen. One reason why he thought it was not very likely to happen was that the tenant for life would have to spend his own money in the matter, and therefore he was not likely to waste, it needlessly, or spend it in the erection of unnecessary buildings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00232"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> was of opinion that the words went too far. He had known cases where a malicious man, a tenant for life, had seriously injured the property by spending money needlessly, because he was unfriendly to those coming after him; and he thought that there ought to be some protection in regard to the estate itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00233"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> hoped the House would agree to the Amendment of the noble Marquess. It did seem to him that the protection of the trustees in such a case would be valuable. He believed there was a safeguard where it was proposed to spend capital money for the building of workmen's cottages, and that was that a scheme had to be submitted through the intermediary of the Board of Agriculture. It so happened that he himself had had to inquire into that very matter in a small case in which he was interested only that day, and he was told that it was in most cases obligatory for the scheme to be adopted.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00268"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved the omission of the words "or Part III," the effect being to take away from the Local Government Board the power to force any local authority by <i>mandamus</i> to embark on a housing scheme. Even if the Amendment were accepted it would, he said, leave the Local Government Board full powers over a local authority for the execution of Part I and Part II of the principal Act. Those two Parts dealt really with all the important public health matters in Housing Acts. They would enable the Local Government Board to force a local authority to deal with all the existing evils which were inseparable from unhealthy dwellings and insanitary areas. They would be able to force them to deal with plague spots of congested areas and destroy, remove, or reconstruct slum districts. He was bound to say that he believed with regard to those two Parts of the prinicipal Act that that power of the Local Government Board was absolutely necessary. It was given under the Act of 1903, and now it was strengthened by the larger powers of complaint and representation which were given to the local authorities and to the inhabitants. He believed it was necessary because the existence of these congested areas they all acknowledged and deplored, and he thought they were a proof that many local authorities were exceedingly apathetic in carrying out the duties placed upon them by former Acts of Parliament. It was, perhaps, rather a curious fact that slums existed in almost as great a degree as they did twenty years ago; and when it was shown by clear evidence that the need of action and of compelling power on the part of the Local Government Board over a local authority was really a necessity, however much they disagreed with the general idea of a Government Department compelling a popularly elected body to act contrary to its wishes,
<col>62</col>
he was bound to say they ought to extend the fullest power to a Government Department to deal with it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00269">The Government, he thought, had shown in their Bills that they were too ready to insert this power of <i>mandamus</i> with respect to local bodies. It was a principle which he believed was fundamentally wrong, and if carried to an extreme it was liable to make a farce of all local government. It could only be tolerated, in his opinion, if a really clear case was made out for its use. He believed that a clear case had been made for full powers with regard to Parts I and II. He did not wish to raise any objection to it in this section, but he thought the matter was quite different with regard to Part III. He had referred so much to Part II because he wanted, if he could, to draw a really broad distinction between the duties which fell on local authorities under Part II and the duties which would now fall upon them under Part III. In the former case the duties which the local authority had to carry out were duties which touched the health and the lives of the people in the localities under their charge. They were essentially local duties. But with regard to Part III, the dealing with housing schemes was certainly not a primary duty of a local authority. It was certainly not their first duty to suddenly embark on housing schemes or housing speculation; that was not a matter which affected public health in anything like the same degree as demolition or reconstruction schemes. It was really an extension of a very large measure of social reform which was not of local importance so much as of really national importance, and no evidence could be brought forward that local authorities had failed to carry out their duties in that respect, because up to the present Part III of the Act had been purely adoptive and local authorities had not been compelled to take it up at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00270">He thought it was obvious that any housing scheme must be an expensive scheme, and must be a burden on the rates. They knew perfectly well that in building houses, at all events in rural districts, it was quite impossible to let them at a rent which would repay interest and sinking fund alone. He admitted fully that in urban districts rents were on a higher level than they were in rural districts. Local authorities had the increased powers of borrowing which were given them under the Act, and he under
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0038"/>
<col>63</col>
stood that those powers would enable them to borrow money and pay off and set aside a sinking fund at the rate of three and a-quarter per cent. He admitted that there would be a better opportunity in urban districts than in rural districts, and he had no doubt that the President of the Local Government Board was perfectly justified on the Second Reading of the Bill in another place in showing that he could build and let a house at a rent which would repay interest and sinking fund. But it was well known to their Lordships that before a scheme could be self-supporting it was essential not only that one should be able to repay the interest and the sinking fund, but that one should be able to keep up one's buildings and do everything else that was necessary as a householder. First of all, obviously they had to keep the buildings in repair. He would like to say one word upon the percentage of cost of repairs. Formerly, under Schedule A of Income Tax, landowners were allowed sixteen per cent., roughly speaking one-sixth of the rent, as a reduction from their income for the cost of repairs. He was glad to say they knew, or had heard, that it had been acknowledged that landowners had been overtaxed in that respect, and there was to be an amendment put down in another place raising the limit of the cost of repairs to twenty-five per cent., or one-fourth. He understood that that was to be in special cases, but of course they did not know the details yet. He was sure, however, that landowners would be grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for that concession, and although it did not go as far as they thought necessary. at the same time he congratulated Lord Onslow and his association for the trouble taken and for the figures they collected and were able to put before the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But whether it was one-fifth or one-fourth, it was a very large item which had to come off the rent of the building.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00271">In addition there were the rates, which added a large sum, and there was also the cost of insurance and the very large risk, which was a real and a certain risk with that class of houses, that there would be arrears of rent which it was impossible to collect. To give their Lordships some idea of what that amounted to he would like to say that in connection with another Bill which had been before their Lordships particulars of the amount
<col>64</col>
of arrears of rent of certain property were furnished to him from the City of Edinburgh which showed that in the case of houses let at &#x00A3;6 the average percentage of arrears was thirty-three per cent. of the rental, and in the case of houses let at &#x00A3;7 the average percentage was twenty-five per cent. of the rental. When they added all those items together it was perfectly obvious that a housing scheme carried on by a local authority could not be self-supporting. It was essential that it should be a very heavy burden upon the rates. They need have no doubt that the experiment would be a costly one, and he did not believe it was right that a Government Department, which had no responsibility whatever for the rates, should have the power of forcing upon a popularly elected body that which would amount to a large scheme of municipal trading at the cost of the rates without the approval of that local authority, and without the consent of the constituents who elected that local authority. If they took away from the Local Government Board the power of forcing local authorities to carry out housing schemes there remained some machinery in the Bill by which those housing duties could be carried out if the rural authority was remiss in its duty. Section 12 of the Bill provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"If the council of a county on the complaint of the parish council or parish meeting of any parish comprised in any rural district in the county, or of any four inhabitant householders of that district, after holding a local inquiry are satisfied that the rural district council have failed to exercise their powers under Part III of the principal Act in cases where those powers ought to have been exercised, the county council may resolve that the powers of the district council for the purposes of that Part be transferred to the county council."</quote>
That made the county council the judge of whether the schemes were required or whether they were necessary, and he personally believed the county council to be the proper authority in the matter because they were representative of the county and of the district, and they had also not only full knowledge of local requirements but had a certain responsibility for the rates. He thought it was more consonant with their ideas of local government that the county council should remain the chief authority in that respect. Of course, that section only referred to rural districts. But in order that some power should be brought in to force an urban district which was remiss in carrying out its duties in the same way as a rural district he had put Amendments

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00273"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the practical effect of the Amendment, taken in conjunction with later Amendments, was to remove the authority of the Local Government Board with regard to Part III, and to substitute instead the action under Clause 12, in which case the county council would have authority both over the urban and the rural district councils. That was an alternative to the present scheme. Their Lordships knew that powers were given under Clause 12 already to deal with rural districts; by the Amendment of the noble Lord he would also put urban districts under the power of the county council. The town councils and also the urban district councils had both objected very strongly to the interposition of any authority between themselves and the Board, and by removing the urban district councils out of Clause 10 and putting them into Clause 12 they were left without any appeal to the Local Government Board. They preferred to be in direct communication with the Local Government Board. Where members of urban district councils had gathered together resolutions had been carried urging that no clause should be passed inserting any authority between themselves and the Local Government Board. He would further point out that there was no precedent to empower what was proposed by the Amendment. It would be taking a very strong step to put urban councils under the same power as rural councils. The County Councils Association might be against their proposal and desire that complaints should be to them as regards boroughs and urban districts; but as to smaller urban districts the Amendment of the noble Lord went much further. One effect of the Amendment would be that there would be no power to deal with default on the part of county boroughs at all; it would not apply to county boroughs; they would have to be mentioned separately. It was a very serious matter. His Majesty's Government thought the Bill as introduced provided better machinery, and he hoped their Lordships would allow the Bill to stand as it was.</p>
<col>66</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00274"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> did not think the noble Earl realised the strength of the noble Lord's point. Was it to be agreed in that House that any local authority, however important it might be, was to be subject to the Local Government Board in a matter that involved very heavy expenditure of the ratepayers' money? It was not a case of bad dwellings, because that belonged to Parts I and II of the principal Act with which they were not dealing. They were dealing with cases under Part III, namely, that part of the principal Act which provided machinery for dealing with a new land scheme; and the question was whether important bodies like the county councils and county borough councils, elected expressly to protect the interests of ratepayers, were to be subject to a decree of the Local Government Board sitting in London as to how they were to expend the money of their constituents. It seemed to him to be a negation of local government as they understood it. It was astonishing to find the Liberal Party, which was so much in favour of representative self-government, proposing that representative bodies should have their decisions overridden by a Public Department in London. He did not think, whatever the fate of the noble Lord's Amendment might be, that their Lordships could assent to the extreme doctrine the Government had put forward. Therefore, even if the noble Lord did not press his Amendment it would be for their Lordships to consider the Amendment standing in the name of Lord Midleton, by which he would exempt from the operation of this Clause as affecting Part III of the Act the county councils and the great county boroughs. The noble Earl, in the speech he had just delivered, seemed to think that the county boroughs wanted control. Their Lordships could not assent to that. The noble Earl not only dealt with county boroughs, he also spoke of smaller urban constituencies. There was a recognised distinction between the two, and that distinction had been emphasised by Lord St. Aldwyn. In the face of that distinction he (Lord Salisbury) thought some of their Lordships could hardly support Lord Clinton in the Amendment he had laid before them. But although they could not go so far as to strike out "or Part III," it would need a certain amount of protection, and their Lordships would find on page 5 of the Paper an Amendment standing in
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0040"/>
<col>67</col>
the name of Lord St. Aldwyn which proposed to re-instate the conditions which prevailed as to limiting the action of the county council under the existing Housing Acts in order to limit the action of the Local Government Board in respect of this Housing Act. That Amendment only dealt with rural districts. If Lord St. Aldwyn was prepared to extend it to small communities besides rural districts there would be sufficient protection, and then it would not be necessary to insist on so drastic an Amendment as that proposed by Lord Clinton. If they were not able to go with Lord Clinton on this Amendment it must be understood that they reserved the right to support the other Amendment in the form which he had ventured to mention.</p>

The first point of the noble Marquess's speech was directed against Clause 1 of the Bill. His objection was that Part III should be otherwise than adoptive. The particular question of whether Part III is compulsory is to be inquired into, but the point before your Lordships is the general question of compelling a local burden under Part III at all. Therefore it does not seem to be entirely relevant. I suggest that if the Amendment is not going to be pressed it would be better to reserve the discussion until the other Amendments are considered in due course. As regards the question of the noble Duke, I did not understand my noble friend behind me to say that county boroughs desired to come under the Local Government Board.

ALDWYN</member> moved the omission from the clause of the words "or, if the Board think fit, in any case where the authority in default is the council of a county district, the county council." He said this clause proposed in the first place that the complaint should be made by the county council that the council of a rural or urban district had not carried out the provisions of the law, and then that the Local Government Board on such complaint might make an order requiring the local authority to carry out the law. In line 37, other words were inserted which did not apply to the local authority at all. He did not quite understand what they meant. The words were&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board may declare the authority to be in default and may make an order directing that authority, or, if the Board think fit, in any case where the authority in default is the council of a county district, the county council."</quote>
What right had the Local Government Board, either as the law stood or as it would stand if the Bill passed in its present shape, to make an order directing a county council to carry out the law? The county council was not the local authority for the purposes of this Bill. A county council as a county council was not charged by Parliament with any duty at all, except so far as the duties imposed upon it by that section were concerned which depended on the council's complaint, application, or consent; and, also, any action under Clauses 11 and 12 of the Bill must be initiated by the county council or with the consent of the county council. Therefore he thought he was right in urging that neither the existing law nor the Bill imposed any obligation on a county council to carry out the Housing Acts. Then, he asked, what right had the Local Government Board to make an order on a county council to do it? He did not understand how those words had crept into the clause, and as he did not think the Local Government Board ought to have the right to make any such order on

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00286"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> moved that before deciding that a local authority had failed to exercise their powers under Part III of the principal Act the Board should be satisfied that there was a necessity which was likely to be permanent for further housing accommodation for the working classes, that there was no probability that it would be otherwise provided, and that, having regard to the liability which would be incurred by the rates, it was prudent to undertake the provision. He stated that under the Act of 1890 it was provided that where a county council applied Part III of the Housing Act to a rural district it should only do so after having before it certain considerations, and having arrived at a conclusion upon them. Those considerations were practically what had been placed in the Amendment. That provision, when the Act of 1893 extended the powers of the county council in the matter, was reinstated, and it now stood as the law. The powers proposed by the clause to be conferred on the Local Government Board of making an order to compel a rural district council to provide this accommodation, of course, were far in excess of the powers granted by Parliament to the county councils in the matter of merely making Part III operative in a district. Therefore there was all the more reason for re-enacting a similar provision with
<col>70</col>
regard to the action of the Local Government Board in the matter. Before making the Order, which might be the cause of great expenditure, there should be considered whether accommodation should be provided, whether there was any probability that it would be otherwise provided, and whether it would be wise, having regard to the rates that it should be undertaken. Any one who knew the country knew many cases where, because of some particular trade or industry, dwellings had been built for the working classes, and perhaps within a few years, owing to the disappearance of the trade or industry, those buildings had become useless. They were bound, he thought, to provide by Statute that the Local Government Board should have before it precisely the same considerations as by the existing laws were before the county council prior to making orders,</p>

The necessities of the case were met by the provision that there should be a local inquiry. After the local inquiry it might be found that the local authority was in default in some cases, and that there were some cases in which they ought to have exercised their power. The Local Government Board would not say they ought to have exercised their power if there was no necessity for further accommodation, or there was a probability that further accommodation would be provided. But other points ought to be considered by the Board, and it was not necessary to lay emphasis on one or two points when they would have to consider others later on. There was really no point of difference between the noble Viscount and himself.</p>

The noble Earl tells us that the words proposed to be inserted by my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn are superfluous, because we may assume that through the local inquiries contemplated by the Bill safeguards will have been sufficiently provided. I am totally unconvinced by the arguments of the noble Earl. Let us consider what this clause is really going to do. We are going to allow a Government Department to coerce a local authority into the expenditure of large sums of money, sums which may be very large in some cases, and which may be, very likely would be, spent for unremunerative purposes. Is it not reasonable that we should safeguard that power by every means at our disposal, and is it not perfectly reasonable to insist that those considerations which under the existing law have to be taken into account before Part III of the principal Act can be applied should be duly considered and weighed by those who are responsible?

It appeared that Part I of the Housing Act dealing with large improvements enabled twelve householders to initiate proceedings and provided for security for costs to be lodged. His Amendment would extend to the case where initiatory action was taken by four men, who sometimes might be very worthy men and who sometimes might be very unworthy, and it seemed a pity that a burden should be placed on the ratepayers' shoulders unless those four men gave security for costs.

The Local Government Board were to override an authority which had been elected to represent the ratepayers, and to order them to spend the rates in defiance of what they thought right, and the Government did not propose to give them any appeal from that whatever. The Local Government Board were to have absolute authority. When the noble Earl objected to Lord Clinton's Amendment, they expected that if those local authorities were to be kept under the Local Government Board in regard to Part III they should have an appeal of some sort or kind. That was highly desirable. When the noble Earl said the Local Government Board were only acting administratively, he supposed a schoolmaster only acted administratively when he flogged a boy. He should say they were acting not only administratively but judicially. The Local Government Board had to satisfy themselves that the local authority had failed to exercise their powers under Part II or Part III of the principal Act in cases where those powers ought to have been exercised. In whose opinion was that? It was in the opinion of the Local Government Board. Surely that was exercising judicial powers. They took upon themselves to decide that the local authority had not done what it ought to have done, and the noble Earl proposed that the unfortunate local authority was to have no appeal of any sort against them, but that the word of the Board was to be law.

That may be so; I cannot say. I am bound to say, having regularly attended the sittings of the House during the current session, that although I might be impressed by the burden of labour that has been put on the noble Earl I do not think noble Lords generally have so far found attendance at this House during this session a very onerous affair. The noble Earl and the noble Viscount who moved this Amendment think it necessary that there should be this safeguard with regard to the action of the Local Government Board, and my noble friend behind me pointed out that in the first place it would, or might, at any rate, carry with it considerable delay. That does not appeal to the noble Duke opposite, and in the particular instance he gave delay would not be so urgent as it might be in other particular parts of the Bill. At the same time if I were a workman wanting a house I should consider a delay of nine months or a year no light affair. But I attach more importance to the other set of considerations. What is the exact value of this appeal, if appeal it is to be? What is to happen? A particular district is found by the Local Government Board to be in default in this matter of housing. I quite agree with the noble Earl that that is in the nature of a judicial decision. Is it the proper appeal from a judicial decision that the Order should be on the Table of your Lordships' House? What possible means has this House of forming an opinion on the matter? Take a concrete case. A particular district in England or Scotland comes under this ban of the Local Government Board. By what conceivable means is the majority of your Lordships' House to find out, if the Order was on the Table, whether the Local Government Board has put a correct interpretation on the facts?

If the appeal took the form of the Order lying on the Table of the House they all knew there was very little risk of Parliament interfering with the Executive; but, on the other hand, there was very great danger of the Executive interfering with Parliament, and that was occurring more frequently every year. He hardly remembered a case in which a Peer or a member of the other House had taken up those cases without having some really good ground to go upon. He thought the more responsible people in their Lordships' House were not likely to do so, and if any irresponsible people did so the thing was not very likely to succeed. It would be some protection. As the noble Earl had asked him a question, he would reply by asking the noble Earl one.

The noble Earl, as I understand, raises two objections to the Amendment of my noble friend. He says, in the first place, the procedure would perhaps occasion delay, but I noticed he was not inclined to drive that argument home. He evidently realised that an argument founded on delay was not a very serious argument, and it cannot be a very serious argument. He began with the delay; if delay occurs at all it will probably take place at a season of the year when building operations are not likely to be pursued with much activity. Apart from that, which is the greater evil&#x2014;that there should be a delay of a few weeks or months on the one hand, or that this matter of public importance should be dealt with over the heads of the public authorities and without any regard to the interests of the ratepayers?

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00309">is the other argument? That Parliament is not a very appropriate court of appeal for a purpose of this kind, and that the mere laying of the scheme on the Table of the Houses of Parliament would not effectually protect the interests we desire to protect. But I can conceive no form of appeal more efficient than that the scheme should lie on the Table of the two Houses and be dealt with in the light of day. It is usual for great charitable schemes to lie on the Table of the Houses of Parliament for our consideration, and when we are told that local inquiry is sufficient to give us all we require may we not recur to that well known case&#x2014;the Swansea case&#x2014;when a local inquiry took place, where the Department ignored the result of the inquiry, and were taken to task for their conduct by a Court of Justice? I have heard nothing to convince me that the proposal of my noble friend is an unreasonable one. I hope he will press his Amendment, and I shall certainly go with him into the Lobby.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00312">[<i>The sitting was suspended at 8 o'clock and resumed at</i> 9.15.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00313"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> moved an Amendment to exclude from the scope of Clause 10 the London County Council or the council of any large borough. He said the Amendment raised in reality a question which was vital to the whole conduct of the Bill. In the course of a brief discussion before dinner their Lordships had had placed before them on several occasions a feeling which was strongly held on that side of the House and was also strongly held in the country&#x2014;that it was an anomaly first to set to work to appoint representative authorities, and after having trusted them with powers for a very long period to suddenly arrive at the proposition that their authority and jurisdiction should be usurped by a Government Department. He had served long enough in Government Departments to hold the highest respect for the officials who conducted the business of those Departments, but at the same time he could not help feeling that whilst it would be perfectly reasonable in this country for the Secretary for the Colonies to assume the power of being not merely master in his own house, but of withdrawing his decisions from the authority of Parliament undoubtedly only for a time would a free hand be given. They had had quoted instances of how almost inevitably these matters worked when the uncontrolled authority of Ministers, however good, was put into contradistinction against the authority of Parliament from which such authority emanated, and to which they were bound to render an account; and he could not help thinking that in all the Departments which they had, with Presidents holding established ideas of the Constitution, this Department which was now set on foot was one of the greatest. He had been most anxious to avoid troubling their Lordships on a previous Amendment with the full force of the arguments which might have been brought to bear upon it,
<col>80</col>
because he knew that he should have to produce them on this Amendment, which he believed to be one of the most important. He did not suppose any member of that House who had not taken part in local government in one of our great towns or cities could realise the full force of what it was proposed to do by the Bill, even after the Amendment which had been passed au hour before.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00314">He would take the case of the London County Council, an assembly which had not an exaggerated opinion of the decisions of their predecessors. The London County Council spent &#x00A3;2,650,000 upon the housing of the working classes under Part III of the original Act. When the present Council were elected the late Council had bought a very large estate in the North of London, an estate of between 400 and 500 acres of valuable land at a cost of some &#x00A3;400 per acre. They had acquired estates north south, east and west with a view to establishing a large number of municipal dwellings and lodging houses for the working classes. The election which was taken two and a-half years ago was decided mainly on the extravagance of the previous Council, based on the assumption, rightly or wrongly, that they had misinterpreted the views of the ratepayers of London, and an emphatic verdict was given in favour of economy. Upon that verdict the present Council undertook to act without the least desire to impede the legitimate demands for housing the people. There was no attempt to frustrate by sudden action the whole process of housing of the working classes, nor endeavour to reduce what had been done by their predecessors to failure by neglect to continue building on those sites, which, without that continuance, must have proved to be a failure from a pecuniary point of view. But it remained that the present Council were prepared to spend &#x00A3;800,000 in continuing or completing to a large extent some of the plans laid down whilst adding materially to the large number of empty
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0047"/>
<col>81</col>
dwellings. He had been over sites where the London County Council were building in streets where private individuals had erected houses and were utterly unable to find a market for them because the London County Council could afford, with the ratepayers' money, to build the same class of houses and let them on better terms. Rows of houses built by private individuals remained empty, while the London County Council continued to build streets of houses in order, not to provide for existing needs, but to continue the policy laid down by their predecessors.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00315">Up to the present moment the ratepayers had been able to express their own views, but now a totally different procedure was proposed. The President of the Local Government Board, of whom he spoke with the utmost respect, held strong views in the interest of those who had opposed the present London County Council which was elected by the votes of five millions of the population at the last election. He was at the Local Government Board and still held the views which stimulated those who had been displaced; his whole policy during the last two and a-half years had been to try and force upon the Council by every means in his power the continued expenditure of one and a-half million of the ratepayers' money which the ratepayers had decided they would not spend. In the Bill as it stood there was nothing to prevent four householders, who might include the butler and coachman of any two gentlemen, or anybody not necessarily paying rates, having it in their power to bring before the Local Government Board the necessity of carrying out the scheme of the previous Council, and the London County Council must appoint an inquiry and name an arbitrator to say whether he was satisfied that it was desirable to continue the old policy. What was the use of the whole principle of local self-government that had been established in this country if after the deliberate vote cast by a great mass of ratepayers, the opinion of one man, however honestly held, was allowed, without any appeal to their Lordships and only upon his <i>ipse dixit,</i> to overrule it? He did not believe that men would be content to spend the hours they had to spend in carrying out the unpaid functions connected with local government if at the last moment they were allowed to be overruled by a Government Department. They had spent many hours
<col>82</col>
in the London County Council, day after day, in considering how to cut down without loss to the ratepayers the scheme from two and a-half millions to one and a-half million, and any one who had to deal with the matter knew how difficult it had been in the past to do the best for those they represented. But under the present Bill all discretion disappeared and a local inquiry would be ordered to deal with the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00316">The point he desired to raise clearly was whether the system of the subordination of local authorities to the Local Government Board was to be carried, not merely in the case of London but also in the cases of Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and other great authorities of the country. He did not personally like the system under which any local authority might be forced to carry out its sanitary duties, or be coerced from dealing with the funds of the ratepayers in an unwise manner. Whilst, however, he accepted the system in those respects he would be personally glad if the Local Government Board could not intervene in other matters of local government, because he thought that the ability of the ratepayers to spend money in their own discretion ought to be secured to them. If they were to make any distinction they should make it so that the public would overcome the private interest. One could conceive the cases of towns where a small group of individuals might control the whole town. They might have great powers on a small borough council and might be able to secure that the development of the town should be arrested; but it was impossible to attribute the same power to great municipalities like Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool, where there was no danger of anything of the sort.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00317">As an instance of what occurred in London he would take the case of Woolwich. The Marquess of Lansdowne would remember what pressure was brought to bear upon the War Office when the population of Woolwich was largely increased and when during the war in South Africa the number of persons employed at Woolwich rose from 10,000 to 21,000. There was the greatest possible pressure put upon them to provide housing accommodation, but it was met by the War Office paving higher wages in order to enable men to come by tram or rail from a distance instead of over-stocking, to meet an emergency, the local market for housing
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0048"/>
<col>83</col>
the people. That emergency only existed four or five years, and if during that period the Local Government Board had been called upon by four householders at Woolwich they would have built at the expanse of the ratepayers a large number of houses without hearing the argument that in five years time the demand for the extra housing accommodation would have entirely disappeared. What would have been the position now that the number of <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> at Woolwich had been reduced from 21,000 to 8,000? The older houses would have been deserted in order that the more popular and newer houses might be taken. He maintained that the War Office adopted the right course in paying higher wages to bring workmen from a distance, and that the ratepayers were saved from an enormous sum being put into an unnecessary industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00318">The noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, would doubtless tell them that no one would be so foolish as to adopt any course but that which was pursued in the case of Woolwich, but they had heard some remarks about enthusiasm, and he was quite certain that if they looked upon this question without taking instances, but simply from the point of view of how it would be regarded by all those who had respect for our municipal representative system, they would feel that it was a vicious and retrograde system to in any way overcome the actual votes of the ratepayers by the opinion of any individual, however distinguished a representative of a Government Department he might be; and he would urge upon their Lordships to consider what was the fairest method in which they could limit the Bill. He did not believe for one moment that it would be considered reasonable to interfere with what had hitherto been an optional service and regulate the provision of workmen's dwellings, not because of the displacement of the population for public improvement, but apparently to provide fresh dwellings of a good character for a deserving class of persons. It would not be considered reasonable for that to be enforced in the case of large municipalities, however necessary it might be in small districts in which a small group of individuals might have special power of going against an Act of Parliament. The Amendment limited the scope to county boroughs, but as he did not wish to be tied to that, because perhaps the Govern-
<col>84</col>
ment oath might regard it as too wide and think that the great boroughs outside London would be sufficient, he proposed to put in the Amendment words providing that it related only to Part III of the principal Act, He hoped that he would not be unreasonable in thinking that if the Bill was to be applied to the whole of Great Britain&#x2014;to the London County Council as well as the great boroughs&#x2014;it would be an anomaly and create a great injustice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00319">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 5, line 19, after the word 'mandamus' to insert the following new subsection:</quote>
<quote>'(5) For the purposes of this section so far as it relates to Part III of the principal Act, the expression 'local authority' shall not include the London County Council, or the council of any county borough.'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Midleton.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00320"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the noble Viscount had referred to the valuable work performed by the borough councils, but the main portion of his speech was really devoted to the London County Council. He was sure that no member of their Lordships' House would be anxious to underrate the valuable services which the London County Council had rendered to the citizens of that county, but the Amendment of the noble Viscount went a great deal further and included all county boroughs throughout the country. Lord Midleton was mistaken if he thought it was the intention or desire of the Local Government Board to usurp the functions laid upon the county boroughs and the London County Council by Parliament. Nothing would please the Local Government Board better than to feel that there was no necessity to take action under this section against either the London County Council or the county boroughs. But while they recognised that the Local Government Board would be most anxious not to take action, and that nothing would please them more than to feel that sufficient action had already been taken under the Act, the requirements of the working classes in their own areas had to be considered. The noble Viscount had referred to the case of Woolwich, and had spoken of them as enthusiasts. Just before dinner Lord St. Aldwyn, apparently on the suggestion he (Earl Beauchamp) had made, agreed to an Amendment which would exactly fit the case of Woolwich because it provided for the gyrations of the population. Viscount Midleton had characterised the proposal of the Bill to override the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0049"/>
<col>85</col>
wishes of the people as vicious and retrograde, and when other Bills came before the House he hoped the noble Viscount would remember that phrase because it was not unlikely to be quoted against him and his Party. In any case this Amendment went a great deal further than the Government could possibly accept, and he regretted that he could not agree on behalf of the Local Government Board to the insertion of the proposed new subsection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00321"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> pointed out that although Earl Beauchamp had suggested that the argument of the noble Viscount was directed more to the London County Council than to the councils of county boroughs, his own speech did not touch the London County Council except so far as it referred to the Amendment which the Government were unable to accept. Reference had been made to the case of Woolwich, and he was sure the noble Earl would admit that it would have been absurd for the President of the Local Government Board to enforce his will on the London County Council under such circumstances. With regard to the metropolis, he could almost claim the assent of the Government to the proposal of the Amendment. But would they not go further and extend it to the great communities of Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool, which held a peculiar and unique position among the municipalities of the country? Would it not be almost absurd for the President of the Local Government Board to dictate to the county council of these great communities what they should do with regard to the carrying out of Part III of the Act? He was of opinion that the noble Viscount had gone rather far in including all the county boroughs within the scope of his Amendment, but he hoped the Government might be disposed to agree to the Amendment if it was limited.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00322"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think we must all agree that there is&#x2014;and I frankly admit it&#x2014;a distinction which can fairly be drawn between such bodies as the London County Council and the small county boroughs which by the noble Viscount's Amendment would be included; but at the same time I am afraid there is a general difference of view between noble Lords opposite and ourselves on this
<col>86</col>
matter. With regard to the question of Part III being of the same nature as those sanitary Acts under which the Local Government Board have compulsory powers, the noble Viscount draws a sharp line. He will admit that in questions of sewage, water supply, and similar matters it might be necessary from time to time to use the compulsory powers of a Government Department obtained under the Public Health and other Acts. He probably knows there have been cases where these powers have been applied to county boroughs. Well in our view the case under Part III is of the same nature and quite as important in the public interest as those of other public bodies. There are very large numbers of people who regard sewage and water supply schemes as extravagancies and luxuries. There are in London thousands of people who consider a great system of drainage in the light of what they would call "utter rubbish," and say that after all people got on very well before and they did not die, and all these extravagant schemes are great nonsense. That would apply in a. still greater degree to this housing provision. I am not in a position to say what my right hon. friend will be able to do or whether he can do anything with regard to meeting the noble Viscount in this matter. As I understand it, Lord St. Aldwyn would be prepared to limit the application of the Amendment to London and some of the great cities which are in themselves counties, and he would advise the noble Viscount to withdraw that part of his Amendment which includes all borough counties. I will see that my right hon. friend is apprised of that before the Report stage, but I am afraid that I cannot give a definite answer at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00323"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said it was a matter of regret to those sitting on that side of the House that the noble Earl could not speak more definitely as to what the Government would do to meet the Amendment of the noble Viscount. The noble Earl must recognise the weakness of the argument he had just addressed to the House. He had dwelt upon sanitary and other provisions that it had been found necessary to see carried out even in large urban communities by invoking the central authority; but the argument could not be put forward in this instance unless cases were produced in which there had been shown to be failure to provide sufficient
**<image src="S5LV0003P0I0050"/>
<col>87</col>
housing accommodation. The Bill had been considered for many months, and the Government must have had all the facts in their hands. Could they say that in great communities like Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham there was a great want of housing accommodation which the authorities had been unwilling to remedy? The Committee knew that in Birmingham great changes had been made in order to meet these requirements, and the same rule doubtless would apply to Manchester and Liverpool. Speaking for himself, he saw no choice but to put the Amendment in the Bill and if the Government did not agree to modify it as suggested by Lord St. Aldwyn let them provide their own modification.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00324"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that as he understood it the argument in favour of the Amendment was twofold. It was, in the first instance, that to give this power to the Local Government Board was wholly unnecessary bcause the excellent local bodies did the work already. That might be the case, but the time might arrive when the Local Government Board would be anxious to have the necessary power in order to hold it over those bodies who declined to act. The other part of the argument was that a system of <i>mandamus</i> was not one which could be employed against large local authorities duly elected by ratepayers and occupying an important position. He would remind noble Lords opposite that a system of <i>mandamus</i> was put by themselves into their own Education Act, and was a leading feature of their Defaulting Authorities Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00325"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I understand the noble Earl in charge of the Bill to say, in the first place, that the Local Government Board have no wish to usurp the functions of the larger urban municipalities, but he has just told us that what the Government desire to obtain is the power to hold over these large municipalities this departmental sword, which may fall upon their necks at any moment. That is exactly the point on which we join issue with the Government. In our view these larger urban municipal bodies may fairly claim to enjoy a certain amount of independence and I think we may claim, as the noble Earl who leads the House is quite ready to admit, there is a large distinction between the London County Council and the larger municipalities, and the smaller county councils. If that is so we surely might be
<col>88</col>
able to come to terms. The difference is inconsiderable, and I venture to suggest that the noble Earl might accept the Amendment with the qualifying words limiting it to Part III of the Bill, and give to these great municipal bodies to which we have delegated a large measure of self-government the advantages of that decentralisation which noble Lords opposite have most strenuously advocated.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>(2) Any order made by the Local Government Board under this section may be enforced by mandamus.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00329"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> moved to add a proviso at the end of the first subsection, which provision, he said, was really brought forward in the interest of the progress of the Bill. At present it was not in the power of the Local Government Board by its own initiative to force any municipality beyond a certain strength, without reference to Parliament, to build houses under Part III of the Bill, although they had power of displacement in sanitary cases to force the erection of dwellings. The difficulty in which they were placed would be found if any great scheme were brought forward by the London County Council or by a large borough, either for railway or tramway purposes or for the building of a large bridge, because a large displacement of the population then necessarily occurred. The Local Government Board urged that the population must be replaced on or near to the site, but meanwhile by voluntary action much larger provision might be made within a distance of two or three miles to which those driven out might migrate. It would be found that when under a Government Order the houses on or ear the site were rebuilt no one went back, and very often the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0051"/>
<col>89</col>
houses were left vacant for a long period of time. What he asked by the Amendment was that in the case of any municipality that voluntarily entered upon a large scheme and possessed in the borough a large number of houses which practically gave the accommodation that was required, the Local Government Board should not then come forward and say that, although it was quite true that the accommodation was provided, two months had been lost in carrying out the scheme and the houses must be replaced. The Amendment had been very moderately drawn and he asked the Government to consider it. He believed it would not prevent any single individual obtaining housing accommodation whilst it would enable local bodies to voluntarily enter into schemes under Part III of the Bill&#x2014;a course they could not at present pursue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00330">Amendment moved&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00331"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the Government were unable to accept the Amendment, which really confused two different sets of circumstances. In the event of displacement of dwelling houses in connection with any scheme the London County Council or other authority concerned were bound to make provision for the people so displaced. That was one set of circumstances. But in addition there was the other set which related to dwellings to be erected more especially in connection with the Bill before the House. One set had little or nothing to do with the other. If houses were necessary for the working classes it was generally agreed that they ought to be built, and if there was displacement owing to some reconstruction scheme then houses ought to be erected for those people who were displaced. They, however, were quite a different set of people from those dealt with under re-housing, which was the object of the Bill. Supposing there were any unforeseen circumstances which rendered necessary some alternative scheme. There
<col>90</col>
were already provisions to meet special circumstances, and he ventured to submit that it would hardly be right to count upon the erection of houses which were being put up to meet one set of circumstances as being sufficient not only to re-house those displaced, but also to meet the original needs which the first scheme was intended to meet. As there already existed this special provision he hoped the noble Viscount would be satisfied and not press the motion.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00341"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> hoped he might be able to make this complicated point clear. This was a case where a county council were anxious to take over the powers which now belonged to the rural district council. The position of His Majesty's Government in this case was that if the county council desired to take over those powers they ought to pay for it themselves. If the rural district council were in default then the Government were of opinion that the question as to who should pay or whether part of the expenses should be upon the rural district council which was in default was a matter which might fairly be argued. That was dealt with in a subsequent clause, but the present case was that where a county council rather intruded itself, was rather anxious to take over from the rural district council their powers, in those circumstances the Local Government Board thought that the county council should be expected to pay for the expenses which they incurred. There was a distinction between the cases of where the rural district council was in fault and of where the county council was merely taking over authority from the rural district council. A letter had reached the Local Government Board only that day from the Rural District Councils Association in which they said that they attached a great deal of importance to the proviso and were most anxious that the Amendment should not be carried as they felt that county councils would not be in a hurry to apply to the Local Government Board for wholesale transfer from the rural district councils where the rural district councils were not in default if they knew that the expense would have to be defrayed as part of the
<col>92</col>
general county expenses. They were anxious that the Amendment should not be accepted, and with that view the Local Government Board entirely concurred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00342"><member>LORD BELPER</member> thought it extremely likely that if the county council were compelled to raise a general rate in the county for the purpose of making an improvement in a rural district council's area, the proposal would not be carried on the county council because the representatives of the ratepayers on the council would not like to saddle their own districts with expenses which ought to be met by the area of the rural district for whose benefit those expenses were incurred. This Amendment was similar to one which they did their best to get inserted in the other House of Parliament, but which met with very scant support. He was bound to say he had heard no argument from the noble Earl in charge of the Bill why this proposal was unfair; why the expense which was to be incurred in a case where the Local Government Board approved of the county council taking over the duty of a rural district council should not fall upon the rural district council as it would do in the case where the rural district council spent the money itself. He believed the clause would be perfectly inoperative if left in its present state. He could not conceive that any county council would be able to pass a resolution to take over any powers, although they thought it was desirable and although the Local Government Board also thought it desirable, under the clause as it now stood. He could not conceive any case in which the representatives of the ratepayers of the rest of the county would submit to have thrown upon them an expense which ought to be borne by a locality.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00343"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said it was assumed that a county council were going to take upon themselves to discharge an office that they considered some district had neglected to discharge. What the Amendment suggested was that it should be charged upon the county rate unless after local inquiry the county council were satisfied that it was just to allocate the charge to the whole or part of the district where the expense had to be incurred. The point was whether or not the county council who had taken upon themselves to move in the matter and to discharge a duty which Ought to be discharged by the district,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0053"/>
<col>93</col>
should also have the right of saying that the defaulting district should pay. He had not heard a single argument why that was not a just provision. The powers were only optional on the county council. It was really in the interests of the working of the Bill, so that the proper work should be done and the proper charge put upon the district that ought to have done the work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00344"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord does not draw a clear distinction between Clause 12 and Clause 13. It is undoubtedly true that if there is a default on the part of the district authority and if their powers under those circumstances are taken over by the county council, the charge ought to be, and will be, borne by the district. But here you have an entirely different case. The county council say they would like to take over the powers of a certain rural district in order to engage it in a building scheme. The Local Government Board may think the power will be well exercised, but the building scheme may be of an extent, once the powers are taken over, which includes more than the rural district requires for its own purposes, and under such circumstances it does seem to me that if the county council choose to embark on a large and in itself a most useful scheme which may serve a great deal more, in the case of some populous community than the rural district involved, the charge should be equally spread over the county. Otherwise, I can conceive of cases in which a county council would be able to execute a really considerable scheme in one corner of its area and to charge the whole upon an unfortunate district which might not want the scheme at all. It is necessary to draw a distinction between Clause 12 and Clause 13.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00345"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> did not understand the argument of the noble Earl. He seemed to suggest that the county council would in this case be doing something which would be very hard on the ratepayers of the local district, but he surely must have forgotten that something very much harder might be done by the President of the Local Government Board to the ratepayers of the district entirely against their will. Did His Majesty's Government really suppose that a county council would ever take over the duties unless it could charge the expenses incurred
<col>94</col>
upon the district if it were thought right to do so? If the noble Earl desired he would be quite willing to add to the Amendment "with the consent of the Local Government Board," so as to obviate any possible case of unfairness on the part of the county council to the district. But if the Government could not agree to the Amendment he could only say that he entirely concurred with the view that the clause would not work at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00346"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member> was of opinion that the clause should disappear altogether. He could not imagine a county council placing itself in such a position as was portrayed in the clause, and so far as he could see it would be very much better if the Government would be good enough to jettison the whole of the clause. As the clause stood at present it was merely blocking up this part of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00347">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00348">Clause 13, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00349"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member> moved, after Clause 13, to insert a new clause that on the outside of every dwelling house subject to the operation of the Act there should be affixed by the owner, or, in the case of leasehold property, by the leaseholder, in a conspicuous position, the name and address of the owner or leaseholder, and also, if the house were let, the name and address of the landlord, and that any neglect of this requirement should render the owner or landlord liable to such fine as might be ordered by the Local Government Board. He said he had been moved to submit the clause by his own local and personal experience. He had on many occasions been led to the conviction by that experience that if such a clause as this were adopted it would effect almost automatically a very great improvement in a vast number of working-class cottages. In principle he could see no sort of objection to having houses so labled. Every farmer, and every one of their Lordships who might be a farmer, was expected to have his name on the farmer's cart, and he could see no reason in the nature of things why for the benefit of the public the name of the owner or leaseholder or landlord of a cottage should not be similarly made public. It would hardly
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0054"/>
<col>95</col>
fail as a matter of general practice to stimulate the attention and the care given to those cottages by the various owners or leaseholders. The good landlord or good owner had nothing to fear from the action of such a clause. The law had no terrors to the righteous man. He did not suppose there was a single member of their Lordships' House who had any cottages in such a condition that he had any reason whatever for not having his name on the outside. The clause was really directed against an entirely different class&#x2014;the negligent owner or the penurious owner, or, worst of all, the speculating owner. His conviction was that the clause simply by bringing these various classes into what might be called a beneficial and healthy publicity would automatically have a great effect in improving the condition of the whole class of cottages. He could not but feel that the healthy public opinion of the neighbourhood would by this simple requirement be brought directly to bear upon all that class of property, and it was for those reasons that he ventured to move the clause.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00351"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said their Lordships would not be surprised that His Majesty's Government were unable to see their way to accept the clause. At the same time, all people who were interested in the question of housing reform were agreed that one of the most difficult things was to find out who really was the owner and who was responsible for a house in an insanitary condition, and there was no doubt at all but that the idea at the root of the Amendment was one which would be very warmly welcomed by a large number of people whose work lay especially in the more crowded districts of our great towns. But the right rev. Prelate had moved the Amendment in a form which left a good deal to the imagination. It was not quite clear who were to be deemed the "owner" and the "land-
<col>96</col>
lord." The terms were not especially defined. There was a further proposal that the Local Government Board should impose fines upon certain individuals. That was a new proposal in our legislation, and there was also the difficulty that if the Local Government Board were to determine what fine ought to be imposed they would be obliged to go into the circumstances of each case, and it would be quite impossible for the Local Government Board to do that. In those circumstances he hoped that the right rev. Prelate would not press the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00352"><member>LORD NEWTON</member> was rather surprised that the Amendment had been received with so little sympathy. It seemed to him one which was deserving of some support as illustrative of what he might call the incongruities of ownership. The Gun Club, which he believed was the headquarters of pigeon shooting, was the property of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and he had no doubt that the right rev. Prelate would regard that particular dwelling place as almost unfit for human habitation. But, oddly enough, the right rev. Prelate, being an Ecclesiastical Commissioner himself, was therefore in the position of landlord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00353"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member> said it was for that reason, being an Ecclesiastical Commissioner, he inserted the word "leaseholder." The Ecclesiastical Commissioners were themselves landlords, and he believed the best of landlords, but much of their property was let on lease and they had no immediate power in such a case as that mentioned. His desire was, in the form in which he moved the clause, to restrict its operation to those who were personally and directly responsible. One part of the argument of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill was not quite clear to him. The noble Earl said that an objection to the clause was that they could not always find out who the owner or the leaseholder was, or that they could not do so without very great difficulty. If that were so, how was the law to be brought into operation at all? It must be possible to find the owner or no action could be taken in regard to houses. As he did not find that he had any very obvious support on either side of the House he would withdraw his proposal.</p>

The noble Earl in charge of the Bill was, of course, aware that all over the country cottage property came into hand at one time and another on the expiry of the life under old life-hold tenures, or on the expiry of a lease in the case of long leasehold tenures. Whenever such property came into hand the owners invariably found it in a very dilapidated condition, and only two alternatives might appear to be possible. One was that the owner should pull down the old dilapidated premises, and the other was that he should completely rebuild the premises. Such an alternative in these days would make it a little difficult for their Lordships to know where to turn, and the alternative of rebuilding dilapidated premises was not always easy to carry out. But, as a matter of fact, there was a third alternative, and it was that alternative which he was suggesting. What often happened was that where a person had been living for a number of years in an old dilapidated cottage that had come into hand, he went to the owner and said, "If you will give me a sufficiently long lease and allow me to continue to occupy the promises at a very
<col>98</col>
low rent, I will do repairs and make the house habitable, and I shall be glad to go on living there with my family." He could assure their Lordships that in a great many parts of the country that was not an imaginary case. If the clause stood as at present it would not be possible for owners to meet the wishes of their tenants in that way, because the clause said that no contracts should be made without the owner first putting the tenancy in proper repair. If the Amendment were carried the case would be met, because the words would be that the premises should not be occupied until they were put into a fit and proper condition.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00361"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought there would probably be a good deal of sympathy with the case put by the noble Lord, but he did not think the noble Lord had remembered that one effect of the Amendment would be that a landlord who had made a contract with a person of the worknig-class to let him a house within the meaning of the clause would be under no obligation to make the house reasonably fit for human habitation in itself, and the tenant could not occupy it until it had been made fit. The position in such circumstances would really be rather unfair to the tenant, and there seemed to be no reason why an obligation which had existed since the passing of the Housing Act of 1885 should now be altered. He thought that perhaps the noble Lord, after hearing that consideration, which, possibly, was new to him, would withdraw his Amendment and consider whether some other form of words might not be introduced.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00362"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked whether it was very likely that a workman would take a house in such a state that he could not occupy it without any contract that he should put it in order or that the landlord should do so.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00363"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said the case the noble Lord had put had constantly come before him. Working people did, unfortunately, take such houses, and if an accident happened the landlord relied upon that house having been taken without any

covenant or condition that it should be in a proper condition. The Amendment would only prevent a man taking a house going into occupation until it was fit. What was desired was to stereotype the fact that where houses were let to the working-classes there should be an implied condition that they were in a reasonable state. It was very desirable that it should be clear, because there were constantly cases where men took premises for better or worse, although utterly unfit for habitation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00364"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> thought some consideration should be paid to the fact that these leases were very common in some parts of the country.

He did not want to argue whether the system was a good or a bad one&#x2014;he dared say it was a very bad one&#x2014;but there were tens of thousands of cases in this country. It was a perfectly well recognised system in the south-west of England. He did not wish for one moment to take away the liability of any landlord to put his houses in repair before he let the m, but they should not attempt to do away with the system by this clause which really was brought in for quite a different object.</p>

He could assure the noble Earl that he was no enemy to this Bill. He only
<col>100</col>
wished to see it passed in a form which would do a maximum of good with as little injustice to everybody concerned as possible, and he hoped the noble Earl would accept his assurance that it was in the interests of a very large class of tenants of cottage property that he had brought forward this Amendment. It would enable men who had put by a little money and were anxious to take these repairing leases at a very low rent to do so. The landlord said, "I am not inclined to spend any money, but if you like to take this lease for a number of years at a very low rent you shall be allowed to do it."

It seemed to him very strange that they should define men of the working-classes, not by any-

thing in their occupation, but by the valuation of the house in which they lived. At the same time, there was nothing in the Bill which indicated who were the people for whom these houses were to be built. The Government appeared to have gone to work the wrong way. He thought what they ought to have done was to put in a definition of the working classes and leave the houses to look after themselves. But he did not wish to attribute to the Government any original sin which did not properly appertain to them, because he was bound to say that they were not the original sinners in this matter. The original sinners were the Government who passed the Act of 1890. He was rather curious to see how the sums &#x00A3;40, &#x00A3;26, and &#x00A3;16 were arrived at, and he thought he had discovered it. The limit of compound in London was &#x00A3;20, in other big towns in England &#x00A3;13, and in the country &#x00A3;8. His Majesty's Government had multiplied those figures by two&#x2014;twice twenty was forty; twice thirteen, twenty-six; and twice eight, sixteen. Why the Government did not multiply by four or divide by two he did not know, but perhaps they would tell their Lordships. At the same time, it would be seen that if they defined a man of the working-class by the house in which he lived, they really did not define a man but only a house. There was nothing, for instance, to prevent the noble Earl in charge of the Bill or himself from living in the country in a house rented at &#x00A3;16, and he knew many good houses in the country at that figure. If the noble Earl or he rented such a house there, with the assistance of three other householders they would be able to call upon their neighbours to support a scheme to build houses. What their Lordships really ought to do was to leave out this subsection altogether, and then to add a definition of working-classes as he proposed to do on a later clause.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00376"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he, had placed an Amendment on the Paper with regard to this clause, but he frankly admitted that he preferred his noble friend's Amendment to his own. The origin of this clause, for which he was afraid he was partly responsible, he being one of the original sinners of 1890, was simply this; that the limit of value in the compounding system was adopted in England as distinguishing the houses inhabited by the working-classes. Now, for some reason which he did not understand, except, no doubt, that rents had risen in the towns, the President of the Local Government Board had chosen to double that limit and define the houses occupied by the working-classes as houses in London of &#x00A3;40 rental, houses in other urban districts of &#x00A3;26 rental, and houses in the country of &#x00A3;16 rental. Their Lordships were probably acquainted with the rural districts of England, and to say that any person could properly be defined as a member of the working-classes who lived in a house in a country village at a rental of &#x00A3;16 was simply absurd. He thought a similar criticism, although not to so great an extent, might be applied to the rental proposed to be adopted with regard to urban districts. It would be far simpler to do what his noble friend proposed, <i>i.e.</i>, to adopt a definition of the working-classes which already existed in the law, and which his noble friend simply proposed to incorporate in this Bill. What was the history of the clause as it stood in this Bill? This clause had never been considered in another place. It was not considered by the Standing Committee before whom the Bill went last year. It was inserted in the Bill when introduced by the President of the Local Government Board in the present session, and it was never considered at all in Committee. Yet this was the clause which was produced to their Lordships as a definite proposition from the House of Commons. He hoped their

There was no doubt, as had already been suggested, that the clause would have the effect of doubling the number of compounders. He did not wish to argue by a side wind as to whether compounding was a good or a bad thing. As all their Lordships were aware, it was a thing about which there was a great deal to be said, and he, for his own part, thought an enormous amount could be said against it. But, without doubt, one effect of the clause would be to increase the system of compounding which so many thought to be deleterious. Perhaps he might be allowed to draw attention to an Amendment of his relating to line 36, with regard to the definition of rent. He did not know whether he was in order in speaking to an Amendment not exactly before their Lordships, but it was all part of the same question, and it might save time if he spoke to it now. His Amendment was in the nature of a drafting Amendment, and it referred to the rent of houses because, unless rent was specified as a rack rent, it would lead to a good deal of confusion, inasmuch as there were a number of large houses in London and elsewhere which were let at very low rents, sometimes as low as &#x00A3;10 or &#x00A3;20 a year, the balance being taken in premiums. Therefore, it would be better, he suggested, that the word "rack" should be inserted before "rent," which signified the rent of the full value of the house, otherwise there would be great danger of bringing houses under the purview of this clause which were not working class habitations at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00378"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> was afraid he had once more to say that it was impossible for His Majesty's Government to accept any of these Amendments, and that they would feel themselves obliged to ask their Lordships, if necessary, to divide upon this question. He thought it was obvious to any of their Lordships who had followed the discussion on this Bill that this particular provision was, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, one of the most important, and therefore they would be quite unable to agree to the Amendments. The noble Viscount had stated,
<col>104</col>
quite truly, what really was the determining factor with regard to the increase of the amounts. It was the fact that there had been a very marked increase in the rents of working-class dwellings, not only in London, but also in the provinces. He would give their Lordships some figures with regard to London. The average annual rental value of houses under &#x00A3;50 gross rental increased by about one-seventh between 1880 and 1900, and in some districts the increase was still greater. In St. Pancras and several other districts the increase was one-sixth, while in East London the rise was over one-fourth in Bethnal Green and as high as one-third in Stepney. In the provinces the increase was still greater. Thus, the average annual rental value of houses in Great Britain (excluding London) rented at &#x00A3;20 or less increased during the same period by more than twenty-five per cent., and the rise was continuous throughout this period. Taking all houses into consideration the actual increase in rent amounted to twenty-three per cent. during this period. That this increase was mainly due to the rise in the rents of working-class dwellings was shown by the fact that houses rented at &#x00A3;20 or under, though more in number than in 1880, were proportionately fewer in 1900. There were some figures extracted from the London County Council statistics which showed the average weekly rents of new working-class tenements in London and its neighbourhood. In Marylebone rent was 12<i>s.</i> 9&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> for four rooms to 19<i>s.</i> for six rooms; in Stepney from 11<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> for four rooms to 18<i>s.</i> for six rooms; in Southwark, 10<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for four rooms to 18<i>s.</i> for six rooms; in Fulham 13<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for four rooms to 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (&#x00A3;40 a year) for six rooms; and in Acton 11<i>s.</i> 8&#x00BE;<i>d.</i> for four rooms to 17<i>s.</i> for six rooms. The average for Central London was 10<i>s.</i> for four rooms to 17<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> (&#x00A3;45a year) for six rooms. Therefore their Lordships would see that the figures proposed in the Bill were not extravagant. It was probably an open secret that His Majesty's Government had been much pressed to make the figures even higher than at present. In the opinion of the Government the figures proposed by the Bill were a reasonable compromise which they hoped their Lordships would be very unwilling to disturb.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00379"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> was afraid the noble Earl and he were rather
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0059"/>
<col>105</col>
at cross purposes. This was a Bill for dwellings for the working-classes. The question, therefore, naturally was, Who were the working-classes? How did they ascertain who was a working man, except by defining him? He did not object at all to the figures which the noble Earl quoted. If the Amendment he proposed to move later were accepted the effect would be that while a working-class man would be defined, the value of the house would be left at any figure which was found desirable. The houses would be houses suitable for the working-classes. Perhaps he might say, for the information of their Lordships, that his definition of the working classes was the one in the Standing Orders of the House, and was the generally recognised definition of working-classes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00380"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said that in any observations he might offer his sole object was to make the Bill a good one. He was greatly in sympathy with the object of the Bill, but he had not heard one word to suggest that the standard set up in this clause was the right one, and, having an intimate acquaintance with the suburbs of London, he did say that to take &#x00A3;40 as the standard of a house for the working-classes was an absurdity. There were thousands of clerks who could not be called working class men who lived in houses rented at &#x00A3;25 or &#x00A3;30 a year, and therefore he wanted to know why this standard in the clause should be adopted in preference to the definition of the noble Earl.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00381"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Here again we have two entirely separate questions to consider. The first is the noble Earl's proposal that a definition of working-classes as people who pursue certain occupations, and whose income does not rise above a certain amount, should be adopted in place of a rental basis. It is quite true that that definition is a well-known one; it is used in the Housing Act of 1902, with particular reference to the housing of persons displaced by public improvements. That is the only case I can recall at the moment in which it is used. Well, in that case, it is very easy to find out whether people fulfil those particular conditions. I think the noble Lord proposed to limit the provision of these houses to persons of 30<i>s.</i> a week. Supposing a man after becoming an

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00383"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was under the impression that the noble Earl had nothing more to say, but I certainly will postpone it. I was speaking of the difficulty of dealing with this continuous operation of the particular kind of definition proposed by the noble Earl in order that the subsection might not be struck out, because, if it is struck out, we shall have no useful opportunity of discussing the particular terms of the noble Earl's further Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00388"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No. Perhaps he might remind the noble Earl what it was. He (Lord Camperdown) said that he was going to propose to insert the words "as defined by this Act," but he pointed out that the clause dealing with the definition would not be reached for some time, and that, therefore, as it was wiser not to count his chickens before they were hatched, he had better postpone these words until the Report stage. What the Committee were now on was his Amendment to strike out subsection (2) of Clause 14.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00389"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is perfectly correct; but instead of counting his chickens before they are hatched he is proceeding to break the eggs.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0003P0I0060"/>
<col>107</col>
for it, because it must be a consideration when you are dealing with such a proposal to inquire whether there is anything else that can be reasonably put in its place, so that I do not think I have travelled outside the rules of order in your Lordships' House. What I have said so far is with regard to a substitute. Now as regards the question of rent, I was extremely surprised to hear the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice say that there are no workmen's dwelling in London, so far as he knows, or very few which are rented at &#x00A3;40.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00392"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: I really did not say so. What I said was that &#x00A3;40 a year is no test, because I know numbers of single houses, occupied by clerks, which are rented at &#x00A3;25 or &#x00A3;30 a year&#x2014;not &#x00A3;40.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00393"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble and learned Lord's pardon. I have no doubt he is perfectly correct, but that does not alter the fact that there are a great many cases in London where persons have to pay 12<i>s</i>. or 15<i>s</i>. a week, the latter amount working out to about &#x00A3;40 a year. The idea that in rural districts there are no houses rented at &#x00A3;16 occupied by the working-classes is treated as preposterous. It is quite true, no doubt, that cottages owned by your Lordships may be rented at 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per week, and sometimes less, but if I were told that there were no workmen who pay 6<i>s</i>. or a little more for their houses, I confess I should be very greatly surprised. I venture to think, therefore, that so far as the figures of rent are concerned, the case of the noble Viscount is not supported by evidence. My noble friend Lord Beauchamp gave a series of figures as to the rents in London, some of which I think must have almost surprised noble Lords opposite. But if the Committee are determined that the principle of selection of classes of persons, instead of by the value of houses, shall be adopted, you will no doubt do so, but I very much doubt whether it is a wise system to adopt. I do not believe it would find favour as a rule with the people who own these houses. It is an infinitely more convenient classification for the landlord to know that houses of a particular rental are treated as working-class houses rather than to select houses with a particular class of inhabitant. I go further and say it does not seem reasonable that a house of this kind should not be occupied
<col>108</col>
by persons who do not come under the definition of the noble Earl, and I mention that merely in order to enforce the point that it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at any definition of the working classes in a matter of this kind which will not prove to be unfair to individuals. There are people of various other occupations, such as typists, and very small clerks in some cases, who might very properly be housed under these circumstances, and I know no argument against it. Therefore, under the circumstances, I do not think your Lordships would be acting wisely if you were to attempt to pin down these houses to a particular class of persons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00394">On Question, Amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00395"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> moved an Amendment to subsection (2) so as to define the expression "letting for habitation by persons of the working-classes" as meaning letting at a "rack" rent not exceeding the amounts set forth in the subsection. He said this did not amount to very much more than a drafting Amendment. There were sometimes questions, for instance in London, where houses were not working-class houses at all but were let at very low rents with a premium, and unless "rack" rent was specified in the clause it might lead to confusion. His Amendment was really meant more for the avoidance of confusion than with any particular principle.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00397"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the Government were unable to accept this Amendment. In his previous speech he had referred to the question of compounding, and he was informed that that really did not arise under the present clause. Therefore, it was unnecessary for their Lordships to consider it in this connection. There was, he thought, sound reason for using the word "rent." It was the word used in Section 75 of the Housing Act of 1890, and this clause was only an extension of that. It was also used in Section 12 of the Housing Act of 1885. He thought there would be very real difficulty in particular cases in deciding what was, as a matter of fact, "rack" rent; and the substitution of a rather indefinite term, which would give rise to a good deal of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0061"/>

uncertainty, was, he thought, most undesirable in a clause dealing with contracts. He hoped the noble Lord would withdraw the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00398"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said the only object of his Amendment was to avoid uncertainty, but it was not of such importance that he desired to press it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00400"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST.

This matter had been discussed at such length that he did not want to detain their Lordships on it, but as the Government could not accept the principle for which the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, contended, he hoped they might be able to accept some kind of reduction of the figures in the Bill. As he had reminded their Lordships, these figures had never been considered at all in another place, but were purely the suggestion of the President of the Local Government Board, and therefore it was perfectly competent for their Lordships to deal with them as they thought right without any reference to anything that had been decided elsewhere. He confessed he was not so cognisant with the rents in London and large towns as he was with those in the country, and his feeling was that the figure of &#x00A3;16 was quite excessive for the country districts. He would, however, move his first Amendment to substitute &#x00A3;30 for &#x00A3;40 in order to obtain some reply from His Majesty's Government as to their particular reason for taking this figure.</p>

country, and therefore deserved, <i>prima facie,</i> some attention from their Lordships. He was very sorry he could not give the noble Viscount more information than he had already given with regard to the rents of working-class tenements in London.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00403"><member>EARL CADOGAN</member> asked whether the figures which the noble Earl had given referred to the rents of tenements, of houses, or of dwellings, because his noble friend and the Leader of the House had used these terms as if they were synonymous. Just now the noble Earl in charge of the Bill said these statistics were statistics of tenements, but when he first read them out he had alluded to them as rents of houses. He thought it well to clear this point up.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00404"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said these figures referred to the weekly rents of working-class houses in London, taken from the London County Council's statistics, and published, he believed, during the present year, although they referred to 1907.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00406"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he did not think they were, but he was sorry that he had not furnished himself with more figures for the satisfaction of the noble Viscount. If the noble Viscount would bring the matter up at a later stage, he would see he was well furnished with figures, dealing not only with weekly rents for London, but also for the provinces, and he would do his best to give the noble Viscount the information for which he sought.</p>

He said that his object in putting down the Amendment was to guard against repairing leases being affected by the operation of the clause, but as he understood that they would probably be dealt with on Report he would not refer to them at this stage. He would, however, mention the case of ordinary farm tenancies where, as a matter of course, the tenant was now under an obligation to do certain repairs. He did not suppose for a moment that the clause was intended to apply to such tenancies, but from the wording of it he had no doubt that it would apply, particularly where the house was within the limit of value specified in a previous section. The cases he had in mind were those of tenancies in respect of which there was the ordinary clause in the lease that the tenant should keep his roof watertight and perform other repairs of a minor character, neglect of

which would in time make the house unfit for human habitation. If the noble Earl did not like the words of the Amendment perhaps he would agree to consider the matter and deal with it later.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00426"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> understood the noble Lord to raise specifically the question of farm tenancies. He did not think it was the intention of the Local Government Board that farm tenancies should be considered under this section, and if the noble Lord would put down before Report an Amendment dealing specifically with tenancies of that description he thought it would be possible to deal with the matter more satisfactorily than they could possibly do. In connection with an Amendment which obviously included a good deal more than the noble Lord intended.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00427"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> wished to know how the clause would affect the letting of royalties. When a royalty owner let to a company of coalowners the right to work his minerals, the coalowners sometimes had handed over to them houses or cottages already built, and at other times they built houses themselves for their <i>employ&#x00E9;s,</i> which returned to the royalty owner at the termination of the lease or when the coal was exhausted. It appeared to him that under this clause the royalty owner might be forced to repair the houses of the colliery company. That would be a serious liability, and one that would never be contemplated when the colliery was let by the royalty owner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00428"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> remarked that he was not an expert in these matters, but he thought that if the intention had been such as the noble Duke suggested the clause would have read "owner or landlord."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00429"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> was afraid he could not accept as a satisfactory explanation what the noble Earl had said about "owner or landlord," because subsection (5) of the clause under discussion stated that "the expression 'landlord' means any person who lets
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0064"/>
<col>115</col>
the house under any contract referred to in this section and includes his successors in title, and the expression 'house' includes part of a house." That was the definition of the person who let the house.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00430"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> still thought that the words of the clause met the case the noble Duke had mentioned, and that the owner would not be liable under the circumstances mentioned for the repairs. If, however, there was any serious fear that difficulties would arise in regard to such a matter he hoped the noble Duke would himself put down an Amendment that would in his opinion meet the case, and it would receive careful consideration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00431"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> asked if Earl Beauchamp would accept an Amendment dealing with the question of repairs if it covered only the case of farm tenancies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00432"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> replied that he did not feel in a position to promise anything on the subject. What he had said was that in his opinion the question of farm tenancies was not one which was intended by the Local Government Board to be included in the clause. He opposed the Amendment as moved by Lord Clinton because it included a good deal more than farm tenancies. If the noble Lord would put an Amendment down relating only to farm tenancies it should receive the careful attention of the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00433"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> said that if their Lordships passed this clause without an Amendment such as that put down by his noble friend it would mean that they would revolutionise the system under which small cottage property was tenanted all over the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00434"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> did not think that Earl Beauchamp had brought forward any strong argument against the Amendment. Suppose a tenant had undertaken to do repairs, why should he not be liable to perform them? Why should they make the landlord liable for these repairs by Act of Parliament? They ought to have a better reason from the noble Earl why the Amendment should not be inserted before deciding not to press it.</p>
<col>116</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00435"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> explained that he did not deal with the matter fully because he did not think the point was seriously pressed by Lord Clinton. He understood the question was likely to be more seriously raised on a subsequent part of the Bill. Viscount St. Aldwyn would see that Lord Clinton's Amendment enabled a landlord and tenant to contract themselves entirely out of the undertaking. That, of course, was an Amendment to which His Majesty's Government could not agree. The clause was really intended for the protection of a class of tenants very different from those referred to by the Duke of Northumberland and Lord Clinton. It was meant to cover the case of the class which was generally too poor and ignorant to be able to protect itself. If the Amendment were accepted it would practically make the clause of no effect in any place where houses were scarce and there was a great deal of competition for them. He was afraid it was only too true that there were persons who had no objection to living in houses which were in reality unfit for human habitation. They were only too ready, if they could get possession of a house, to undertake to perform the necessary repairs, and they did so without fully appreciating what that undertaking meant. The real objection the Government had to the Amendment, and it was one which he was afraid they could not get over, was that it would result in giving a very general power to landlords and tenants to contract themselves out of this particular clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00436"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> was rather at a loss to understand why the noble Earl objected to the Amendment. He had said that the Government were unwilling to allow landlord and tenant to contract themselves out of the Bill. As they knew, however, a working man might live in a house up to &#x00A3;40 a year. Was he a person unable to protect himself in any sort of way? Was he not able to undertake an obligation to perform necessary repairs? The truth was the Government were determined to do away with contract altogether and to manage the business by Act of Parliament. He thought, however, that they would find it very difficult, and that the business would be badly done. He did not understand at present why a man who was paying &#x00A3;40 for a house was not to be allowed to make a contract of any kind.</p>

<col>117</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00437"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> observed that the clause would operate against a certain class of small landlords who let hovels of any description for a very small sum and compelled the tenants to put them in repair. He knew of a few cases of that kind. The cottages were in the worst possible condition. They were occupied by indigent and dirty people, who did not keep them in repair. They paid one or two sovereigns a year to live in these hovels, and were satisfied to let the places get into any state of neglect. The clause would prevent those cottages being contracted out of the provisions of the Bill, and if only for that reason he thought it would be a good thing if the clause were allowed to remain as printed in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00438"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> thought the best course, perhaps, would be for Lord Clinton not to press the Amendment now, but, as the Government had admitted that there were cases in respect of which exceptions might very properly be made, or, at any rate, that they would favourably consider proposals of the kind, that the matter should be brought up again on Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00439"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am quite willing to fall in with the course suggested by the noble Viscount opposite. What the Government want is to prevent any agreement between a landlord and tenant to create and maintain a slum. In my opinion, if the noble Lord's Amendment were accepted it would undoubtedly be possible to do that. It is true there may be cases, such as those mentioned by the noble Lord and also by the noble Duke, which need further consideration. I have no doubt that the Local Government Board will carefully consider what has been said before the Report stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00440">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00441"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> moved an Amendment at the end of the first subsection providing that "nothing herein contained shall make it obligatory on the landlord to remedy any defect caused by the act or default of the tenant or occupier, or any person for whom the tenant is as between himself and the landlord responsible." He said that Clause 15 made a very considerable alteration in the law, because it provided that in respect of houses within a rental value specified in Clause 14
<col>118</col>
the landlord should not only be responsible for the house being at the commencement of the tenancy in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation, but that his responsibility should continue throughout the whole of the tenancy. Under those circumstances it was only fair to guard against a contingency which was not at all unknown&#x2014;namely, that of having a tenant who, either wilfully or by gross carelessness, did great damage to a house. It was not at all an uncommon thing for a tenant to let a house go out of such repair as he was supposed to keep it in, to fail to keep it clean, to remove floors or windows, and to play havoc generally with the place either by a wilful act or by failure to look properly after the premises. In that way the house was rendered unfit for human habitation, and it was done in such a way that the landlord could not possibly be held responsible for it. It was impossible for the landlord always to prevent damage being done in such a manner, and the object of the Amendment was to relieve him of responsibility in a contingency of that kind. He ventured to say that such a provision was necessary because unless there were some safeguard the clause would put into the hands of malicious people another weapon against the landlord. Malicious people might do great damage and might bring on the landlord, not only the cost of the repairs, but also of the initiation of proceedings by the local authority under the clause. He did not wish to take away from the landlord the obligation of keeping his house fit for human habitation as a general rule, but it must be evident that he should be guarded from the very serious danger he would run owing to the unfair position he would be placed in by a tenant who by gross carelessness or by wilful malice made his tenement unfit for human habitation. Such a very simple Amendment he thought ought to recommend itself to the notice of their Lordships.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00443"><member>THE EARL OF HARROWBY</member> regarded the Amendment as very important, more especially as it affected agricultural cottages. Landlords in the country only re-

ceived from &#x00A3;3 to &#x00A3;5 a year for cottages, and if this clause were passed he could not help thinking that rents would have to be put up all round. Landlords would have to spend a great deal of money on property of this class or else a good many cottages which were not in a thorough state of repair would have to be pulled down.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00444"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> very much regretted that the Government could not accept the Amendment as it stood. There was, however, an Amendment down, he believed, to Clause 17, in his name, which would to some extent penalise a tenant who treated his landlord's house with disrespect. He would remind the noble Lord who had moved the Amendment that there was one remedy which was always in the hands of the landlord. He could always give notice to a tenant, and as most of the cottages were held on weekly tenancies this would involve a speedy clearance of the objectionable occupier. Therefore if tenants were found to be neglecting a house in such a way that it was likley to become unfit for human habitation the landlord had the remedy in his own hands. He could turn out the man almost at once, and with a vigilant estate agent he did not think it was likely that a landlord would suffer any great damage from injury which might be accomplished by a tenant. He readily admitted that the Amendment which he intended to move at a later stage did not entirely cover the point. Their Lordships would know that there was a clause dealing with compensation to be paid to people who were turned out of their houses. The Amendment he proposed to move prevented those people who had treated their houses badly from receiving any compensation if they were removed, and he hoped that would be sufficient to meet the wishes of the noble Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00445"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said that he and his noble freinds had not been able to find the Amendment referred to by the noble Earl.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00446"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I regret to say it is not on the Paper. My noble friend was mistaken in thinking that it had been put down.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00447"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said that, of course, noble Lords on that side accepted the noble Earl's statement regarding his intention to have the Amendment put on the Paper. But even if this ghostly
<col>120</col>
Amendment had appeared on the Paper he was not sure that it would have met the argument of his noble friend, because, as he understood it, all the Amendment would ensure was that when a tenant had been turned out and there was a claim for compensation it would be set off against any wilful damage he had committed. That was a very different point from the one they were now discussing. If a tenant rendered his house unfit for human habitation by his own default, it seemed very hard that the landlord should be held responsible. The remedy, said the noble Earl, was to turn the man out of his cottage. Did not the noble Earl see that there might be a very great deal of damage done before the man could be got rid of. Suppose the cottage was occupied by a drunken fellow who smashed all the windows and left the rooms undoubtedly unfit for human habitation. Was a landlord to be held responsible and to be called on to turn the tenant out of his holding? Perhaps by so doing he would cause great misery and distress to the wife and family. He could see possibilities of great hardships being caused in such cases, and he held that the landlord ought not to be made responsible for something which happened through no fault of his own. If the noble Earl could not accept the words of Lord Zouche perhaps he would give his noble friend a promise that the matter should be looked into at a later stage. That seemed to be only elementary justice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00448"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL of CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree that the case mentioned by the noble Marquess would be a hard one for the landlord, but the remedy of eviction which the noble Marquess thinks hard on the other side is not quite the only one that is available. What would happen supposing the landlord were not liable? Somebody would be liable, because the house bas to be put in repair. I suppose the tenant would be liable. As the Bill stands it is in the landlord's power to tell the tenant that if he does not put the place in repair at his own expense he will have to go. The effect in those circumstances would be the same as that which the noble Lord, I suppose, wishes to bring about&#x2014;namely, to transfer the liability from landlord to tenant.</membercontribution></p>

<col>121</col>
of quitting the tenement or doing the repairs. I think in the case put by the noble Marquess of a drunken man who breaks all the windows, it would be distinctly reasonable for the landlord to say, "I do not want to turn you out, but you must repair all the windows or go." The rural case has been mainly argued, but I should like to point out that in the minds of those who have drawn the Bill it is the urban case which is considered most important, and it is thought especially desirable to put this pressure upon landlords to look closely after their property in urban areas. I have no doubt the existence of this liability will make landlords look more carefully after their town property than has been the case hitherto.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00451"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said that he was, of course, in their Lordships' hands. He felt rather a difficulty in dealing with the matter, because the noble Earl in charge of the Bill said that part of his case would be met by an Amendment he had put down to be moved later on, and it had turned out that the Amendment was not on the Paper. He thought this was a matter of extreme importance, because it was not only a question of making the tenant liable to do this or that, or, should there be any question of compensation, treating the amount of the damage as a set off against the compensation, but it was a question of freeing the landlord from a very unfair burden that might be laid on him. In regard to the point that the landlord might turn a man out of premises which had been misused, it did not follow that he could do so at once, because a house might be let on a longer term than a week. Of course, he did not know whether their Lordships gave him any support or not, but if they did he should be inclined, in the absence of any better way of dealing with the matter, to press the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00452"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> trusted that the noble Lord would press the Amendment. The doctrine laid down by noble Lords opposite was a very serious one. They said it was to be made the law of the land that a tenant should be protected from the landlord, and that the landlord should have the duty of doing all the repairs. The noble Earl who led the House said that in case of wilful damage the landlord was to say to the tenant, "You are either not to take the protection which the law gives you, or you are to be evicted. The law says you
<col>122</col>
need not repair." When the Bill was going through the other House the attention of His Majesty's Government was called to this, and they said they did not think the tenant should repair. The landlord, therefore, was to tell the tenant that, unless he did that which the Government now said they would not enforce, he would evict the tenant. That was placing the landlord in a very false position, and he trusted the noble Lord would force the matter to a decision.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00453"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> desired to know where the hardship lay. If they let a house to a tenant and he destroyed the windows, they had a remedy against him at law for damaging the property. If the tenant did the same thing again, he could again be punished. Therefore he did not see where the hardships came in on the part of the landlord. He himself let a good many houses on repairing leases and a good many which he had to repair himself. He was thoroughly convinced that if a man did not fulfil his obligations they had the right to proceed against him by ordinary law and to compel him to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00454"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> pointed out that noble Lords on the Government Bench had not answered the Duke of Northumberland's question as to colliery cottages&#x2014;that was to say, they had not stated whether the owner or the colliery people to whom he had leased the property were to be liable for keeping the cottages in repair. A very serious position would be created in the Midlands and the North of England where landowners had much colliery property if they were to be made liable for these repairs.</p>

Zouche of Haryngworth on the previous Amendment, because they accurately represented what he proposed. The noble Earl the Leader of the House had told them it was desirable that landlords should look more closely after their property, and it was partly with that object that these Amendments had been suggested. He would refer their Lordships to subsection (3) of the Amendment, which provided that the landlord or the local authority or any other authorised person might at reasonable times enter any house for the purpose of viewing its condition. It was only fair that there should be a right of entry in these cases, because under the existing law once a house was let the landlord had no right of entry, unless it was specially agreed to. Clause 15 of the present Bill made no provision for entry, although they were imposing on the landlord the duty of keeping the tenement in a proper state of repair.</p>

If he might take only one part of it, he would refer to the last subsection, which stated that on a tenant failing to comply with an undertaking he should forfeit his remedy against the landlord at common law.

It is a Motion which is usually made towards the close of the session, though I do not know whether I am correct in so describing the present moment. The principal alterations are to include motor roads and tram-roads, because that is a new form of road and there are no provisions for it at present. The other principal alterations require that Bills relating to different works should be deposited at certain Government offices other than those at which the Standing Orders at present provide that Bills should be deposited.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00503">Consideration of Clause 15 resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00504"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> moved that the time given by the local authority to the landlord for executing the repairs which they thought necessary should be not less than twenty-eight days instead of not less than fourteen days. Clearly if a reasonable time was to be given, there did not appear to be any very great reason why they should put in any time at all; but under subsection (4) the landlord might appeal to the Local Government Board against any notice requiring him to execute
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0072"/>
<col>131</col>
works under this section, and also against the cost of the work if it had been done by the local authority. In that case a period had been given to him in which to appeal, and possibly it had occurred to the person who drafted the clause that if the reasonable time in which the landlord had to execute these works was less than the time which was given him for appeal, he might be required to finish the work when he was still in a position to appeal to the Local Government Board as to whether he should do the work at all. Therefore, strictly speaking, whatever the time given, whether fourteen days as proposed in the clause or twenty-eight days as he proposed in his Amendment, it would obviously have to be a reasonable time <i>plus</i> the time given for appeal, because the person who had the right to appeal would be entitled to take that period during which he would consider whether he would appeal or not, and the time ought not to begin to run until the expiration of the time given for notice of appeal.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00506"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member> said that naturally the Local Government Board preferred the period of fourteen days which was put in the Bill after a great deal of consideration, but in this matter he would be glad to come to terms with the noble Lord, and, if he would agree, the Local Government Board would halve the difference, and accept twenty-one days instead of fourteen days.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00509"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> moved to substitute the word "shall" for "may."

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00512">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00513"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved a new subsection providing that if within twenty-eight days of the receipt of a notice calling on him to make certain repairs the landlord by written notice to the local authority declared his intention of closing the house a closing order should be deemed to have become operative. He said this section as it stood in the Bill provided that if the provisions of subsection (1) so far as keeping a house in repair during the tenancy was concerned was not complied with, the local authority might require the owner to execute such works as they might consider necessary to make the house in all respects fit for human habitation, and if the notice to the landlord was not complied with the local authority might execute the works themselves and charge the cost to the owner. In his opinion there should be given to the owner some power of alternative in the matter&#x2014;that was to say, he should be allowed to close his house in preference to carrying out the repairs which the local authority imposed upon him. There were many occasions when a landlord would quite rightly prefer to close a house rather than reconstruct or improve it. He did not think there was anything to lead them to believe that any owner would ask for a closing order against his house if he could in any respects make it fit for human habitation; but he submitted that the land-lord should have the right of an alternative. It often happened in rural districts that a house was so old-fashioned and out of date that it would be impossible to make it conform with the demands of the local authority and present building requirements without going to an excessive cost. Another thing that often happened in rural districts was that a house was no longer required for the convenience of the district, and in these cases a landlord should have the power to close it rather than carry out the repairs. Unfortunately owing to the constant migration from the country to the towns which was going on here as in every other country in the world, and owing to the fact of industries being closed
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0073"/>
<col>133</col>
down many existing houses were not required. Farms which had been arable farms were now being changed into pasture or grazing or dairy farms, and a number of cottages which were formerly occupied were not required. It would be a very considerable hardship that a local authority should be able to say in any of those cases that a landlord must put his house in repair and not be allowed to close it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00514">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 7, line 19, after the word 'habitation' to insert the following new subsection:</quote>
<quote>'(3) Within twenty-eight days after the receipt of such notice the landlord may by written notice to the local authority declare his intention of closing the house for human habitation and thereupon a closing order shall be deemed to have become operative in respect of such house.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clinton.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00515"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member>, in supporting the Amendment, quoted a case which came under his own observation with regard to a very poor owner. This man was required to do certain repairs to his house. He had practically no money with which to do these repairs, and the surveyor who was ordering the repairs came to him (Lord Clifford) to ask him to join in a subscription to help this man to do his own repairs. Therefore it was quite possible that in many of these cases a very poor owner might be forced to do very expensive repairs to a very old and tumble-down house. In those cases it would certainly be a very great injustice to compel repairs to a house which might possibly be not worth repairing at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00516"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he was sorry that His Majesty's Government did not see their way to accept this Amendment, and he thought for a sufficient reason. It would be observed that this order would only come after certain things had happened. The clause made it the landlord's duty to keep a house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation, and if a landlord failed to carry out that obligation, it scarcely seemed fair that he should be able to evade that obligation by closing the house after having neglected for some time to keep it in proper repair. There was this alternative always within the power of the landlord, that he could give notice to his tenant. In cases of property like this they were usually weekly tenants. Then the house would be automatically closed. If the local authority had reason to think that a landlord would take advantage of this on
<col>134</col>
any considerable scale in any district where houses were scarce, they would naturally hesitate to resort to the powers under this clause. A demolition order generally followed a closing order after three months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00517"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> said he did not understand that the demolition order followed after three months. The Bill provided that the landlord should put the house into proper repair, or the local authority could do it at his expense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00518"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I would regret to see any words in the Bill which would put it in the power of any landlord to evade the provisions of this clause altogether by falling back upon closing orders. On the other hand, I think my noble friend has mentioned a case in which a good deal of unnecessary hardship would be occasioned to the owner of cottage property. He cited the case of an old-fashioned worn-out tenement, which really was not worth repairing, or, indeed, was in such a state that no amount of repair would bring it up to the standard required by the Bill. It would be hard in a case of that kind if the owner were to be obliged to perpetuate the tenancies. But I gather that the suggestion of His Majesty's Government is that in all such cases the natural process which the owner would have to resort to would be that of giving notice to his tenant, and terminating his occupation in that manner. If that is the view of the Government, I do not know that my friend would gain very much by pressing his words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00519"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked how the matter stood. Earl Beauchamp said the landlord had the power of turning out his tenant, but as he (the Duke of Northumberland) understood it, the landlord received an order to repair the house. Was he first of all to repair the house and then turn out the tenant, or was he to turn out his tenant and then repair the house? He did not see how the landlord was to escape from the order to repair the house, and that was the first difficulty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00520"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: I think the case is not so difficult as the noble Duke seems to think. The point is this. A house has to be declared, and has to be, unfit for human habitation. That being so, the landlord has to make up his mind whether
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0074"/>
<col>135</col>
he will repair it or close it. If he wants to close it his proper course is to give notice to the tenant to quit, and in that case he can do what he likes with the house. But if he will not make up his mind and leaves the house in the condition that it is unfit for human habitation, he will be forced to repair it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00521"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Then I understand that in a case of that kind the owner of the house would not be compelled to execute the repairs?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00522"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: He would have to make up his mind first. I agree with what the noble Marquess said at first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00523"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: But if he does make up his mind that he does not think it worth his while to do the repairs, it will not be incumbent upon him to do them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00524"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am assuming that, of course. It is only fair to add that this would practically only apply in cases of very short tenancy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00525"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> pointed out that an order might be obtained from the magistrates declaring the house unfit for human habitation, and these people would have to be evicted. That was a very unpleasant position. That kind of thing had come under his notice as chairman of a rural district council. They gave notice to a landlord to do repairs, and he said:&#x2014; "I will do the work, but am I to turn these people out?" They gave him time generally to turn them out, which probably was as soon as the landlord found another place for them to go to; but if they chose to get an order from a magistrate to say that the house was unfit for human habitation they could turn the people out at once, and then the house had to be repaired.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00526"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> pointed out that what the Bill said was this, that the authority should, if a closing order was not made with respect to the house, by written notice require the landlord, within a reasonable time, not being less than fourteen days specified in the notice, to execute such works as the authority might specify. That was the order, and there was nothing in the Bill to say that that order should not be enforced if the landlord evicted his tenant. The landlord
<col>136</col>
would have to put the house in order. If Earl Beauchamp wished that that should not be so, he ought to put in words to make that plain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00527"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought their Lordships would see that there was really no substantial difference between the Marquess of Lansdowne and the Lord Privy Seal, but at the same time they would see that it was quite impossible for a Bill of this kind to provide for every possible contingency. This Bill did not alter the ordinary common law. There was no reason to state every instance in which the common law was not altered, and this did not seem to be a special instance in which the obligation lay upon the Local Government Board to say that there was no alteration in the ordinary law. If they were to do that, this Bill would assume very gigantic proportions. There was no real doubt about the position. If a landlord chose to give notice to his tenant he could do it, and the result would be that the house would naturally be closed automatically.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00528"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member> said that the position might be that a landlord had got an order to repair his cottage. He decided that sooner than repair it he would demolish it. He got an order and evicted his tenant; but the fact remained that although the tenant was evicted the order calling upon him to repair the cottage was still in existence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00529"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said the landlord was also affected by the next subsection, which said that if the notice was not complied with the authority might, at the expiration of the time specified in the notice, do the work required to be done and recover the expenses incurred by them in so doing from the landlord. There really was a case to be met there, and a very few words would meet it&#x2014;namely, to give the landlord the option of saying, "I would rather close my house than do the repairs or be liable to pay to the local authority the cost of the repairs." That was the question. The questions of occupation and tenancy and notice to quit did not arise. Ought not the landlord to have the option of saying, "The man does not want to be turned out, but if you are going to order me to do the repairs, or make me pay for them if you do them, I prefer to close the house."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00530"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> asked would not the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0075"/>
<col>137</col>
object Lord Alverstone had in his mind be met by the Government accepting Lord Clinton's Amendment. If their Lordships would look over subsection (2) of Clause 15 they would see that the Government themselves had put in the words, "If a closing order is not made with respect to the house." The Government had already admitted that such a thing could be done. Why should they not accept the Amendment?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00531"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said all that they required was an assurance from the Government, after they had heard the weighty opinion of Lord Alverstone and the intimation from the Leader of the House as to what was intended. They wanted an assurance that the Government would see that this was put right. It would shorten the discussion very much if they had that assurance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00532"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am anxious that there should be no hardship, and I think I said it would be incumbent on the landlord to make up his mind whether he would proceed with the tenancy or decide to pull down the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00533"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: That is all the Amendment gives him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00534"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: He ought to have that option at some time, and the Amendment allows him to continue that option for too long a time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00535"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: It is only a question of language. All the Amendment does is to give him an option of saying "I will close the house rather than do this."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00536"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I think I must press the Amendment unless we have this assurance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00537"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that in the circumstances the Government would not object to this being put in, although really the difference between them was very small. The point was whether a landlord should close the house before the expiration of the time which was given to him or afterwards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00538">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<col>138</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00539"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved an Amendment to provide that the appeal allowed to the landlord under the clause should be, not to the "Local Government Board" but to the "County Court of the district." He said there were several decisions which could be made by a local authority in this Bill against which His Majesty's Government recognised that there ought to be a right of appeal. There were closing orders and demolition orders, there were decisions whether a closing order should be removed, questions whether an extension of time should be granted, and there were others, all of which were to be decided in the first instance by the local authority, but in regard to which, in nearly all of them, the Government recognised there ought to be a right of appeal by the owner or landlord. The question raised in his Amendment was whether the appeal which the Government provided was the right kind of appeal. They should consider the precise question about which an appeal was granted under this clause. The procedure was that a local authority first made up their minds that a particular house was not reasonably fit for human habitation, and thereupon they might give notice to the owner to repair the house. If the owner did not obey their notice they might repair the house themselves and charge the expense to the owner. Evidently the question upon which an appeal must be tried was whether the house was unfit or was not reasonably fit for human habitation. His point was whether the Local Government Board was the right court of appeal to determine such a question as that. He submitted it was not. In the first place they did not know under the Bill what procedure the Board would adopt in order to try such an appeal. As far as he knew they had no judicial procedure whatever at their command, and they had no training to arrive at a judicial opinion. In the second place, it was evident that these matters ought to be put through with as much despatch and with as little difficulty as the interests of justice would allow. Was it right that such small matters as the closing of a particular house in a provincial town should be sent up to London in order to be tried? Manifestly not. It was, therefore, clear that they ought, if possible, to provide some tribunal which would act with much greater rapidity than the Local Government Board could act.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0076"/>
<col>139</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00540">But what was more important than all was, could they consider that the Local Government Board was an impartial tribunal in a matter of this kind? It was evidently not an impartial tribunal, and he did not say that by way of criticism of the Board. The Board would, of course, be interested in seeing these schemes of housing reform pushed on all over the country. Inspired by the President of the Board, they would have all the enthusiasm of zealots in the matter of housing reform. He did not blame them in the least for that. Many noble Lords in that House were, in their private capacity, doing something in the same direction, and there was no more fascinating pursuit. He did not quarrel with the Local Government Board for having such a feeling, but this fact, it was evident, deprived them of the quality of impartiality, and unless the tribunal was impartial it might make very serious mistakes and commit very great injustice. He heard only the other day of a local authority who tried to force an owner to execute certain repairs in a cottage belonging to him. The authority said it was unfit for human habitation. What was the matter? There was a tiled shed outside the house which was not sealed underneath the tiles, and the authority said that that made the whole house unfit for human habitation. Their Lordships were also probably familiar with an instance of zeal somewhat outrunning judicial discretion in a matter of this sort in the great City of Birmingham. There had been in that city a tremendous and laudable effort towards housing reform, but, according to information which reached him occasionally, the demands made on landlords altogether outran any reasonable demand which ought to be made. In one case a landowner consulted an architect, and he put the estimate for the repairs at a sum of &#x00A3;300, but the Housing Committee thought it ought to cost &#x00A3;1,500. That showed the sort of difference of opinion there might be on a question of that kind. And although it was not the same Department, he might quote from his own experience of the Board of Agriculture. He was interested in preparing small holdings according to the behests of the noble Earl, but one of the difficulties they had was that the noble Earl's Office held a much more exalted view of what was suitable and fit for the habitation of small holders than the funds that his poor county could afford,
<col>140</col>
and it was only after a great deal of pressure that they were able to persuade the noble Earl that the counsels of perfection should be abated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00541">It was quite clear that in a question of this kind great injustice might be done unless a perfectly impartial mind was brought to bear upon this question. This difficulty had also been felt in regard to an analogous matter in the great metropolis in which they were now speaking. There they had a great Act called the London Building Act, and very difficult questions, not very different from the sort of questions which would have to be decided under this Bill, arose. There were questions of building lines or what constituted sufficient light and air for buildings, but those were not entrusted to a Government Department; there was an appeal to a special tribunal, appointed under the Act, of three gentlemen of distinction. That tribunal gave universal satisfaction, and constituted a great precedent for having a judicial body to determine appeals of this kind. When they came to consider what that judicial body ought to be, two alternatives presented themselves. There were the magistrates and there were the County Court Judges. The magistrates were the present Court of appeal under the principal Act, but it was said, and perhaps with some truth, that magistrates sitting on the Borough Benches were not altogether to be relied upon in matters of that kind. He did not desire to say anything disrespectful to the gentlemen of the Borough Benches, but they were sometimes so much interested in housing matters that it was not fair to throw upon them decisions of this kind. If they turned from Borough Benches to Quarter Sessions, the difficulty was that they only met four times a year, and in the interests of that rapidity which was requisite in these cases Quarter Sessions were not suitable. Therefore they were driven back on the other alternative, the County Court. He could not help thinking that the County Court was the most suitable for matters of this kind. The County Court jurisdiction existed as much for interpreting matters of contract as for anything else, and therefore it seemed to be precisely suitable for giving decisions on these matters. He was sure the Lord Chancellor would be the last person to say anything in derogation of the capacity of County Court Judges, for he had been responsible for a Bill in the present session which would have thrown far more
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0077"/>
<col>141</col>
important duties upon the County Courts than those now proposed. He would remind their Lordships of the contrast in this Bill between the treatment of England and Scotland, attention to which had already been called on the Second Reading. It ought to be emphasised, for it was one of the most astonishing things in this wonderful Bill. In Scotland all these questions arose just as much as they arose in England, but when the Government wanted to provide an appeal in Scotland they did not go to the Local Government Board or any Government Department; they went to a judicial Court. In the present instance they went to the Sheriffs. He was not familiar with Scottish law or procedure, but he understood that a Sheriff corresponded in position and status to an English County Court Judge. Therefore, if he might use so vulgar a phrase, what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander. If a judicial appeal was necessary in Scotland, a judicial appeal was certainly necessary in England.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00543"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said they had had to fight in Ireland for the right of appeal in many Bills brought to that House. The argument used by the Earl of Crewe was that the working of an Act was expedited by a Department dealing with it, and that it was cheaper. Were the people of the country to be ruled in compartments by Departments? It was all very well talking about the disinterestedness of officials in a Department, but what it amounted to was this, that in the case of an appeal the appellants had to appeal from one gentleman sitting in one room to another sitting in another room on the other side of the passage. They had had to fight that kind of thing in Irish Bills, and he hoped the noble Marquess would fight it with regard to this Bill. Scotland had been let off on this question, and had got the right of appeal. Well, Scotland was a very lucky country. It was now proposed in the Amendment to apply the same kind of Departmental appeal to England. Surely it was the right of an Englishman to appeal to the law of his country if he thought he was not rightly treated. As the Lord Chan-
<col>142</col>
cellor was going to speak he hoped that point would be cleared up for them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00544"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is an old saying, <i>Boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem.</i> In other words, every Judge ought to try and get as much authority, power, jurisdiction, and work for the other Judges as he could.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00545"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: It is a very free translation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00546"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I think it is. It is a fairly accurate paraphrase, at any rate. I do not know what view your Lordships have of the different questions under which all the circumstances, even the most trivial of your domestic or your public or civil life, are to be tried solemnly before some tribunal, some Court of law, and that no individual, unless he has judicial authority, is to be considered a suitable person to settle even the smallest matters. It must be very flattering to those who administer justice to think that their services are so much desired by people who, I think, would be much more comfortable without them. What is the subject matter of the appeal? We are all agreed that there should be an appeal. A local authority decides that some house or cottage is not fit for human habitation; or, having decided that, and having spent the money to put it right, the question is whether &#x00A3;20 or &#x00A3;18, or a smaller sum spent on making the house fit for human habitation, is to be recovered from the landlord. It might be &#x00A3;15 or even &#x00A3;30. Now, it is proposed by the noble Marquess that this matter should be treated by a County Court Judge as a trial, as a point of litigation.<lb/>
The noble Marquess gave three reasons. First, he said that the procedure, which he described as a judicial procedure, was preferable to the report of a practical man sent down for the purpose. He has provided nothing in the way of procedure. We shall have to have Rules of Court, with solicitors, and, perhaps, expert witnesses called in regard to this particular shanty or building, and a solemn trial before a County Court Judge, lasting perhaps half a day or more, as to whether a particular house is unfit for human habitation, by reason, for example, of its having a shed outside, to follow the illustration which the noble Marquess gave.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0078"/>
<col>143</col>
Is it not driving it a little bit too far? Why is a Judge of the County Court more suited to decide that than anybody else? What does he know more than any one else about a house being fit for human habitation or not fit? He must take evidence, for you are making this a subject of a trial and litigation in the Courts. I do not deprecate litigation, but this is a Bill which, if overloaded by expense, will baffle the object which I believe the noble Marquess wishes to see carried out as much as any one&#x2014;namely, to remove a great social evil. So much for the procedure. I am afraid if the noble Marquess persists, which I hope he will not, he will have to provide some code of procedure to enable County Court Judges to deal with this.<lb/>
The next reason the noble Marquess gave was despatch. That, again, I take to be highly complimentary to the profession to which I have the honour to belong. The law's delays are no longer proverbial. It is the despatch which has become proverbial, and stimulates the noble Marquess in desiring a judicial decision instead of having a man sent down in the morning to look at a place and settle the affair in ten minutes and come back again in the afternoon. That is the state of dignity to which we have arrived. I have the greatest respect for County Court Judges, and had not the noble and learned Earl defeated me their jurisdiction would have been extended. But I must say that they have not the particular qualification for deciding whether a cottage is healthy or not; nor have they any excessive time for disposing of this kind of thing. There are a good many insanitary houses. Are these Judges to be sent about the country from their work to view these, and then have trials on the subject?<lb/>
The third ground upon which the noble Marquess asked for support to his Amendment was that he wanted somebody who was impartial. There, again, I acknowledge the compliment. The County Court Judges are impartial. But are they the only people who are impartial? He spoke of the fiery enthusiasm of the present President of the Board, and suggested that, however comparatively dull the occupation of the officials might be, it would be kindled into enthusiasm by the proximity of the right hon. gentleman. Surely the noble Marquess knows that these things are
<col>144</col>
done constantly under another Act, to which I will refer, and they are just as much a matter of right as anything could be. Can you imagine any one getting unduly excited by being sent 100 miles off on the question as to whether a cottage is fit for human habitation? A duller or a more uninteresting and prosaic business I cannot imagine, and it is a business at the same time which is eminently suitable for a practical man. I am not suggesting that County Court Judges may not be practical in the legal way of weighing evidence and so forth if you have a trial, but I think this would be better done by a surveyor or an official sent down from the Board. It is said that these men are not impartial, but is this such a great matter that you are going to introduce all this legal paraphernalia? The last part of the noble Marquess's speech referred to the Sheriffs in Scotland. I am happy to be on ground with which I ought to be a little familiar. The Sheriff in Scotland, and my noble friend, Lord Camperdown, will bear me out, is a man who does about twice the work of a County Court Judge in England for half the salary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00547"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00548"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: If I were asked to characterise his position it would be in terms of sympathy, for it is really true, He does not merely the work of a stipendiary magistrate, but the county court work; he does the work of a Justice of the Peace also, and he has other functions, executive functions, and it is because he has these executive functions that I suppose he was put into this Bill. There was a case of a raid in the Highlands some time ago in which, I remember, a Sheriff, according to his legal duty, commanded the police, and marched with them, and I believe complaint was made that he distributed medals to them for their prowess in the course of their expedition. He is the head of the police, I believe, and has judicial and executive functions mixed, and that system prevails only because of the peculiar experience and the pacific attitude of the people among whom he lives. You must not take the Sheriff as being in the least degree parallel to an English County Court Judge. He is put into the Bill partly because in Scotland they have not got a Local Government Board.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00550"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Not the same as in England. The Sheriff is appointed partly because he is, in point of fact, an executive as well as a judicial officer. The real point is this. We want to keep this thing cheap in administration. We do not want to multiply its operations. It has been this which has caused the ruin of previous schemes of housing reform. Expense has killed the whole business, and though I am sure this Amendment is proposed with the very best motives by the noble Marquess, the real effect would be to increase the expense in regard to such a small matter. I think you may trust the Local Government Board and the officials to say whether a house is sanitary or not. They have already this power under Section 268 of the Public Health Act, 1875, which has been in force for thirty years. There is an appeal to the Local Government Board, and, as far as I know, no one has been aggrieved by the decisions in regard to recovering money with respect to private improvements, and the question whether those particular expenses are private improvement expenses or not. That kind of thing has been familiarly dealt with without objection. I hope your Lordships will not press this Amendment. If you do it will make the matter very much more expensive, and do a lot of harm to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00551"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that the appeal of the Lord Chancellor brought him to his feet. It was perfectly true that the Sheriff was maid-of-all-work in Scotland. But was he so superior to the English County Court Judge? This work was done by the Sheriff in Scotland because the Sheriff was able to be impartial. But they would never make the people of England believe that a great Department so closely interested in the Government, and the head of the Department very often an enthusiast, could be quite as impartial? With regard to the question of expense, that, after all, was a very small matter. It was desirable to have cheapness, but in taking a man's property away from him justice was more important even than cheapness.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00552"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said the real analogy was Sections 32 to 34 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, to which reference had often been made.
<col>146</col>
There, where orders were made, the appeal was to Quarter Sessions, and no steps could be taken until the appeal had been determined. The principle of the appeal to the Court had in kindred circumstances been recognised by the Legislature over and over again, and no question of delay or expense had been allowed to interfere with the right which all His Majesty's subjects had to have their property in such cases protected by a Court of law. He would call attention to the section to which the Lord Chancellor referred, Section 258 of the Public Health Act, which gave the right to memorialise the Local Government Board in cases in which a person was aggrieved by a decision as to private improvement expenses. That was the only jurisdiction given to the Local Government Board under that Act. It was true that that section had worked perfectly well, but he did not think there had been many cases.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00553"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Hundreds of cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00554"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said that they were of that limited class dealing with the cost of private improvements. The question was not whether the money should come out of the pocket of the landlord, but whether it should be put on the general body of ratepayers as against a particular body of ratepayers. There was no analogy in the present case where they were dealing with the particular rights of an individual whose property was being interfered with. Why was it that where an appeal to Quarter Sessions was allowed under one Act, nothing was put into this clause except an appeal to the Local Government Board? During the twelve years he was Attorney-General he had had a great deal of experience of the Local Government Board, and he submitted that it was not right in dealing with a matter of this kind, where the local authorities were acting either by the direction or with the consent of the Local Government Board, that the appeal should be to that Board. The Lord Chancellor had said that this could be done by a gentleman going down from London and would be done very expeditiously, but that was not business. What did they do now? The whole of England and Scotland was parcelled out, and, with great deference to noble Lords from Scotland, he held that there was a direct analogy between the jurisdiction
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0080"/>
<col>147</col>
of the Sheriff in Scotland in these civil matters and the County Courts in England, and the amusing and interesting speech of the Lord Chancellor about a Sheriff going out into the Highlands with a body of police and suppressing a raid and giving medals to the police had nothing to do with the questions they were discussing, which was as to the jurisdiction which the Sheriff exercised with regard to appeals, and whether it was applicable to this Bill. He appealed to Viscount Wolverhampton who, he was sure, with his experience of County Courts, would see that if there was to be an appeal at all it ought to be to men who were in the locality. The expense in a County Court was far less than would be incurred in going to Quarter Sessions. Would the Government suggest some other tribunal? They on that side of the House felt that subjects of His Majesty had the right to the protection of the Court. That seemed to be the principle which ought to cover this, and unless some reason was given for departing from it they ought to adhere to it. Would the Government give them some other tribunal to appeal to? If they liked to set up some cheap tribunal well and good, but if they said "No, it must be the Local Government Board and nothing else," it seemed to him that the noble Marquess had made a case for the Amendment. The point was that they should have a cheap appeal to a legal tribunal, in which no barrister need be employed, and in which the introduction of expert witnesses would cost only a few pounds &#x2014;they got no more in the County Courts. He was supporting the Amendment because in his judgment it was wrong that a Board sitting in an office should decide these questions between a local authority and an individual. An independent tribunal was asked for, and in default of a better one being suggested by His Majesty's Government he hoped the Committee would adopt the County Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00555"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have really practically nothing to add to what was said by my friend behind me, because Lord Alverstone did not deal with the arguments advanced by my noble and learned friend, but confined himself to the general statement that in all cases where there was any question which might arise between a local authority and an individual there should be an appeal to a judicial tribunal. I think the noble
<col>148</col>
and learned Lord would have contributed more to the debate if he had attempted to meet the arguments advanced by the Lord Chancellor in respect to the peculiar unfitness of the County Courts, admirable institutions as they are, for the particular purposes required of them by this section. Lord Alverstone spoke in a vague and general way as though vast powers were being conferred on the Local Government Board under this section. What does the section deal with? It deals with the necessary conditions of keeping in repair certain classes of houses defined under this Act. As the Lord Chancellor pointed out, the questions which may arise under this section will very often be, and in the vast majority of cases are, of a small and unimportant character, and to say that if such a question arises it is necessary to call in all the majesty of a judicial tribunal I confess does not seem to me entirely reasonable. I believe if you were to ask the people who will be affected by this clause as it stands whether they would sooner have the question decided by a Local Government Board Inspector than be dragged before a County Court, with all the publicity involved in the face of their neighbours and all the comments which would arise in their small local newspapers, they would infinitely prefer the procedure proposed in the Bill quite apart from all questions of expense. Lord Alverstone said, "If you won't have a County Court, have something else." The noble Marquess who introduced this Amendment pointed out, with great clearness and absolute candour, the objections that might arise in some cases in allowing the county, or, even more, a Borough Bench to adjudicate on these questions. I agree with him. The Borough Benches do, no doubt, include a great number of people upon whom, as the noble Marquess pleasantly put it, it is not fair to place the burden of adjudicating on these matters, in which we presume they may be interested. No attempt has been made to prove that the County Court is a suitable body for this particular purpose. At any rate, no attempt has been made to answer the statements of the Lord Chancellor; and it does seem to be rather incumbent on the critics of the Bill to suggest some alternative course. I confess I do not see what alternative kind of appeal could be suggested, and I fear, therefore, that we must adhere to the proposals made in our clause, and we do so all the more confidently owing to the fact that we
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0081"/>
<col>149</col>
do not consider that they have met with any damaging criticism whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00556"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> said he had listened to the Lord Chancellor, but was bound to say that he had not heard the argument to which the noble Earl had just referred, which suggested that the County Court was not a fit tribunal to hear these appeals. No one knew better than the noble and learned Lord that questions such as the amount of repairs, whether or not they would make a place habitable, and so on, were questions which must constantly come before County Court Judges. To say that the County Court Judge was not a competent person&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00557"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned Earl, but it was not a question of the competency of the person; it was a question of the machinery.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00558"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> was afraid he did not understand what the machinery was. The question was whether or not this could go to the County Court. What question of machinery, or difficulty of machinery, arose? If there was an appeal, it was to a County Court in a particular district, and he was not aware of the necessity for any new rules of procedure. There were plenty of rules now, perhaps too many, with reference to the regulation of proceedings in County Courts, but he did not understand that the noble and learned Lord suggested any difficulty about procedure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00559"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: All I said was that you would have to have, rules, or some machinery, provided in the Bill to enable a County Court Judge to try these appeals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00560"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> said that, with the greatest possible respect, he did not follow what the Government really meant. There was no difficulty in saying under this Statute that there should be an appeal to the County Court. There were rules at present which regulated all appeals to the County Court, and he did not know anything which distinguished this from any other matter which went on appeal to the County Court. One would suppose there was something very mysterious about this question. The Lord Chancellor said it was not worth while going to a County Court, or any Court, over such a question. But if a person owed another sixpence, he could
<col>150</col>
go to the County Court and enforce his right there, and he had never yet heard that the procedure was so expensive as to prevent justice being done. He confessed he had not followed the argument which the Lord Chancellor presented on this matter. He regarded this as a far more serious matter than was applicable to this particular Amendment. He quite followed what Lord Alverstone had said with perfect propriety. This was a right which had been fought for over and over again in this country, the right of a person to have his property protected against any arbitrary act by the Government, and to have the matter fought out in a Court of Law. Even if there had been one or two small instances where it was not thought worth while to do this, that ought not to prevent these appeals going to a judicial tribunal instead of to a Government Department. He was bound to say that their late experience of Government Departments was not very favourable to the system of appeal now proposed by the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00561"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said that in the vast majority of cases the tribunal in the Bill would be sufficient, but what about the minority of cases? Those were also important. He did not see why landlords should not have the option of appealing to the Local Government Board or to a Court, as the noble Marquess suggested. There might be some inexpensive cases where the owner would be satisfied, but in the minority of cases there might be instances in which he would not consider that the Board was impartial, and he might like to have another tribunal to appeal to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00562"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> said that in all these small cases the owner would shrink from the expenses of the County Court, and would consent to pay what he was told he had to pay. The County Court would cost money. As the Bill stood, in these cases the Local Government Board Inspector would go down and there would be no expense. By the Amendment they were defeating the object of the Bill. If it came to going before a County Court and fighting it in the open, the owner would merely shrug his shoulders and pay. Only the few cases really worth fighting would come before a County Court Judge. As a compromise he thought that either the Local Government Board or the County Court should be able to hear an appeal. They
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0082"/>

could then let the owner decide under which king he chose to die.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00574"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> moved to leave out subsection (5). He said this really raised a question which had been dealt with to some extent on the previous evening, but the expression "landlord" as defined here would lead to endless difficulty. He had already pointed out what the case would be with large collieries, and the noble Earl promised to consider that question. There were many other cases which would make a provision of this kind very awkward. Take the not uncommon case of a house or a set of houses being built and let out to an association, perhaps to a very wealthy association. It might not be a question of poverty at all, and the landlord perhaps had left to that association the maintenance of those houses. Why was the landlord to be liable for the repair of the houses if the association neglected its duty? Yet it seemed to him that the subsection would make the landlord liable in that way. The object which His Majesty's Government had in view&#x2014;they
<col>154</col>
all sympathised with it&#x2014;was to get hold of the landlord who let houses to men of straw, and then when those houses got out of repair shielded himself under a bogus contract with his tenant; but surely some words were required to except the cases he had mentioned, where there was a <i>bona fide</i> association, and where the person to whom the houses were let was perfectly able to keep them in repair. The landlord ought not to be liable in such a case. With regard to the expression "house" including "part of a house," what did that mean? Did it mean a tenement house, or a house let in flats. He was informed that houses in some parts of the country let in flats were considered to be tenement houses. That seemed to him to be rather a stretch of the term. The whole subsection required clearing up, and he thought it should be omitted here, and perhaps brought in in some other section.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00576"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said there was no point of difference between the noble Duke and the Government. This section provided that the expression "landlord" meant any person who lets a house. It was quite obvious that the original owner was not involved, but it was the person who let the house who would become liable. If on further inquiry the noble Duke was not satisfied with what he understood to be the legal aspect of the case, perhaps the noble Duke would bring up something on Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00577"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> expressed the opinion that some further words were required. He thought the words "the expression 'landlord' means any person who lets the house under any contract referred to in this section, and includes his successors in title, and the expression 'house' includes part of a house," were rather too wide. He was sure the Government meant the same thing, but words were wanted to show that it was a letting for habitation by the working-classes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00578"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he would certainly see that the matter was looked into. He had for the moment overlooked the noble Duke's second question. He thought that tenements would be included under this section.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00582"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the Local Government Board was not disposed to accept the Amendment in this case. He agreed that this clause was in the usual form, but Section 91 of the Act of 1890 said, "All powers shall be deemed to be in addition to and not in derogation of any other powers conferred by Act of Parliament." Section 341 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and Section 11 of the Public Health (Amendment) Act of 1897 referred to a somewhat similar case. The Local Government Board wanted to keep the words in.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00583"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that the Local Government Board were always glad to keep in any words which implied an addition of any sort. The difficulty arose from the fact that if they used the words "in addition to and not in derogation of," it might mean that a man could collect a debt or something of that sort twice over. One really had a certain suspicion of the Local Government Board. He would not, however, trouble their Lordships to divide upon the Amendment.</p>

<col>156</col>
addition to or in substitution for any other person having an interest in the premises, and prescribing the circumstances and conditions in and subject to which any such duty is to be discharged.</quote>

<quote>(3) Where an owner or other person has failed to execute any work which he has been required to execute under the by-laws, the local authority or sanitary authority, as the case may be, may, after giving to him not less than fourteen days' notice in writing, themselves execute the works and recover the costs and expenses, and for that purpose the provisions of subsection (3) of the last foregoing section, with respect to the execution of works and the recovery of expenses by local authorities, shall apply as if the owner or other person were the landlord and with such other adaptations as may be necessary."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00587"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said his Amendment to this clause was somewhat of a technical nature, but he thought it was not an unimportant one. Under the Bill it seemed that the definition of an owner excluded all mortgagees and all lessees of terms under twenty-one years. Therefore a lessee under a repairing lease of seven or fourteen years could not be touched for the execution of works, and it seemed desirable that the responsibility of lessees should not be abrogated by an Act of Parliament without good reason. Of course, in a good many of these cases tenements which were occupied by the working-classes were in possession, so to speak, of several people. There was the original owner, or the ground landlord; there were sometimes mortgagees or a lessee, and the occupier had himself the responsibility of keeping the place in repair. The object of his Amendment was to secure that the person, although perhaps not the owner in the sense of being the ground landlord or the original owner of the premises, should not escape the responsibilities which he had undertaken to carry out.</p>

<image src="S5LV0003P0I0085"/>
<col>157</col>
If he would follow a line or two further in the Bill he would find the words, "in addition to or in substitution for any other person having an interest in the premises." It was clear the occupier was one of those persons who had an interest in the premises, and therefore the occupier was already covered by the words in the clause. This, again, was one of those matters in which there was no difference of principle. It was merely a matter of drafting, and he thought their Lordships would see that these words would not add anything to the strength of the Bill in view of the fact that the line he had read was sufficiently wide to cover the occupier.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00591"><member>VISCOUNT HILL</member> moved an Amendment to provide that any notice requiring the execution of works under this clause should be served upon the owner or other person in writing. Under the Public Health Acts from 1875 to 1891 he believed there was a provision of this kind, that the owners should be served with notice, and he desired to know whether a sufficient notice was provided for in this Bill. If not, he would ask the noble Earl whether he would insert these words so as to make it perfectly clear that the owner was to receive this notice of the requirements to be executed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00593"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that the noble Viscount could rest satisfied that the owner or other person was already protected. It had been held by the High Court that any by-law which did not contain a provision of notice being given to a landlord was bad, and therefore it was already the law that notice of this kind must be given. But the model by-law drafted by the Local Government Board provided that no proceedings could be taken against the landlord until he had had that notice, and the Local Government Board always insisted upon a clause to that effect being inserted in by-laws. Clause 16 was not really intended to cover any very important points. It was inserted in order to meet a state of things
<col>158</col>
which arose in a London borough, in which an owner was ordered to effect certain repairs of a very small and not at all a serious character, but he claimed that he had no right of entry because of the terms of his agreement. The Court sustained the claim, and the object of this clause was to make it quite clear that the owner should at all times have a reasonable right of entry. He thought that the noble Viscount might rest satisfied with the statement that in the opinion of the Board the case was already covered by the existing law.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00618"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> desired to ask the noble Earl a question as to the extent of this clause. If he would look in the fourth line he would see the words "whether any dwelling-house therein is in a state so dangerous," and so on. Did that word "dwelling-house" extend to all dwelling-houses, or was it limited to dwelling-houses which were under Clause 14 of the Act? His reason for asking was
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0087"/>
<col>161</col>
that in the debate on the Second Reading it had been said that it would very likely affect a good many of their servants' rooms, and that those rooms would be held to be unfit for human habitation. That had been called into question, and he asked for a correct interpretation of the term.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00619"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that the correct interpretation without any doubt was that it applied to all dwelling-houses and not merely to those in Clause 14.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00620"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member> moved an Amendment to provide that instead of an inspection of houses being made "from time to time" it should be made at least triennially, and by the medical officer of health. He thought the words "from time to time" were far too vague to be really effective. They might mean almost anything. With a zealous or active district council they might mean an annual house to house inspection, but in the case of a negligent council, who from any cause was not very active or enthusiastic, the words might mean something very different. Therefore it was reasonable to fix some time which would ensure regular inspection. They were all agreed as to the importance of having something like a regular and continuous inspection and not a casual or haphazard inspection, varying simply with the character of the district council and their officers. It was where those bodies or individuals were not active or enthusiastic that it was of the first importance that the Statute should be explicit and lay upon them a reasonable call to do their duty regularly. With regard to the second part of his Amendment he felt it was of real importance that it should be explicitly made a part of the duty of medical officers of health to carry out this inspection if called upon. It seemed to be one of the weak spots in this Bill that the district councils and their officers were not very clearly dealt with. The Bill dealt quite distinctly with county councils and with the county council officers, but it seemed largely to leave the district councils and their officers alone. Whatever abuse was likely to arise would be brought about as a rule, not from any lack of vigilance on the part of county councils, but in the smaller rural district councils. The Bill would have been greatly improved, he thought, if more attention had been given to the district councils, and especially to the appointment of
<col>162</col>
medical officers of health under district councils, On that point he was glad to see in Clause 69 an Amendment proposed by Lord Harrowby, which would tend to make medical officers of health to district councils more independent than hitherto. It tended to paralyse an officer if he was only appointed by the year or for three years, and if at the end of three years, when the constitution of the council was changed, he might be turned out for somebody else. It was also certainly not to the advantage of any administration that such medical officers should be carrying on a private practice at the same time in their respective districts. For all these reasons he hoped their Lordships would be willing to lay explicitly on the medical officer of health to a district council the duty of carrying out the regular inspection of the houses in his district. With regard to the whole matter, perhaps he might be allowed to refer to Germany. There were a good many things in German administration which deserved their attention, and this matter of continuous inspection of dwelling-houses was one of them. In many of the German States continuous inspection was compulsory, and the rules were far more stringent than anything proposed in this Bill. In several of the States there were not only district inspectors, but a chief inspector whose duty it was to see that these continuous inspections were carried out, and to make an annual report on his own inspecting work, and on the work of all the sub-inspectors. He observed also that in some States they were even making provision for adding duly qualified women to assist in this inspection. If the Bill was to be worked efficiently in various districts&#x2014;and he was thinking specially of his own district&#x2014;it was very important to secure regularity of inspection. It was also important to secure, as far as might be, the independence of the medical officer, so that he should be outside all local interests, and he thought the medical officer should have the definite duty laid upon him of carrying out this inspection. For those reasons he moved his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00622"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> was sorry to say that he found himself in an unfortunate position with regard to the Amendment of the right rev. Prelate. He was unable to accept it any more than the Amendment the right rev. Prelate moved on the previous night. In the first place, there was this to be said, that what was wanted was really a continuous inspection which should be efficient to make sure that all the houses were in a state of sanitary repair. That did not mean that every house should be inspected at exactly the same interval. Triennially would, perhaps, be too often for some houses, while for others it would not be frequent enough. In the case of the Bishop's palace at Hereford, triennially perhaps would be too often, but at the same time there might be cottages in his Lordship's diocese where triennial inspection would not be enough. What was wanted was not a perfunctory inspection every three years, but a more general and thorough inspection carried out according to the various needs of the different houses in different districts. With regard to the second part of the Amendment, the difficulty seemed to be that it would lay upon the medical officer himself the duty of making the actual inspection, which in a large matter of this kind would be really impracticable. The inspection ought to be made by the sanitary inspectors, acting under the medical officer, who would be called in before there was any serious question, and before any representation under Clause 17 was made to the local authority. But to lay the duty upon the medical officer himself would be impracticable.</p>

He said that if the clause was restricted to houses which were dangerous or injurious to health there might be many houses of that description occupied by very healthy inhabitants. In parts of the Highlands, for example, if the sanitary inspector did his duty, at least half of the houses there would be declared injurious to health. Yet from many of those houses there came out well-dressed and extremely healthy looking persons, and the proprietor would say, "how can the house be injurious to health when a healthy looking person of that kind has been living in it?" But he would leave it to the noble Earl to do what he liked with his Amendment.</p>

The Local Government Board, for instance, made regulations prescribing the duties of various officers of the local authorities, not only under the Public Health Act but also under the Poor Law Acts, and those drafts were not required to be laid before Parliament. The term in the clause was that regulations would be made and that records might be prescribed. The idea of the Local Government Board was that those records were quite likely to vary according to the different places. In one district there would be one record, and in another district, the conditions being different, there would be another sort of record, and a considerable number of those records would be issued for use in various districts. It would be very inconvenient to lay records of that kind before Parliament, and in view of the fact that the Local Government Board already had power to issue similar regulations without recourse to Parliament, he ventured to hope their Lordships would agree to continue that power under the Bill.</p>

<col>166</col>
simultaneously with it. If the closing order was issued on the application of the local authority it would presumably be with regard to a house which ought to cease to be occupied altogether, and before making the order the local authority ought to have satisfied themselves that the case was not one which could be dealt with either under Clause 15 of the Bill, or under the nuisance provisions of the Public Health Act. The local authorities, he thought, would be very unwilling to have cast upon them, and their Lordships ought to be unwilling also to throw upon them, the duty of drawing up a series of specifications for houses which were in bad condition.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00639"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> moved to insert in subsection (3), after "owner," the words "or occupier." This Amendment did seem to him to be a reasonable one to suggest to their Lordships, because it dealt with an order which might be made to close a house that was unfit for occupation. After all, the occupier was the person chiefly interested in the matter, he was the person who lived in the house, and it was for his benefit that the closing order was made. He thought, therefore, that it was really only fair to the occupier that he should receive as much notice as was possible. In subsection (4) it was provided that "Where a closing order has become operative, the local authority shall serve notice of the order on every occupying tenant of the dwelling-house"; but he supposed there might be an interval between the closing order being made and its actually becoming operative. After all, it was a very simple point, but it did not seem to him quite fair that the occupier of the house who, as he had just said, was the person principally interested in the matter, should not have notice, as well as the owner of the house, that it was to be closed.</p>

posing the words "or occupier" were inserted, it would then be possible to serve notice on the owner or the occupier. The owner was the person who ought to have notice, and not the occupier, and if the notice were served only upon the occupier, as would be possible under the Amendment, it would not reach the owner. Then there was the further point that if the owner's appeal was successful the house would not be closed at all, the order would not become necessary, and the occupier would have been disturbed in his mind unnecessarily. He used that argument because under similar circumstances when notice had been given to occupiers as well as to owners&#x2014;he referred to certain procedure under the Public Health Acts&#x2014;the occupiers immediately became very much disturbed in their minds and began to leave, and that was rather a hardship on the owner if the closing order did not afterwards become operative. He thought the suggestion of the noble Lord, that there would be a real grievance on the part of the occupier, was hardly borne out by the lengthy procedure under the section. First of all, notice of the closing order was given, then the closing order became operative, and then, finally, as their Lordships would see in subsection (4), when it had become operative, the local authority had to serve notice on every occupying tenant, who was then given not less than seven days to vacate the premises.

It ought to be quite easy for the owner to make up his mind in fourteen days whether he wished to appeal, and a house which was presumably unfit for human habitation would be occupied all that time. In those circumstances, he hoped the noble Lord would allow the fourteen days to remain in the Bill.</p>

He said that this Amendment was on a totally different footing, because where a dwelling-house had to be closed the tenant was forthwith without any warning called upon to make a sudden move. He was told that in seven days he must leave his house which had been declared to be uninhabitable. Some of their Lordships might have more intimate acquaintance than he had with the condition of this class of tenants, but it did seem to him that it might be very difficult for a tenant in seven days to find another habitation. In those circumstances, to give the unfortunate tenant only a week's notice of removal was too short, especially as, according to the explanation of the noble Earl, all knowledge of the fact that the house was about to be closed was withheld from him, because he would not have had the information that the closing order was in process of being appealed against.</p>

Seven days was the limit under the existing law. They were dealing here with houses which were unfit for human habitation, not with tenants who were worthy of any special consideration. The sooner they were turned out of such houses the better. In
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0091"/>
<col>169</col>
the Act of 1890, the period specified was "not less than seven days." The noble Lord would see that it was also "not less than seven days" in the Bill before them, and under those circumstances, he ventured to hope that their Lordships would agree to allow the clause to remain as it was.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00651"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> did not think the noble Earl in charge of the Bill quite realised the difficulties in some parts of the country that working people laboured under in obtaining substitutes for the cottages which they were compelled to leave. The invariable excuse offered by tenants who did not leave was that they had been looking about for another cottage, and that they had been quite unable to find one, and as long as they could give that excuse it seemed to be considered a valid one. He thought that the period of seven days was too short.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00652"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WAKEFIELD</member> said that in his experience of very many cases of really deserving poor people in some of the large towns&#x2014;not the largest, although he dared say the same thing existed in the largest, but towns of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants&#x2014;many of such people had found it practically impossible within, not seven days or fourteen days, but within six or eight or even ten weeks, to find any habitation whatever in certain places where there was a real scarcity of working class dwellings. If it was at all possible to extend the seven days to fourteen days, he would venture on that ground alone to ask the noble Earl if be could see his way to make the Act a little more merciful.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00653"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> was rather surprised to hear the noble Earl say that tenants who lived in houses which were unfit for human habitation were not deserving of sympathy. Did His Majesty's Government know so little of the conditions of the very people they were professing to try and better that they classed them as criminals because they happened to be living in houses which were unfit for human habitation? The great difficulty was that in many towns overcrowding was the rule, and not only overcrowding but overcrowding in houses which were unfit for human habitation, and there was nowhere else for those unfortunate people to go. It was all very well for His Majesty's Government to assume, in their superior knowledge, that a tenant knew that
<col>170</col>
his house was unfit for human habitation. He was sorry to say that a great many people in this world were brought up from their earliest days in houses which were unfit for human habitation, and never realised the fact that they were unfit, and they were going to put in a power to a local authority to turn those people out into the street, or into the workhouse, at seven days notice&#x2014;people who, if he might be allowed to say so, were in many cases quite as respectable as those in much happier circumstances. A man was to be turned out although his work might lay close to where he dwelt in his insanitary house, and although there was no other unoccupied habitation within reach of his work. Supposing such a man had not very much margin, and was not able to buy a bicycle or to pay tram or train fares, why should he be put to the hardship of having to move perhaps a considerable distance away from where his work lay? Another case, which occurred to one at once, was where there might be sickness or invalids in the house. Why were they not to have more than seven days within which to find another habitation? The answer of the noble Earl would be that the clause said, "Not less than seven days." But he was going to entrust to the local authority the power of turning a man out at seven days, and it was only the discretion of the local authority that had to stand between the occupier and a very great hardship. He did not think they should be entrusted with a power quite so drastic as the noble Earl wished.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00654"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is not a very large question. It really is a question of what is the balance of humanity towards these unfortunate people. I do not think it strikes one as certain that to leave people in houses unfit for human habitation longer than you can help is of itself a particularly humane proceeding and therefore, I suppose we should all agree that the period ought to be made as short as possible. As my noble friend behind me pointed out, the existing law does include this provision of not less than seven days, and no one has quoted cases of special hardship that have arisen under it. It is also a material fact, as the noble Duke pointed out, that it is a minimum; it is not a fixed term. He objects to such a discretion being left to the local authority.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00658"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> proposed that "a person shall not be convicted of an offence under this subsection if he shows that, having regard to his circumstances and means of livelihood, he has, after making all reasonable endeavours to secure other house accommodation, failed to do so." He hoped that as the previous Amendment had been accepted the noble Earl would be willing to accept his proviso also. Surely it did seem absurd to put into any Act of Parliament a clause suggesting that any working man should be fined such a sum as 20<i>s:</i> a day. Of course they knew the working men under the Bill were men presumably in receipt of large incomes because they might be inhabiting houses of &#x00A3;40 or &#x00A3;50 a year, and some of them, perhaps, might think it worth their while to pay an additional rent in the shape of a penalty of &#x00A3;1 a day solely for the privilege of living in an uninhabitable house. Was it fair to fine any working man 20<i>s.</i> a day, or to impose any penalty at all on him, for remaining in a house, not because he wanted to remain in it, but because he could not get out of it? He thought the noble Lord should give more consideration to cases where a man, really <i>bona fide,</i> could not possibly find a house elsewhere. It was possible, of course, in some cases that by leaving the district altogether a man might find a house elsewhere, but were they going to condemn him to give up his employment, and go into a district with which he was unacquainted, with a possibility of his having to go through some period of unemployment there? He really thought the noble Earl should venture to give some consideration to cases of that kind.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00660"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought the fact that their Lordships had already agreed to make the term fourteen days instead of seven would have been an argument against going any further. The Amendment of the noble Lord went a very long way indeed. Supposing a tenant disobeyed the order to vacate a house which was condemned as unfit for human habitation, what was to happen? Was no limit to be put to the time the tenant might remain in the house? He was afraid that any argument to leave things in an Act of Parliament so that they might hang over the heads of the people concerned was not a very popular one in their Lordships' House, but he ventured to use it in this connection, and to say that if these tenants knew that they were liable to a penalty "not exceeding 20<i>s</i>. a day." they would be more anxious to find accommodation than if they knew they would merely have to satisfy the provisions of the Amendment. Their Lordships had already extended the existing law, which provided for not less than seven days; they had extended that in all cases to fourteen days, and he ventured, therefore, to deprecate an Amendment which would allow these people to live more than fourteen days in a house which was unfit for human habitation. Fourteen days was as long as they ought to allow them to remain.</p>

I cannot see why because we accepted one Amendment in that direction a few moments ago we should not accept another Amendment of the same kind now. If you look at the wording of my noble friend's Amendment you will see that under it the occupier is required to show that, having regard to his circumstances and means of livelihood, he has, after making all reasonable endeavours to secure other accommodation, failed to do so. That is really putting a very considerable burden of proof upon the occupier, and if he is able to convince the Court that the circumstances are such as are covered by the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0093"/>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00662"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I cannot quite agree with the noble Marquess. What seems to be forgotten is the really great number of persons who have no objection whatever to living in these hopelessly insanitary surroundings. The noble Marquess says that a heavy burden of proof is placed on the tenant to show that he ought not to be convicted. What would happen would be that he would make an appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i> to the Court saying that he had tramped about the streets all day looking for a house and had found none. That would be the amount of proof which he would be able to give, and it is very difficult to see what other kind of proof he could give. I am afraid that the Amendment would operate as an encouragement to a very unsatisfactory class of tenant to make no real effort to find accommodation elsewhere, and the result would be that he would drag on for an indefinite period as an inmate of these insanitary premises. I am bound to say if anybody could show to the satisfaction of the Court that there was no accommodation in the neighbourhood at all, that would be an admirable reason for not convicting the man. But that is not quite the case. The sort of appeal which would be made, as I say, would be simply the statement that the man had wandered about trying to find rooms or a house and had not been able to find one. But if there was independent evidence, and if any one came forward after the manner of the right rev. Prelate and said there was no accommodation available, then I think it certainly would be a case for not imposing a penalty. The noble Lord's Amendment seems to me to go a great deal further than that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00663"><member>LORD BELPER</member> hardly thought the Amendment would do as it stood, because there was no limit of time mentioned in it. The tenant would make the plea in the first instance that he could not find other accommodation, and he would plead it again a fortnight afterwards, and perhaps again and again, and the result would be that the law would practically be set aside. It would be impossible to carry it out because there was this lax mode of action
<col>174</col>
which it appeared to him was encouraged by the noble Lord's Amendment. If the tenant could prove that there was a necessity for his having some short period in addition to the period already given, that might be a case in which it might be desirable to give an extension; but to insert a general Amendment without putting in any limit of time at all would simply be to encourage an evasion of the law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00664"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> was sorry he could not agree with the noble Earl. The case he had in mind was where a man could not get accommodation elsewhere. The noble Earl said that the tenant might make an appeal <i>ad misericordiam,</i> and say he had travelled about day after day and could not find a house. But that surely would not be accepted if it was not true; the local authority would know whether the man was able to get other accommodation or not. They were perfectly able to judge whether such an appeal was reasonable or not. Was it worth while putting in a penalty which they could not possibly enforce, whether it was &#x00A3;1 a day or 1s. a day, or less? With such a class of people it was impossible to enforce the penalty. But his main argument was that they must have more consideration for these people and give them a reasonable chance of remaining even in the worst houses rather than put them and their families into the street.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00665"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> said it appeared to him there was one view which His Majesty's Government had overlooked. He could quite understand what the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had said with reference to the continuance of the condition of things which it was desired to get rid of; but this was creating a criminal offence. When the noble Earl said that if the man could prove that there was no other accommodation available it would be a case for not imposing the penalty, he was condemning the clause, because the man ought to be convicted as the clause stood unless he could show and did show that he had not committed any offence. That was the whole point. The clause created a criminal offence in the first place, and although the man was able to prove that he was unable to obtain other accommodation and showed that he had done all he could to avoid that which was made the subject of the penalty,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0094"/>
<col>175</col>
if the Statute was allowed to stand as it did, no amount of appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i> would do, because he had committed an offence and must be convicted. It would be very hard in the event of a man not having intended to commit any offence, and not having committed any, that he should be convicted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00666"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WAKEFIELD</member> thought it his duty to say that from his experience he could not possibly support this Amendment. It was one thing to give a man a minimum time in which to find a house where accommodation was difficult to obtain, and quite a different thing to allow him to remain for an indefinite period in a house which was unfit for human habitation. They all had now and again to protect people against themselves and appear to be cruel in order to do them a kindness. He had known cases not of men, but of women, where it had become almost impossible to remove them from dwellings which really were a menace to the health of the neighbourhood, and where they themselves were in such a condition of health that their persons almost were a menace to health. He could not possibly support the Amendment because he thought it went just over the line, so to speak, of reasonable consideration for the very poor, while it placed other people in danger from conditions existing which were injurious to health.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00667"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked what was to happen supposing there was actually no accommodation to be obtained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00668"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> said that in answer to the noble Duke's question he could give an illustration from his own personal experience. In his neighbourhood some time ago a house was declared to be not fit for habitation, and when the tenant was told to go he said he could not because he could not find any other place. The real reason that he could not find any other place was that he was such a disreputable man that nobody would take him as a tenant. His landlord at last got him out, and the end was that he went to the workhouse with his wife and family and remained there some years, which suited him "down to the ground." That was what happened eventually to most of the people who would not go out and said they could not find accommodation; they wanted to be
<col>176</col>
turned out into the street, because they could always find lodgings at the workhouse. That was a case where such a man could say that he had been going about and was unable to find accommodation, and he could get extension after extension.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00669"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked whether he was to take that as the answer of the Government to his question. Was it the Government's intention that these men should go to the workhouse? It seemed to be assumed that all people living in insanitary dwellings were dirty and disreputable. He might say that he knew several people who lived in houses which were insanitary who were by no means dirty. Perhaps he was putting it too strongly, but there were numbers of persons, unfortunately living in houses which were unfit for human habitation, and yet who were good respectable people. He was quite sure he would be borne out in that assertion by any one who knew the conditions in large towns amongst working people. Was it the intention of His Majesty's Government to turn those people into the workhouse if they could not find other accommodation? He understood the noble Earl who led the House to say that if the tenant could not find other accommodation he would have sympathy with him and do something for him, but the Bill did nothing for him. What was to happen if no accommodation could be found? Were the Government going to say that in that case this man was to go to the workhouse?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00670"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> asked whether it was not the fact that the main objects of the Bill were firstly, to provide, if possible, new sanitary dwellings for the working classes, and, secondly, to close existing insanitary buildings. He thought the provision of new sanitary buildings ought to precede very largely the closing of insanitary ones, in order that the people who unfortunately lived in insanitary buildings might find accommodation in new sanitary ones. Meanwhile, until new sanitary buildings existed, which they all he was sure hoped to see existing largely within the next few years, considerable leniency should be shown to the unfortunate people living in the old insanitary dwellings in cases where they really could not find other suitable accommodation. The Amendment really seemed to him a merciful provision, and he hoped the Committee would pass it. Either the

<col>177</col>
noble Earl in charge of the Bill, or the noble Earl the Leader of the House, had just said that people who were living in insanitary buildings ought to take more time and trouble to find better accommodation, but he would point out that it was not very easy for working men who were away at their work all day to be running about looking for new houses. He had risen several times, and he felt he ought to apologise to the Committee for speaking so much on the question, but it was an important one, and he sincerely hoped the Amendment would be passed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00671"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Lord who has just sat down need apologise for having spoken again, because he has indicated what seems to me to be the common sense of this question. The noble Duke asked whether we were of opinion that all persons who had to leave insanitary dwellings ought to proceed at once to the workhouse.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00672"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> pointed out that he added if there was no other accommodation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00673"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: If there was no other accommodation for them. Certainly not, my Lords. But, on the other hand, I can say that there are a number&#x2014;and by no means a small number&#x2014;of persons inhabiting dwellings who would be very much better in the workhouse, such persons as those mentioned by my noble friend behind me. What seems to me to be the common sense of the question is this. You must leave a certain discretion to the local authority. The noble Lord who has just sat down pointed out, as I think very truly, that where there was no accommodation the local authority ought to be less strict. I confess that until the provision of sanitary dwellings has been extended, which this Act is intended to facilitate, if it is really true in a given district that there are no houses available at all, the local authority will have to adopt for the time being a somewhat lower standard in its closing of houses. But I think we must leave that to the discretion of the local authority. It all points to the necessity for the provision of further dwellings in such extreme cases as those that have been mentioned, and for facilitating in every way the provision of new houses under this Bill. Until that is done, it appears to me that the course suggested by the noble Lord is the
<col>178</col>
only one to meet the case, but that does not at all involve, in my judgment, the acceptance of this Amendment, which, on the grounds mentioned by the right rev. Prelate, would open a very dangerous door to every sort of malingering and objectionable practice on the part of the very worst class of tenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00674"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said it seemed to him, with very great deference, that the speech of the noble Earl showed conclusively that some Amendment of the kind was necessary. He could not understand how it was that the Local Government Board had not considered that matter a little more carefully. Assuming an order to be made, they had thought fit to say that the occupier who stayed on was to be liable to a penalty not exceeding 20<i>s.</i> a day. But surely it ought to be some defence if the man proved that he had taken reasonable steps to try and find accommodation elsewhere having regard to his means and had failed to do so. In such a case he ought not to be made liable to pay a penalty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00675"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My assumption was that if there really was no accommodation to be found anywhere near, the local authority would not make the closing order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00676"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> pointed out that that was exactly why he thought the speech of the noble Earl really followed the Amendment. He could quote a score of cases in which, there being a <i>prima facie</i> offence committed, a defence had been by Statute allowed to be given in order to avoid the penalty. It did seem to him in the interests of those poor people, whom he could not regard as criminals, if a man could put forward a defence and prove that he was unable to find another house, that he ought not to be liable to any penalty at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00677"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member> said if noble Lords were endeavouring to assume the functions of an earthly providence in an attempt to secure the well-being of everybody in the State they would find themselves surrounded by the difficulties which attended the workings of providence when undertaken by finite beings. It seemed to him that the community had a perfect right in the case of a man who refused to leave condemned premises on the ground that he
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0096"/>
<col>179</col>
was unable to find other accommodation to protect themselves by insuring his removal from premises which were injurious not only to the occupier but to the community as a whole. He did not think noble Lords would deny that any community would be entitled to close up at once a water supply which was polluted and spreading enteric among those who were drinking it, even although the inhabitants of the place said they could not go anywhere else for their water; and he thought the community ought to have some effective power to remove the tenant and close a house which was admittedly unfit for human habitation, even although the occupier said he could find nowhere else to go. It was another question whether the necessary operation to get the man out should not be some simple mode of eviction such as a landlord would employ. A landlord was perfectly entitled to resume possession of his cottage although the only place the occupier might be able to go and live in might be twenty miles away. The rights of the community to protect itself ought to be as well secured as the rights of property. There might be a question as to what was the best method to select to get an occupant out of an insanitary dwelling; what was the most reasonable and fair and considerate method, but there must be some means of getting him out. Lord Belper and the right rev. Prelate had shown conclusively that if they accepted the Amendment a man might go on from month to month making the excuse that he could not find suitable accommodation, and never go out at all. The words of the Amendment were&#x2014;"having regard to his circumstances and means of livelihood." Magistrates were much more indulgent now, naturally and properly so, than they used to be as to what was reasonable for the means of livelihood. He thought the matter had been somewhat complicated by what had fallen from the noble Lord who sat below him, because he did not think that the occupation of an insanitary house was necessarily accompanied by misconduct on the part of the occupier, or a low type of occupier. There were plenty of people unfortunately, hard-working and self-respecting people, who were forced to live in bad houses, and therefore they must not take it that the presumption was that a bad house necessarily involved a bad occupant. But they knew perfectly well that there were plenty of houses which for the welfare of the community ought to be closed and which the local authority did not
<col>180</col>
close, not because they did not consider they were a source of danger to the neighbourhood but for the reason that they did not know where the people could go to if they were to turn them into the streets. They had plenty of evidence on the Housing Commission of which Sir Charles Dilke was chairman to the effect that local authorities in many cases did not dare to close thoroughly unhealthy slums because there was no place for the people to go to. That operated as a matter of common sense with local authorities, but after a local authority, looking at all the circumstances, had made up their mind that a place was to be closed, they had no business on account of their sympathy for a hard case&#x2014;and of course it was a hard case where a working man did not know where to turn for other accommodation&#x2014;to risk the health of the rest of the community by allowing the man to remain in an insanitary dwelling. Although he agreed that necessary housing accommodation ought to be provided, he could not agree that it should be done by municipal enterprise. Miss Octavia Hill had given them the strongest evidence before the Commission to which he had referred that municipal effort paralysed local individual effort. However, they were bound, first of all, to consider the health of the locality and only secondarily the possible hardship upon an occupier through being compelled to leave his house.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00678"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he felt a good deal of sympathy with the Amendment moved by Lord Clinton, but he also felt the force of the argument addressed to their Lordships by the noble Lord opposite. If a house was unfit for human habitation he really did not see how it was a kindness to the occupier of that house, or that it was right for the community, to allow the house to be continually occupied by anybody. He thought in a case of that kind the house ought to be closed, and though he quite admitted with his noble friend that there might be hard cases where it was impossible for the occupier to find accommodation elsewhere, yet he was afraid the Amendment would open the door to the constant excuse before the magistrates, "I cannot find another cottage, or another house," or whatever it might be; and the magistrate would find it extremely difficult to prove that that statement was not true. He therefore could not support the Amendment. But why could not the Govern-

ment be content with the ordinary process of ejectment, facilitated, if necessary, by some more rapid proceedings, and omit from the Bill the fine altogether? Why should they make a man who declined to go out of a house, of which, after all, he was the rightful tenant, when ordered to do so by the local authority, a criminal with the probability that if he was ordered to pay a fine of that description he would be unable to do so and would be sent to prison? He would ask the noble Earl who led the House to take a merciful view and omit the fine altogether, facilitating ejectment if necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00679"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am bound to say I am impressed by what fell from my noble friend behind me, and also by what the noble Viscount opposite has said. No doubt there are other ways by which the result we desire can be obtained than by the imposition of this particular fine, and if noble Lords will allow me I will consult the authorities at the Local Government Board on the subject and see if some other form of penalty cannot be devised, and we might deal with the matter on a future occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00680"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he was much obliged to the noble Earl for that intimation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00681"><member>LORD CLINTON,</member> in withdrawing his Amendment, said that if nothing came of the noble Earl's suggestion, he reserved to himself the right to put down another Amendment after the same form, because he was confident that something ought to be done.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00683"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> moved an Amendment to provide that the expenses of the tenant in removing should not be paid if the uninhabitable condition of the house was due to his wilful act or default. He said it was notoriously the case that in the great majority of urban slum dwellings the unhealthy surroundings were due to the neglect of the tenants themselves. In some cases, of course, they had been distinctly traced to the fault of the owner, but in most cases they really were the fault of the tenant. Such tenants were perfectly reckless in their care of their dwellings, and very often treated them not only in a careless but in a malicious
<col>182</col>
way, and why should the community be saddled with the burden of giving compensation to such people? He also thought it worth mentioning that his Amendment was on all fours with an Amendment he had had the honour of moving the evening before, and which was carried without division. That Amendment was to the effect-that the landlord should not be held liable to remedy any defect caused by the act or default of the tenant or occupier, and although his present Amendment was not precisely in the same words it was practically on all fours with it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00687">Consequential Amendments agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00688"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to delete from paragraph (<i>c</i>) of subsection (8) the words "in every part thereof." He intimated that he did not propose to press this Amendment. His only reason for placing it on the Paper was that he thought there certainly might be many basement rooms which were seven feet in height through most of their area but which had a staircase or something of that kind, so that part of the area of the room would be less than seven feet. He did not, however, think it a very important point, and he did not desire to press it. But he wished to ask the consideration of the Government to the remaining proposals of the subsection. As he observed the other day, they were never considered by the House of Commons at all. They were not inserted in the Bill by the Standing Committee last year, and they were not discussed this year. If noble Lords would be good enough to look at paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of subsection (8) they would see
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0098"/>
<col>183</col>
that they required a basement room to be sufficiently protected against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation, and to be sufficiently ventilated, and in every part at least seven feet in height if it was to be used after the first day of July next year as a sleeping place by any person. Those were perfectly proper provisions, and he believed with reasonable regulations they might be carried into effect. But then the clause went on to require certain very minute particulars with regard to the construction of such rooms. They must be one foot at least in height above the level of the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room; and a room was to be considered injurious to health if it had not one or more windows opening directly into the external air, with a total area clear of the sash frames equal to at least one-tenth of the floor area of the room, and so constructed that one half at least of each window of the room could be opened, the opening in each case extending to the top of the window; or was not provided along the entire frontage thereof with an open area properly paved, at least four feet wide in every part thereof. Those were minute and particular regulations which he submitted ought not to form part of any Act of Parliament, but in so far as necessary ought to be enacted from time to time by by-laws to be framed by the local authority and to be approved by the Local Government Board. How could those provisions possibly be applied to many houses in London? He could instance a very well-known house which he had long dwelt in himself where the area was certainly not four feet wide in front of the basement windows; and if their Lordships chose to go into many parts of the older districts of London they would find, even in good and substantial houses, areas far more limited than was permitted by the clause. It must be remembered that the area space of a house was not a thing that could be altered at will by the owner, except by pulling down the house and rebuilding it. It would be impossible to meet such a requirement in many parts of London, except of course with very great inconvenience to the occupiers of the houses themselves. He believed that this was mainly a London question, because he was told by a very old member of the House of Commons, who was very well acquainted with the North of England, that this clause would be practically inoperative in the North of England because such rooms as it applied to did not exist there, and he sup-
<col>184</col>
posed also they would not exist in a rural district. But surely Parliament must consider what was possible to be done with a minimum of inconvenience to the persons concerned, and what he would suggest was that in accordance with an Amendment placed on the Paper by his noble friend the Earl of Camperdown the words in paragraphs (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), and (<i>f</i>), should be omitted and these words inserted, "It shall be the duty of the local authority to define from time to time by by-laws, to be approved by the Local Government Board, the requirements necessary for sufficient ventilation or sufficient protection against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation." That would enable such regulations to be made from time to time by the local authorities as would meet the circumstances of the case in every part of the Kingdom, and the Local Government Board would have control over those regulations as to what was possible to be carried out. He ventured to suggest to their Lordships that that was a much more workmanlike way of dealing with the matter.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00691"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said he would like to enforce what Viscount St. Aldwyn had said, by pointing out that in the Bill there was nothing to give any elasticity at all. These questions constantly came before him on appeal with regard to by-laws, and he constantly found that local authorities altered their by-laws so as to make them applicable to the particular district, and to the particular necessities of that district. It was just the case in which he had found from experience that the control of the Local Government Board was most useful, because when they had been obliged to hold that a by-law was either too stringent or not stringent enough the Local Govern

ment Board had always forced the local authority to frame something more in harmony with the real requirements of the case.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00692"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> agreed that the statement of the right rev. Prelate was accurate, and that the subsection did follow the Public Health Act of 1875, and also the Public Health Act of 1891. There were other paragraphs&#x2014;(<i>d</i>), for instance&#x2014;which were based on the last stringent requirements of the Public Health (London) Act. Section 72 of the Public Health Act, 1875, covered the further requirement of the subsection before them, so that it was not introducing in any way new principles entirely foreign to the legislation of this country. His Majesty's Government had had an opportunity of anticipating the suggestion of the noble Viscount opposite, and they had been able to confer upon the general subject of Amendments to the section as they appeared on the Paper. Of course, the Amendment which the noble Viscount had just suggested was one which did not come before the conference, but he hoped the suggestion he was going to make would really meet the case, and would be generally approved of by their Lordships. What they proposed to do was to ask the noble Viscount with regard to his particular Amendment to accept these words, that instead of "in every part thereof," there should be substituted the words "on an average." Then, with regard to the other Amendments, His Majesty's Government were prepared to accept the Amendment of the noble Viscount in page 10, line 32, to leave out from "air" to "and" in line 34, which would safeguard Downing-street for example, where the area was only three feet three inches wide. The further Amendment which they were prepared to accept was the one to leave out in page 10, at lines 39 and 40, "at least four feet wide in every part thereof," an Amendment also standing in the name of the noble Viscount. It was the hope of His Majesty's Government that those Amendments would really meet the case, and he ventured to say they went some way towards meeting the noble Lords opposite, and he hoped their Lordships would accept them and allow the rest of the subsection to stand.</p>

It enabled the law not only to be relaxed, but also to be tightened, and as they progressed in sanitary science it was very desirable that there should be some power in local authorities to deal with improved conditions in matters of the kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00694"><member>LORD STANMORE</member> said that although he quite agreed with the noble Viscount in thinking that the Amendment of the Earl of Camperdown would meet most of the case, yet that Amendment only proposed to come in after the clause which the noble Viscount, Lord St Aldwyn, proposed to leave out and which he thought it very desirable should be left out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00695"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that perhaps he had not made himself quite clear.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00707"><member>LORD NEWTON</member> moved to insert words making a closing order by a local authority under a Local Act a compliance with the requirements of the clause. He said this was one of the Amendments which were intended to be moved in another place but that did not happen for reasons upon which he would not enlarge. It was a matter to which some importance was attached, and the object was to allow those municipalities which already possessed certain powers to continue to exercise those powers with regard to housing and sanitary improvements instead of having recourse to the provisions of the section. Although the Amendment was, he believed, supported generally by the Association of Municipal Corporations, he desired more particularly to draw attention to the case of Manchester. Manchester obtained a Waterworks and Improvement Act as far back as 1867, and since the year 1885, when the committee was formed for the purpose, great improvements had been carried out in that city, as would be judged from the fact that since the year of which he was speaking no fewer than
<col>188</col>
16,000 houses were condemned and 6,000 houses had disappeared altogether. The procedure of their Local Act was an extremely simple one, but he did not wish to enlarge upon it. Great improvements had been carried out in the city, the death-rate had been largely reduced, and there had been absolutely no friction in connection with it. The practice of the Corporation had been to deal with each case separately with the owner or the agent, as the case might be, and the result had been that although there was an appeal to Quarter Sessions there had been absolutely no litigation in connection with the Act. In the course of the discussion yesterday the opinion was expressed on both sides of the House that a certain amount of latitude ought to be allowed to these great Corporations, and he rather thought that the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, spoke of it as almost an insult to suggest that the Local Government Board should dictate, for instance, to the London County Council. That appeared to be the general opinion of the Committee. If these great municipalities had been negligent or apathetic in their conduct of municipal affairs there would be an excellent <i>prima facie</i> reason for altering the present course of procedure, but he did not gather that any such charge was made by anybody in their Lordships' House. In those municipalities every shade of political opinion was represented, and he believed, at all events so far as regarded the City of Manchester, that everybody was unanimous in desiring that the present arrangement should continue. The President of the Local Government Board was a fair-minded man, and he was quite sure he did not wish, to quote an expression made use of by the noble Earl opposite yesterday, to usurp the functions of those great municipalities, or to dictate a particular course of action to them. That being so, he ventured to hope that the noble Earl responsible for the Bill would favourably consider his Amendment.</p>

was no idea in anybody's mind of dictating to a municipality, important or otherwise, in the way suggested by the noble Lord.

If they interposed between the Bill and the municipalities and gave them the option of going under their Local Acts the procedure became a great deal more involved and complicated, and he really thought it would be much more to the convenience of those who dealt with such matters throughout the country to know that under the clause the procedure in every case would be exactly the same. It was a matter of so much convenience that he hoped the noble Lord would agree to the Bill standing as it was.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00714"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH,</member> in moving the insertion of the new subsection set out in his Amendment, said that the matter was one of some importance, although he did not know what view their Lordships might take of it. His Amendment applied to the regulations laid down in Clause 17&#x2014;that was to say, the regulations with regard to inspecting houses, keeping certain records of them, and so forth. At present it was not known what the regulations as drawn up by the Local Government Board were likely to be, and unless care was taken all the objectionable features of the original Clause 30 might be reproduced. It was, therefore, thought necessary that Parliament should have an opportunity of seeing, and, if necessary, criticising all regulations made under the powers proposed to be given, and if his Amendment was carried that object would be attained.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00716"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought their Lordships would see in a moment that the Amendment hardly applied to what might occur under Clause 30. It would probably be more convenient to discuss a matter of that kind when they came to Clause 30. The Amendment before them simply said "A draft of every regulation made by the Board under this section," so that it only applied to what was in the section. He was afraid he must admit that he at first thought this was consequential upon the Amendment which the noble Lord had moved in subsection (1) of the clause. He ventured to hope that as their Lordships were content to reject that Amendment they would also reject the one now before them.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00727"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> moved to leave out subsection (<i>f</i>) and said this was one of the most striking provisions in this very remarkable Act. It enacted that an improvement scheme might provide for giving to the local authority any powers which might be necessary to enable them properly to carry out the scheme, and for dispensing so far as necessary with any obligation of the local authority or any other person to comply with any Local Act, Provisional Order, or Order. He would have thought it an elementary proposition that no Act could be contravened or repealed except by another Act. Parliament alone, surely, ought to have the right of appealing from its own Acts and Orders, and he did not know what safeguard any subject of His Majesty had if that was not the law of the land. They had always thought that as long as they understood the law of the land&#x2014;which, by-the-way, very few of them did&#x2014;they were protected by it. But under this subsection they would not only have to study the Statutes generally, but in addition have to find out whether&#x2014;he did not quite know by whom, but he supposed the Local Government Board&#x2014;permission had been given to the local authority to do something which was contrary to an Act of Parliament. He was not prepared to move any Amendment except that of deleting the whole paragraph, and he did not think the Bill would be very much the worse for that. If some modification of the law was required in this direction it should be accomplished by other means, and a provision should be made for Parliament repealing any Act.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00729"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that paragraph (<i>f</i>) was really inserted with a view of meeting what had been found in practice to be a considerable difficulty, and a difficulty over which there need not be controversy between noble Lords opposite and themselves. It was a mere matter of technical difficulty. The areas dealt with under the improvement scheme to which
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0103"/>
<col>193</col>
the clause referred were generally in the centre of towns, and many of the provisions of the last Act were intended to deal with the question of building on the outskirts; and therefore it was found impossible to clear an insanitary area in the best way and yet conform with by-laws and Acts as to the laying out of new streets. The case he had in mind was a case in Bradford, where it was found impossible to erect some tenement houses for the working-class, and it was necessary to procure a Provisional Order to amend the Local Act and remove the difficulty. No one had any objection, but having to get the Provisional Order meant considerable delay. He did not think that any one in that case would be in any way injured by the procedure proposed in this subsection. A small provision in a local Act might have the effect of hindering a very important improvement scheme, and that was the reason His Majesty's Government thought the provision in paragraph (<i>f</i>) might be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00730"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> did not entirely follow the argument of the noble Earl. He could understand that there might be some minor details in which local Provisional Orders and Acts would conflict with a scheme which it was very desirable in the interests of everybody should be carried out; but the subsection to which the noble Duke had taken exception gave the local authority very much wider powers. If it were necessary, as it might be necessary, no doubt, to alter provisions contained in a Local Act or Provisional Order, Parliament ought to be aware of what was being done; and any improvement scheme, so far as it made an alteration in the existing law, should be laid before Parliament, with power to Parliament to object to or alter it if they thought it necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00731"><member>LORD BELPER</member> explained that Section 6 of the Act of 1890 provided that the improvement scheme of a local authority should be accompanied by maps, particulars and estimates, and&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) may exclude any part of the area in respect of which an official representation is made, or include any neighbouring lands, if the local authority are of opinion that such exclusion is expedient or inclusion is necessary for making their scheme efficient; and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) may provide for widening any existing approaches to the unhealthy area or otherwise for opening out the same for the purposes of ventilation or health; and</li>
<col>194</col>
<li>(<i>c</i>) shall provide such dwelling accommodation, if any, for the working classes displaced by the scheme as is required to comply with this Act; and</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) shall provide for proper sanitary arrangements.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00732">This clause proposed to add the two new paragraphs (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) which appeared in the clause. The last subsection was of the widest description possible, and the question was who was to decide as to what it would be necessary to do under the clause. That might be decided apparently by the Local Government Board, and they might do anything they liked under this subsection. If that were to be the position it was no use Parliament legislating, because any regulation or by-law made under an Act of Parliament could be overridden, and there would be no check of any sort or kind. The noble Earl said it was found in experience there were very difficult cases which they could not meet without making some provision which was not foreseen when the Act was passed. No exception would be taken if the noble Earl brought forward a further clause which provided that so long as no one objected they should have the power. But it was inconceivable that His Majesty's Government should bring forward a clause of this kind. There were ways of guarding themselves against this enormous power sought by the Local Government Board, and he suggested that words should be inserted providing for the exercise of the discretion of Parliament.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00735"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked, with regard to the further words in paragraph (<i>f</i>), "any by-law, regulation, or other provision under whatever authority made," whether, supposing there was a port in a town, the Local Government Board would be empowered to interfere with the port authority.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00742"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> moved to omit Clause 24, which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"24.&#x2014;(1) Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) of section five of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903 (which limit the cases under which an order confirming an improvement scheme takes effect without confirmation by Parliament), shall cease to have effect.</quote>
<quote>(2) An order of the Local Government Board sanctioning a reconstruction scheme, and authorising the compulsory purchase of land for the purpose shall, notwithstanding anything in section thirty-nine of the principal Act, take effect without confirmation."</quote>
He said that of all the unintelligible clauses that appeared in the Bill this was the most unintelligible; in fact, he never looked at the Bill without a feeling of gratitude to the Lord Chancellor, because if it had not been for a Paper which the Lord Chancellor was so good as to have printed for their Lordships' use, it would have been absolutely impossible to understand not only this clause but a great many other clauses in the Bill. The word "limit," which appeared in subsection (1) of Clause 24, was absolutely incorrect, because, according to the explanatory paper provided by the Lord Chancellor, subsection (2) of Section 5, of the Act of 1903 provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"(2) The order of a confirming authority under subsection four of section eight of the principal Act, shall notwithstanding anything in that section take effect without confirmation by Parliament:&#x2014;</quote>
<col>196</col>
Then followed the words&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) if land is not proposed to be taken compulsorily; or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) if, although land is proposed to be taken compulsorily, the confirming authority before making the order are satisfied that notice of the draft order has been served as required as respects a Provisional Order by subsection five of the said section eight, and also that the draft order has been published in the <i>London Gazette,</i> and that a petition against the draft order has not been presented to the confirming authority by any owner of land proposed to be taken compulsorily within two months after the date of the publication and the service of notice, or, having been so presented has been withdrawn.</li>
</ol>
These paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) it was proposed by Clause 24 of this Bill to omit. He was not saying that that was a subsection that limited cases in which land might be taken, but it stated the cases in which land might be taken without coming to Parliament; and the word "limit" must have been inserted in Clause 24 by the Local Government Board or His Majesty's Government for the purpose of putting in the thin end of the wedge. The effect of what they did was to omit paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), and leave the beginning of the clause as it stood, containing the words "take effect without confirmation by Parliament"; so that by the result of that operation the clause was made to mean exactly the reverse of what it appeared to mean at the present time. Under these circumstances it was clear that by this device they were entirely reversing the present law. If it was necessary to reverse the law what could be the reason for doing it in that complicated and almost unintelligible way? The process in subsection (2) of the clause he proposed to delete was the same in slightly different words. Section 39 of the Act of 1890 covered a page and a half of the paper, and quite half was by this Bill struck out. It ran, "Where an order for the demolition of a building has been made in pursuance of this part of this Act," and then "Where it appears to the local authority that the closeness, narrowness, and bad arrangement or bad condition of any buildings, or the want of light, air, ventilation, or proper conveniences, or any other sanitary defect in any buildings is dangerous or prejudicial to health. &#x2026;. the local authority shall pass a resolution to the above effect and direct a scheme to be prepared for the improvement of the said area." Then the local authority "shall petition
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0105"/>
<col>197</col>
the Local Government Board for an order sanctioning the scheme." Then came the operative part. Upon such order being made the local authority "may purchase by agreement the area comprised in the scheme," and so on. So far as it provided for the taking of land otherwise than by agreement the order was to be provisional unless confirmed by Act of Parliament. By the striking out of all this part about its being provisional until it was confirmed by Act of Parliament, the result was that in those cases all power was removed from Parliament, even though there was an objection raised. A more complicated way of doing what, after all, was not a very intricate thing he had never heard of, and he could assure their Lordships that if they tried to study it, as he had, they would find it very difficult.</p>

<quote>(2) So much of subsection (3) of section twelve of the principal Act (which relates to the execution of improvement schemes) as restricts the powers of the local authority to execute an improvement scheme shall cease to have effect."</quote>
He said he had given notice of the rejection of this clause because it seemed to him to indicate a change of policy which required some explanation from His Majesty's Government. The clause effected a reversal of the former policy of carrying out schemes by local authorities themselves.
<col>198</col>
The clause practically took the place of Clause 12, subsection (3), of the Act of 1890, which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"The local authority may also engage with any body of trustees, society, or person, to carry the whole or any part of such scheme into effect upon such terms as the local authority may think expedient."</quote>
But then it went on, and this was really the important enacting part of the clause&#x2014;
<quote>"The local authority shall not themselves, without the express approval of the confirming authority, undertake the rebuilding of the houses or the execution of any part of the scheme, except that they may take down any or all of the buildings upon the area, and clear the whole or any part thereof, and may lay out, form, pave, sewer, and complete all such streets upon the laud purchased by them as they may think fit, and all streets so laid out and completed shall thenceforth be public streets."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00748">It was perfectly clear what the law was at present. The local authorities were not themselves enabled to do any of the work with regard to these schemes themselves, unless they were specially authorised by the confirming authority. The only thing they could do was the outside work of clearing away and arranging sewers and streets, as seemed desirable. The present clause was not a clause which modified that, but it started by putting in the forefront the, absolute authority of the local authority itself to execute any improvement scheme. As he had understood the policy of the Local Government Board, it was not to encourage especially small local authorities to carry out these schemes themselves, because in many cases they had not the staff or the knowledge to carry them out in an effective manner, and it was very likely to give rise to speculation and jobbery. Unfortunately throughout the whole of that Act large bodies such as the London County Council and the councils of the larger boroughs were treated in exactly the same way as rural and urban district councils, who were in many cases of small and unimportant character. He knew district councils in the Midland counties of England which were not bodies to whom they would be inclined to give large power with a view to building or carrying out these schemes. It was rather extraordinary that this clause proposed to sweep away all safeguards drawn in the former Act and made the local authority the absolute authority to carry out the scheme. He could not conceive a clause to be much worse drawn than this was.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0106"/>
<col>199</col>
It started by saying, "It shall be the duty of the local authority themselves to execute any improvement scheme under Part I." Then it went on to say, "except so far as provision to the contrary is made in the confirming order, and except so far as they exercise any of the powers given to them in pursuance of the Housing Act for enabling other persons to execute the scheme." Then the latter part of the clause practically did away with the veto upon their carrying out the scheme themselves which was in the former Act. His object in moving to omit the clause was to get an explanation of how the clause was drawn and of the extraordinary change of front to which he had called attention.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00750"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> quite admitted that on the face of it the clause made a very real and serious difference between what had been put in the previous Act and what was in the present Bill, and was the present policy of His Majesty's Government. But the facts were different from what appeared on the surface. The Housing Act of 1890 by Section 12 enacted that local authorities should not themselves "without the express approval of the confirming authority undertake," but it was the practice of the Local Government Board to give this approval. This clause therefore merely brought the previous law into conformity with what was the modern practice of the Local Government Board. The clause was not a very important one, and he thought the practice would not be altered if the clause was left out, but it was better that there should be a clause representing more exactly what was the present practice of the confirming authority, and it was for that object it was inserted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00751"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said there was very great difference between enabling the Local Government Board to dispense with an obligation and laying the obligation on a new body. The noble Lord had spoken on behalf of the smaller municipalities, but there ran through the whole of the Bill what appeared to be an attempt on the part of the Local Government Board to enforce matters which the ratepayers might determine to dispense with. In the case of small municipalities it would be impossible to have an organisation to carry out these provisions themselves, though they could
<col>200</col>
do it through a contractor. The London County Council and other municipalities had dispensed with the system of having a Works Department. He did not suggest jobbery or any attempt to use the Works Committee for work that was not desirable, but if a municipal authority engaged workmen it was not on a par with an ordinary contractor. An ordinary contractor discharged workmen when he did not want them; a municipality was told they should set an example and keep them on. In the case of the London County Council they have had a staff which could have done nearly five times the work they had had to do in the course of the last two or three years. It was highly undesirable to seek by Act of Parliament to impose on municipalities the very system which, after long trial, had been discarded because it was used, or was capable of being used, very largely for party purposes at the polls.</p>

That is to say, if they cannot find anybody else to do it they ought, having instituted this important scheme, to do it themselves. It seems to me a most reasonable thing, if an improvement scheme is necessary and the local authority cannot find other people to do the work, that they should do it themselves. Otherwise it means there must be
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0107"/>
<col>201</col>
no improvement scheme. I confess it does not seem to me a heavy burden to place upon the local authority to find somebody to carry out these works which they have decided, after consideration of all the circumstances, and after representation has been made to them by a medical officer of health that a certain area is insanitary, to be necessary. How it can be said that this places any new burden on the local authority I do not see. All that this does is simply to stereotype what is the invariable practice when a local authority goes with a scheme to the Local Government Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00757"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said the great objection to the clause seemed to be that it encouraged what was commonly known as municipal trading, whether that trading took the form of building or not. This question had been thoroughly debated by the great local authorities, especially by the County Council of London, where the practice had been in a great measure adopted. A great objection to municipal trading was that it interfered with the small trader, and put him to a great disadvantage. But the most serious objection was that it did not act in the interest of the ratepayers, because works that were carried on by local authorities were not conducted with that degree of economy that would be exercised if they were carried out privately. Parliament ought to consider the interests of the ratepayers. They really had not very much control over their own affairs, and he thought a clause like this placed them in a position of still greater disadvantage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00758"><member>LORD BELPER</member> did not know what the usual practice of the Local Government Board was, more than had been described by the noble Earl on the Front Bench. But he ventured to say that the clause laid it clown in the forefront that it was the duty of the local authority to carry out the work themselves. It did not say "If they cannot find anybody else to do it." It simply said "Except so far as provision to the contrary is made in the confirming order."</p>

<col>202</col>
seemed to him a very extraordinary way of drafting a clause if they did not wish to change the policy of the Department. Why should they put in the forefront that it was the duty of the local authority to carry out the work themselves? It would have been very easy to say that the work should be carried out by themselves whenever the Local Government Board approved. That was not the phraseology of the Bill. Just as the noble Viscount on the Front Opposition Bench wished it struck out, speaking for the major authorities, he, speaking for the minor authorities, thought it was an extremely undesirable clause, because it would encourage those authorities in jobbing and building speculations. He would certainly insist on the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00761"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> could not help thinking there was some confusion between two totally different things. First of all there was the duty of the local authority to execute the improvement scheme unless they exercised their powers for enabling other persons to execute the scheme. That did not mean anything more than that the other persons should have charge of the scheme, that they should manage it, instead of the local authority. That was one state of things. The noble Lord, Lord Zouche, he was afraid, thought that the words "the duty of the local authority to execute any improvement scheme" meant that they themselves should, through the means of a works department, engage in municipal trading. That seemed to him to be the noble Lord's fear, but that was not at all what was in the mind of His Majesty's Government in putting down the clause. The clause dealt really with the question of enabling the people to execute a scheme, not in the sense of themselves setting to work with bricks and mortar, but of a totally different body having charge of the scheme and carrying it out. There was nothing in the clause to prevent the local authority from employing a contractor, and if they employed a contractor they would still be carrying out the scheme themselves in the first part. He really thought that there was a confusion between the two things and that that had raised an opposition to the clause which it really did not deserve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00762"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> thought the confusion was in the mind of the noble Earl himself. What the clause said was, "so much of subsection (3) of

<col>203</col>
Section 12 of the principal Act (which relates to the execution of improvement schemes) as restricts the powers of the local authority to execute an improvement scheme shall cease to have effect." What were the powers to execute the scheme in the Act of 1890? Under that Act the local authority might engage and so forth, but the local authority should not themselves, without the express approval of the confirming authority, undertake the re-building of houses. That was exactly what Lord Zouche referred to. Therefore it was the provision regarding the re-building of houses which was repealed by this clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00763"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: To build houses you have to obtain the leave of the Local Government Board, and, as my noble friend pointed out earlier in this discussion, leave is always given. I think your Lordships will agree that to refuse leave to one of the large local authorities mentioned, who, of their own volition, desire to execute the work, would be a very marked interference with the local liberty on the part of the Local Government Board. I confess I am rather surprised at the little storm which this in our view an extremely harmless clause has caused. Its only intention was to bring the law into conformity with the general practice. There is nothing new in it whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00764"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> hoped the Government would be convinced by this discussion that they might carry legislation by reference a little too far. The noble Earl thought that although it seemed to have puzzled a good many noble Lords, many of whom were experts in reading Bills, yet it would be quite plain to the local authorities. He ventured to think that if the Bill went through with this clause in its present shape it would lead to any amount of misconception. The very first words of it were "It shall be the duty of the local authority to carry out certain schemes." Everybody would think it was their duty, and in the circumstances he thought the best thing their Lordships could do was to leave the clause out of the Bill. The noble Earl had said it made no difference and was only confirming the existing practice. If that were so, the noble Earl would not mind the clause being left out.</p>

This clause&#x2014;Clause 28&#x2014;provided that exceptions, restrictions end modifications should be put into an improvement scheme. That might mean that the local authority which made the scheme might put in restrictions, exceptions, and modifications, one of which might be that they should not give compensation to the owner as they would do under the Act of 1890.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00774"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member> moved to insert a new clause making it the duty of local authorities to keep a register of every dwelling-house to which the limitation as respected rateable value of Section 14 of the Act applied, containing particulars as to the situation, rated occupier, beneficial owner, name and address of freeholder, and rateable value. He said it would be readily understood that he did not very readily intervene in these discussions of experts, especially with a clause of a rather aggressive length. But he was led to put this clause down because he could not help thinking that here was a matter where they got rather past technicalities and to things upon which the ordinary citizen might form a judgment. The present Measure would, of course, in one way or another, constitute a very considerable epoch in the history of these matters. There had been a good deal of looking forward to it, and there would be a good deal of looking back upon it. He could not help believing that a very large number of people of all sorts, people with a practical intention, would see with great surprise and with no little regret that a measure of this kind went through without the introduction of what would really seem to be almost a first condition, and a quite harmless first condition, of the right treatment of these matters of ownership and of the discharge or the evasion of the responsibilities of ownership. He could hardly think that any one who was acquainted with the matter would say that it ought not to be a matter of simple open and public knowledge who owned different parts of the land of this or that rural district, or, what concerns many of, them more, this or that city. It seemed, to, him that it quite belonged to the character of our, whole system that there should be no secrecy, no mystery, and no evasion about a thing of that kind. And he was confirmed in this belief because a clause to this effect, since struck out, did pass through the Grand Committee, although circumstances, which it would perhaps be improper for him to dwell upon, prevented the matter from being afterwards discussed in another place. It did seem therefore, that this was a point which their Lordships' House ought hardly to pass by without notice. There appeared upon the Paper yesterday and the previous day an Amendment in the name of the right rev. Prelate, the Bishop of Birmingham, which had since disappeared
<col>206</col>
and was replaced by his clause. There was a difference between them in point of length, in point of complexity, and, if he might say so, in point of ambitiousness. In the Bishop of Birmingham's clause there was a provision for a general survey. There was no reference to any survey in his clause, but only to a register. There were also certain rather complicated provisions for giving effect to that proposal, and those had disappeared from his Amendment. On the other hand, it had been observed that there was already in existence in connection with valuation in many places a very great deal of the information which was desired; there were words in the clause which made all that existing material available, and it therefore would impose much less duty upon the local authority. He had a slight amount of real and first hand experience of these matters, and one of the things which had impressed itself most clearly upon his mind was the harm which was done by the existence of a number of small properties interlacing one another about which there was great obscurity as to the ownership. The owners were sometimes people at a distance with apparently no real interest. All that could be got was the name of the agent, and it was contrary to the public interest to have a large number of properties in a town of which they only knew that so-and-so was the agent. They knew the famous firm of Spender and Jorkins, and when the agent was Spender and when there was quite an unknown Jorkins behind there was the greatest difficulty in getting on with things that ought to be got on with. That last phrase was rather a vague one. It was intentionally vague. It was not always by any means with aggressive intentions towards the owner that this information was needed. The case was surely pretty common where the agent either because his one business was to get what he could out of the property or because he did not want to be bothered with the owner's interference, got the matter a great deal too much in his own hands. The owner, who might be a perfectly well-intentioned and upright man, did not know what was going on, did not know the condition the property had got into, and so forth. Therefore he had found that there would have been opportunities for quite healthy action on the part of citizens interested in such matters if they could have got to the owner, and could have pointed out to him what the con-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0110"/>
<col>207</col>
dition of his property was, and shown what effect it had upon a project to improve such and such a slum or small street. He ventured to say that the ancient system was open to very grave objections indeed. A good deal had been said about the danger of this Bill because it was always introducing the bureaucratic principle and placed too much power into the hands of local authorities. But certainly this Amendment would have no such effect. On the contrary the objection which he thought might be made from the Government Bench was that all the powers which it sought to complete were already in the hands of the authority, that the authority could obtain the information about the owner, and that the authority could keep in its pigeon holes a complete account. Then was it improper to say in this place, where they had necessarily to discuss the action of public bodies, that all authorities were not impeccable in these matters; that there were such things as apathetic authorities; and that there had been cases where the influence of a certain class of owner had been used, and used harmfully, behind the scenes upon the actual public authority. On the other hand, he ventured to say that this Amendment did not come under the objection which had been raised with regard to some proposals that it was hard upon owners, because here the kind of owners of whom they were thinking were not those whom any member of their Lordships' House would desire to shield, except in the case of those apathetic owners to whom he had credited good intentions but who exercised very little activity in regard to their property. They were thinking of the worst class, the more careless class, or the more objectionable class of owners. There was the absentee owner; there was the man who was irresponsible; there was the man who was too poor really to fulfil his obligations. It was only as to that kind of case that they would be acting. He believed he was speaking on behalf of a very large number of people when he said that this information ought to be known. Then it was argued that this, after all, constituted a hardship, because in this case or in that some charge grounded on public knowledge might, by some unscrupulous or malicious person, be brought against an owner at some critical moment. The owner might be a person who was standing in a political or municipal election, and it might be said of him that because of such and such houses of which it
<col>208</col>
was known he was the owner and where the occupiers were misconducting themselves this man was deserving of public discredit. He had set out the objection as it was one to which it was said that the House ought to attach a good deal of importance. It might be instanced that there were properties where the Ecclesiastical Commission were to blame through no fault of their own, the leaseholder here being apparently responsible for the very deplorable state of the properties; and he was told that there were cases in which. Bishops owned estates of the same kind. Although he could not act as judge of his right rev. Brethren, he thought that if such properties were in his possession, he would be quite prepared to stand the racket of the sort of risk involved in the Amendment. The distinction between owner and occupier would be sufficient to protect him from any but those occasional hardships which made bad law.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00777"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that this Amendment which came from the Episcopal Bench the Government could not see their way to accept. He was aware that, speaking generally, the Government had not been able to accept Amendments from that quarter of the House, and he confessed that after the Second Reading speech of the most rev. Primate they had looked for some assistance from those Benches. But, with the exception of the Bishop of Wakefield, the proposals submitted by the Episcopal Bench were so extreme that a moderate Government like the present were unable to follow them. It was evident from what had been said by the Duke of Northumberland that not only were the Government unable to accept this Amendment, but it was unlikely that it would find acceptance in any other quarter of the House. Under those circumstances he would deal with the case quite briefly, and he might point out that a great deal of the information desired by the right rev. Prelate was already obtainable from the Valuation Lists. The only information not given there was the name and address of the freeholder when the freeholder and owner were different persons. To obtain that information would probably involve some considerable expense, exhaustive investigations of title, and additional machinery. There was in Clause 38 power given to the Board to inquire into circumstances which appeared to demand special investigation; that would be a means of procuring all information which they thought ought to be demanded, and that should be sufficient. Then under Clause 17 as now passed, there were a considerable number of provisions
<col>210</col>
which were not within the cognisance of the members of the House of Commons when Clause 30 was there considered, and the President of the Local Government Board hoped by Clause 17 to get a good deal of the information desired by the right rev. Prelate. In those circumstances he feared there was no chance of the Amendment being accepted, and he was unable to take the responsibility of advising the Committee to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00778"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member> said the noble Earl had expressed a sense of disappointment at the manner in which the Bill had been received and that the Episcopal Bench had not helped the Government more in the matter. He was of opinion that the Bill was being carried through the House at a very reasonable rate and the main provisions which he had advocated in the former debate had been passed. Some of the Amendments which had been moved, although not openly welcomed by the Government, had been accepted without serious opposition. He entirely adhered to the satisfaction that he expressed in regard to the Bill on the Second Reading. He then was of opinion that the Bill was introduced with provisions of a satisfactory character and so far as he could see those substantial and beneficient provisions had not been seriously impaired by the present discussion. He confessed to a sense of disappointment in regard to the non-acceptance by the Government of the clause under discussion, especially after what had been stated on the previous night, when the Bishop of Hereford proposed an Amendment which the Government did not think it desirable to support. Speaking on behalf of the occupants of the Episcopal Benches and putting the case in the simplest form, he desired to make it impossible for any man in possession of vile, ill-used or ill-cared-for property to escape the fullest publicity and wholesome discipline which would follow the knowledge that he was the owner. He believed that to be a sound principle, and desired to emphasise the wish to see such knowledge available to everybody. That night for the first time the House had been given to understand that the Government took an opposite view, and proposed to shield from public knowledge those who might be the owners of public property of which they would be ashamed to confess themselves the owners, and to say that the agent
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0112"/>
<col>211</col>
might be the only person whose name could be ascertained by the public interested in the matter. If that was the position of the Government, it would be for the Government to defend it in the House and in the country, but he confessed to a genuine feeling of great disappointment that such a principle should be laid down. He would be exceedingly sorry if the clause could not be added to the Bill with of course any such verbal Amendment as the technical advisers of the Government deemed necessary. The knowledge that the principle asserted in this Amendment was repudiated by the Government caused him both surprise and disappointment.</p>

Primate. As regards this particular Amendment the most rev. Primate goes farther than the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, and says that his object is to pillory by publicity the person who is responsible for these unrepaired houses left in a deplorable condition. Now, my Lords, does the proposal really carry that into effect? What does the Amendment of the right rev. Prelate really do? It gives the situation and address of the house; it gives the rated occupier; the name and address of the beneficial owner, and the name and address of the freeholder.
<col>212</col>
Without knowing what are the terms of the contract existing between those parties, I defy any one to say who is the person morally responsible for the condition of any particular house. In one case it may be the freeholder; in another it may be the person who goes by the name of the owner; and again it may be the occupier. You place these people side by side; the public have no means of knowing who is the guilty party; and unless they are prepared to go into the most minute investigation as to title and other matters I do not see how you can hope to carry out what I admit is a most desirable result. We should all be glad to have the persons known as slum landlords brought into the light of day, but we must be careful when we are holding them up to public shame that they are the right people. I fail to see how the Amendment would ensure that. The power of obtaining information, except so far as the particular case where the freeholder and the owner are not one and the same is already given. The information can be obtained by access to the Valuation List, which is a very simple matter. Consequently I cannot agree with the right rev. Prelate that any real benefit would result from the adoption of this Amendment. I must respectfully protest against the imputation that we object to it because we are quite indifferent as to who are these people, and whether they, as owners of this inferior class of property, are subjected to the force of public opinion. That is not the case, but we do not think the Amendment would serve any public good, because we believe that the public authorities without exception throughout the country will carry out all the provisions of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

He was aware that it might be said that in so far as the Amendment dealt with a question of rating it might be to some extent outside the cognisance of that House, but he made no apology for bringing it forward, because the clause effected so great a change that it should not be allowed to pass into law without the full effect being realised. It provided that the expenses incurred by a rural district council after the passing of this Bill in the execution of Part III of the principal Act should be defrayed as general expenses of the council in the execution of the Public Health Acts; but Section 65 of the Act under which they were working provided that all expenses incurred by a local authority for the purposes of the Act should be defrayed in the case of a rural council authority as special expenses incurred in execution of the Public Health Acts. It would be seen, therefore, that expenses treated as special under the old Act would under this Bill be treated as general expenses. The Public Health Acts provided that when a special assessment was made certain persons and land should be assessed only to one-fourth of their rateable value, and if this Bill changed the rate from special to general they would be assessed at their full value. That was a very great and important change, and ought to be realised before this section was passed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00789"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said these questions of rating were not very easy to follow, but he hoped the House would not agree to the Amendment. Under the
<col>214</col>
present system the expenses incurred by any rural district council under Part III of the Bill, and levied on a special area, would be treated as special expenses unless the county council made them general, and this Bill proposed to make those expenses general unless the Local Government Board made some alteration in the matter. The general principle was one which, he thought, was accepted by Lord St. Aldwyn in regard to a somewhat similar matter. The opinion of the Government was that a matter of this kind did not affect a small special area only, but the whole of the area, and it was only fair that any expenses incurred should be borne by the area affected by the building scheme. Although it might be only a small parish or even a small part of a parish where the houses were erected, the scheme affected the larger area, and the Local Government Board thought it fair to ask them to bear the expenses. The Board, on the application of a rural district council, could make the cost chargeable on one or more parishes as special expenses, and would in that way relieve agricultural land to some extent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00790"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said the matter was a very important one in practice, because it really regulated the taxation of the district, and might impose upon the whole of the district taxation which really ought to be borne by a particular area. It might further alter the whole amendment and incidence of taxation in certain cases to which the law now applied. He would prefer the Government to take the matter the other way. There might be cases where the expenses of providing workmen's dwellings might be for the benefit of the whole district, but he thought the expenditure would be primarily for the benefit of a portion of the district, and perhaps of one parish. If the law allowed those expenses to be charged on a particular area and at the same time allowed the Local Government Board on the recommendation of a district council, to spread the expenditure over the whole area, it would be a better proposal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00791"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said another important change made the Local Government Board arbiter instead of the county council in deciding as to how the expenses should be charged. If ever there was a case in which local representation on the

county council was of value in deciding a point of this sort, this surely was the case. It was obvious that the Board could only obtain the necessary information from a rural district or by sending down an official to inquire into the matter. The change called for some explanation, and he could only attribute it to the extreme jealousy on the part of the Local Government Board of county councils. If that were the only explanation forthcoming the law ought to be allowed to remain as it was, and the county councils should be left as arbiters. The proposal certainly required some further explanation from the Government.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00805"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> moved to leave out the word "sixpence" and to insert "one shilling." He did not know whether the Government saw any objection to the Amendment. Under the Act of 1903 houses of less than &#x00A3;20 gross annual value were exempt from inhabited house duty, and last year it was represented to the Government that lodging houses might be placed in the same category. It was then agreed to do so in cases where not more than sixpence a night was charged for each person. There were now a number of model lodging houses in the metropolis where beds were obtainable at a charge of sevenpence and eightpence, and those houses were excluded from the benefits of the concession made by the Government. He therefore suggested that the limit should be raised to ninepence or a shilling. It was impossible for the Amendment to be moved this year on the Report stage in the House of Commons; otherwise it would not have been necessary for him to have placed this Amendment on the Paper.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00807"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> regretted that the Government were unable to accept the Amendment, the effect of which would be to throw a charge upon the taxpayer. The present law exempted from Inhabited House Duty all separate houses and cottages under &#x00A3;20 annual value, and in the opinion of the Local Government Board there was no reason why in the case of houses above that amount of annual value particular exemption should be allowed. It was the opinion of the Treasury that the charge of sixpence per night would cover the ordinary common lodging house, and therefore they objected very much to any increase of the amount.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00808"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> pointed out that sixpence did not effect the object which the Government had in view. It was unfortunate that they should put into an Act of Parliament an undertaking which was not carried out.</p>

He was of opinion that on a question of law, if not on a question of fact, it was extremely desirable there should be an appeal from the decision of the Local Government Board. It was obvious that before the Board gave a decision they would probably consult their own legal officers. Consequently those who disputed the action of the Board were afforded no satisfaction in the knowledge that their appeal would go before the same law officers. The noble Earl the Leader of the House had said on the Second Reading of the Bill that it was not correct to say that the appeal went to one of the parties to the dispute. The only reason for his using the term "one of the parties" was that if the Board gave a decision on a question of law which was disputed by the authority upon whom the order was made there were, at all events, two parties to the dispute. He admitted that the Local Government Board had no personal interest in the matter but only tried to do their duty fairly in the circumstances that had arisen. But having given their decision practically by stating their opinion upon that question of law, it did seem necessary for the point to be carried to an independent authority. He did not understand whether that point was covered by any previous Amendment, but he wished to safeguard himself against the insertion in the Bill of words giving the appeal again to the Local Government Board on a question of law.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00825"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> agreed that the Amendment was hardly necessary. As the Bill stood there was nothing but the opinion of the law officers of the Local Government Board to give any authority or decision upon a question of law, and as their opinion was not binding in any way it was obvious there was no real decision on a point of law which could be quoted. Now that the question of appeal came before a Judicial Court he saw no necessity for the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00826"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I hardly know whether it is necessary for the Government to interfere, because this matter has, to a great extent, been taken out of their hands.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00830"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> moved to insert a new clause after Clause 40. He said the title of the Bill was "A Bill to amend the Law relating to the Housing of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0117"/>
<col>221</col>
the Working-classes," and it seemed to him that there ought to be inserted in the Bill some clause showing who those persons were, and that the intention of the Bill was that the houses to be provided should be houses for the working-classes. For that purpose he moved to insert the new clause standing in his name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00831">Amendment moved:&#x2014;
<quote>"After Clause 40, to insert the following new clause:</quote>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00832"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that in the opinion of the Local Government Board this clause was not necessary for the purposes of the Bill, and they hoped their Lordships would not insist upon its being put in. In regard to the first subsection of the proposed clause, most people who had frequently to read Acts of Parliament generally suspected any clause in which the words "as far as possible" came in. They were exceedingly vague, and often went far to make the application of the clause very difficult indeed. He thought he might fairly remind the noble Earl that the local authority could only provide houses suitable for the working-classes and, therefore, it really did not seem to be necessary to indicate it more particularly in this clause. What the noble Earl desired to do was to see that this accommodation was occupied exclusively by persons of the working-classes. It placed a considerable duty upon the local authorities, and he was not quite sure that those authorities would always welcome that duty being placed upon them. Supposing a number of their houses were empty, which would be better&#x2014;that they should remain empty until some members of the working-classes came along to fill them, or that anybody who wished to live in those houses
<col>222</col>
should be allowed to do so? There were, he believed, dwellings of this kind no great distance from their Lordships' House which were occupied by people other than members of the working classes, and he did not know that anybody was the worse for that. Then the second subsection of the proposed new clause dealt with the list. He was not quite sure what the object of the noble Earl was in wishing that that list should be kept. It was quite obvious that the local authorities would be only too anxious that their dwellings should be occupied and they would naturally keep a list so that anybody who wished to become a <i>bona fide</i> occupier could see the list. From the point of view of the ratepayers, the more substantial the tenant the more secure the rates would be, and, therefore, the better pleased the ordinary ratepayer would be. He imagined that the object of the noble Earl was that anybody who wished to do so could satisfy himself of the class of people living in these houses. That did not seem to be a particularly desirable position, or one that, in the, opinion of the Government, was at all required by the local authorities, who very probably would dislike to keep the register.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00833"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> was very glad to hear that the Government were anxious on behalf of the ratepayers, but their acts hitherto in connection with this Bill did not seem to him to imply that this regard expressed in words had any practical effect. With regard to the object of this Amendment, this Bill was, of course, intended for the benefit of the working-classes and of the working-classes only, and surely it could not be right that the rates should be spent in providing houses which would be occupied by persons other than the working-classes. If the contrary were to be the case, then the ratepayer had indeed terribly sad days before him. The ratepayer had been chastised with whips so far, but under this Bill their Lordships might depend he would be chastised with scorpions. He would like to call attention to the extent to which the so-called intention, as stated in the title, was actually carried out in the Bill itself. The only reference on that point in the Bill was in Clause 14. The houses there mentioned were to be occupied by anybody, and there was no reference to the working-classes at all. Therefore, if the title of the Bill were to correspond with the contents, it ought
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0118"/>
<col>223</col>
not to be termed "A Bill to amend the law with relation to the housing of the working-classes," but it ought to be called "A Bill to amend the law with regard to the provision of houses of &#x00A3;40, &#x00A3;26 and &#x00A3;8," because there was no mention of the working-classes. In defence of the ratepayers it was most desirable that it should be stated in the Bill that it was intended for the housing of the working-classes and of the working-classes exclusively. With regard to the second subsection of the clause, if the noble Earl objected to it he did not mind leaving it out; but if they objected to every enactment which contained the words "as far as possible" they would object to one-third or one-fourth of all the enactments passed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00834"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> hoped the noble Earl would not press any part of his Amendment, because he thought such provision was already made in the Bill as amended by their Lordships. If the noble Earl would recollect what happened on Clause 10, he would remember that they then inserted a proviso of his (Viscount St. Aldwyn's) to the effect that before they made any order for the construction of houses under this Act, the Local Government Board should be satisfied that there was necessity for further accommodation for the housing of the working-classes. While he did not think for a moment that of its own free will any local authority would provide houses under this Bill for any but the working-classes, the question was what would happen under the order of the Local Government Board? The Local Government Board were bound to consider whether accommodation for the working-classes, and for them only, was required, and therefore he did not think there was any real danger of what the noble Earl feared.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00835"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I also hope the noble Earl will not press his Amendment, although not precisely for the reason just given by the noble Viscount. The fear, I suppose, of the noble Earl has been that houses that existed in a particular area might possibly be occupied by persons of such position and means that they could not be described as belonging to the working-classes, and that in spite of the fact that those houses existed the local authority might be tempted to go in for a fresh building scheme. I do not think any local authority is likely to undertake such
<col>224</col>
an enterprise as that. I differ from the noble Viscount in the opinion which he appears to hold that the Local Government Board are likely to force such proceedings upon any local authority, and where I differ fundamentally from the noble Earl who moved the new clause is in the desire which he has to define a member of the working-classes as a particular kind of manual worker. The working-classes are not so defined in the previous Act. That I particularly value because I am quite certain that there are other classes of persons who ought to be housed, and who deserved to be housed, quite as much as those whom the noble Earl desires to include.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00836"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> thought that, if the ratepayers were put to the expense of providing this kind of accommodation, some attempt should be made to see that that money was being used for the advantage of the particular people for whom it was originally voted and spent.

It was recognised in Section 28 of the Act of 1890, which enabled the Board to dispense with these notices in certain cases. The effect of the clause now being discussed was simply to extend that principle to cases of the same nature arising under Part II or Part III. In similar cases the existing provision had been useful and no objection had been raised to it. He asked the noble Lord to look at subsection (3), which required that care should be taken by the Board to prevent the interests of any person being prejudiced by the dispensation. Did not the noble Lord think that sufficient safeguard?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00853"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> said he had great respect for the present President of the Local Government Board, but many noble Lords felt that they did not want to put their property at the mercy of the Board.

But surely it would be much wiser in the interests of the Government themselves to reassure public opinion and make people feel quite confident that they would receive due notice of any contemplated action by the Department affecting their interests. It was not very much to ask that they should have notice that something was going to be done which might be of certain injury to their interests.

The arguments of the Local Government Board were stronger even in this case than they were in the last. The object of Clause 43 was to save unnecessary expense and to make publication more effectual. The present system was open to two important objections. In the first place, the publication <i>in extenso</i> of this class of schemes was very expensive, and the publication in the <i>London Gazette</i> as was the present method, was not a useful way of informing the locality, as the <i>London Gazette</i> was not read by many private individuals. Therefore, Clause 43 provided that the advertisement notices should merely give short particulars of the scheme, order, or draft, and should state where copies could be seen. In the second place, it said that instead of the advertisement being in the <i>London Gazette</i> it should be in two local newspapers circulating in the area affected, or should be made by notice given in such

other manner as the Local Government Board might determine. Generally speaking, the Board would not wish to alter that method of publication, but would wish publication in the two local newspapers.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00866"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> moved an Amendment providing that nothing in the section should prevent the erection or use of houses placed back-to-back if the medical officer of health certified that they were constructed and arranged so as to secure effective ventilation. He said the object of his Amendment was to obviate difficulties in Leeds. Leeds had a number of these back-to-back houses, and had been confirmed in the building of them by three successive Acts of Parliament&#x2014;in 1872, 1893, and 1905; and in the last year no objection was raised by the Local Government Board. This was a <i>volte face</i> in Parliament with regard to the question, and it was <i>volte face</i> taken without evidence. He need not go through the arguments in

<col>229</col>
favour of the Amendment, because they had been circulated to their Lordships in a Memorandum by the Corporation of Leeds. Leeds was one of the healthiest cities in the United Kingdom. It had risen lately in healthiness, and was now second only to the City of London. These back-to-back houses were extremely popular because they were cheap. He would like to say, with regard to this Amendment, that it did need some discussion in their Lordships' House because, though an Amendment was moved in another place to alter the clause, a vote was taken without any discussion at all. The President of the Local Government Board, in his speech on the Second Reading, devoted some time to arguments in favour of this clause. The right hon. gentleman quoted figures relating to the prevalence of consumption, but he (Lord Monk Bretton) could quote similar figures from the Corporation of Halifax which proved that phthisis was more prevalent in the through houses of the town than in the back-to-back houses. He would not recapitulate the arguments which were used by the right honourable gentleman, but he thought most of his arguments referred to back-to-back houses altogether&#x2014;that was to say, back-to-back houses since the year 1840; and the medical authorities which he quoted were also, so far as he was aware, speaking of back-to-back houses as a whole and not of modern back-to-back houses. The arguments for the Amendment were, first, that the frontage in these modern back-to-back houses was larger than the frontage in the through houses. Secondly, there could not possibly be overcrowding in the back-to-back houses because they could only hold one family. Whatever might be the opinion of the Local Government Board, experts differed with regard to this matter. Sir Henry Littlejohn, who had given evidence against back-to-back houses before the Local Government Board, had since declared&#x2014;
<quote>"I am bound to say that my opinion with regard to back-to-back houses has been completely changed since I saw Leeds."</quote>
Sir Henry Littlejohn gave a number of reasons why back-to-back houses were better for the purpose of isolating infectious disease, and said their ventilation was no worse than that in tenements. There was other evidence in support of the Amendment which he would not quote. He saw on the Benches opposite Lord Airedale, who
<col>230</col>
had presented to their Lordships' House a petition on behalf of the building societies of Leeds against this clause. He (Lord Monk Bretton) thought there were ample powers in the Bill for dealing with bad back-to-back houses, or preventing their erection in the future, and he could not see why the Government should insert this particular clause with regard to back-to-back houses. If they distrusted the medical officer of health of a great corporation, why did they introduce into this Bill a clause which provided that that medical officer should be independent of the corporation? The important point with regard to back-to-back houses was this. These houses could be erected more cheaply and therefore could be let more cheaply; that was the reason why they were popular with the working-classes. It was the case, as he submitted was proved with considerable effect by experts, that they were not less sanitary than either tenements or through houses. Therefore by this clause the Government were enacting a law that hereafter the working men of these towns should pay two shillings a week more rent for houses which would not be more sanitary than those in which they were now living.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00868"><member>LORD AIREDALE</member> said the powers which would be conferred under the Amendment were of very material importance to the City of Leeds, in which he had considerable interests, and he had presented to their Lordships the other day a petition in its favour from the Associated Building Societies of Leeds. These societies had an invested capital of nearly three millions. That money was formed of the savings of the artisans and middle class of Leeds, and was largely advanced upon working-class dwellings in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In the City of Leeds there were advances on what were called back-to-back houses of something like three-quarters of a million of money. Under the Bill as it was now submitted it was sought to withdraw from the City of Leeds the power to build back-to-back houses. He had had some experience in the provision of houses for the working-classes in Leeds. In the early seventies he was associated
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0122"/>
<col>231</col>
with gentlemen who sought to solve the question of providing for working men what were called through houses in contradistinction to back-to-back houses, the construction of which the Government were endeavouring under this Bill to discontinue. They built &#x00A3;20,000 worth of houses&#x2014;through houses&#x2014;for working men, which were sold individually to these men at a cost of something like &#x00A3;155. This was in the early seventies. Then arose a great disturbance in the cost of labour and building materials arising out of the Franco-German war. The result was that the houses which they had been building to sell to working men at the price of &#x00A3;155 rose in cost to something like &#x00A3;240, and he doubted if now they could build the same houses for less than &#x00A3;250. Their Lordships would see at once that that put a stop to the provision of through houses at a reasonable rent. The consequence was that the City of Leeds came to Parliament, and in the year 1893 this question was discussed before a Parliamentary Committee and a plan for back-to-back houses was approved by Parliament after full discussion. These back-to-back houses were built in blocks of eight, with a stipulated width of street and with a separation of fifteen feet from each block. That fifteen feet contained sanitary arrangements which caused the houses to be healthy and well ventilated, and with the provision of open streets no better house of a moderate cost could be provided for the working-classes. As advances of three-quarters of a million had been made on these back-to-back houses, there must be in existence houses of the value of one million sterling. If this Bill passed without amendment they would be obliged to discontinue the provision of these houses, and a very serious injury would be inflicted on the working-classes of Leeds. On the other hand, of through houses they had not hundreds, but thousands, at this moment unoccupied. If the Bill was passed in its present form the result would be that two families would go to live in one house. The provision offered by the Local Government Board was the provision of tenement houses. Tenement houses had been erected in Leeds and had proved most objectionable. There was the abominable common stair, and they were altogether unsuitable and were not accepted at all in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Back-to-back houses, however, were satisfactory to all. The statement he was
<col>232</col>
making was supported by the City Council of Leeds, and they asked Parliament to allow them to manage their own affairs. The party with which he had been so long associated were, he believed, distinguished for the advocacy of local management of local affairs; yet they were attempting to take this away from Leeds and to place in the hands of a Department in Whitehall the power of regulating the tenements of a great community with a population of something like half a million. He cordially supported the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00869"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member> said he had listened with great attention to the remarks of the mover of the Amendment and of the noble Lord opposite. He cordially agreed with those remarks. He had known the City of Leeds very intimately for more than forty years. There was no particular magic that he knew of with reference to the goodness or badness of back-to-back houses. The houses really relied on the sanitary arrangements of the immediate locality. If there was a block of six or eight back-to-back houses and there were large streets around those houses and other social amenities connected with them, they were quite in the front rank as regarded healthy residences. It did not follow that a back-to-back house as such should be absolutely condemned. Leeds had very many such houses, and Leeds was one of the six large cities in the United Kingdom, and was next to London in the healthiness of its population. The Corporation of Leeds wished to be permitted to continue to build back-to-back houses, and the large building societies of Yorkshire desired the continuance of such buildings. There was the safeguard of the medical officer's approval in regard to such houses, and he could not see for the life of him why in a Bill of this sort it should be held that back-to-back tenements, or flats, as they would be called in London, were salubrious, and that back-to-back houses were not salubrious. He would have thought that back-to-back houses were much more salubrious than back-to-back tenements. In all these circumstances he cordially supported the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00870"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member> said that, in common with the noble Lords who had spoken, he had some knowledge of Leeds. He believed there was no doubt that with the modern arrangements of ventilation back-to-back houses could be quite as
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0123"/>
<col>233</col>
well ventilated and quite as wholesome as other houses. There was no question at all as to what the feeling of the town of Leeds was in this matter, and he heartily supported the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00871"><member>LORD ALLERTON</member> said he knew a great deal about Leeds. Forty years ago he went on to the Corporation and therefore knew the work of that body and the care they took, and he thought it was rather a strong order after the Corporation of Leeds had obtained an Act of Parliament, after a searching investigation by a Committee, giving them the power to build these houses, that that power should be abrogated by a general Act of this kind. Leeds was very disturbed on this question, and he thought rightly so. It was a very large question, and he did not think that any justification could be found for taking away the power which Leeds possessed at the present time, unless it could be shown that these houses were not healthy. But the very opposite of that was the fact. The statistics showed that in the year 1893 Leeds stood fourth on the list as regarded death-rate; four years later it stood third; four years later still it stood second, and it had maintained that position since. Out of 17,000 houses built in Leeds between 1900 and 1909, nearly 10,000, roughly speaking, were hack-to-back houses. He had been inside hundreds of them, and he said unhesitatingly that there could be no justification for this clause on the ground of their being unhealthy or insanitary. In his opinion these houses, built as they were in Leeds with a paved street on both sides of them so that the streets could be washed and cleansed, were much more healthy to live in than the through houses which could be built for any such sum. Bet there was another point of view. By this clause the Government were doing the equivalent of reducing the wages of the working-class, because if they imposed upon them the additional cost which was represented by 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week, the difference between the rent of a through house and a back-to-back house, that was the equivalent of reducing wages, and that was of great consequence to Leeds. He did not think that any justification for this action could be shown. He thought this proposal had arisen entirely from a misapprehension of what these houses were. The attention of architects and of the Corporation and of the medical officer of health had for the last forty years, to his personal knowledge, been
<col>234</col>
directed to the great problem of how to provide a dwelling for a working man at a reasonable cost, and he believed they had found a solution of it in the houses that they provided. He hoped, therefore, their Lordships would support the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00872"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member> did not think he would be quite honest if, after what had fallen from, noble Lords who represented Leeds, he did not say that at the time when he knew Leeds best there was certainly a strong opinion amongst those who cared most for sanitary reform against back-to-back houses. There was no doubt a great deal of controversy on the matter; but as far as he could judge the opinion of those who cared most about the public health, it was not the prevailing opinion that back-to-back houses were the best. Opinion was certainly very much divided. Noble Lords who had spoken knew a great deal better than he did what the present opinion of Leeds was, but ho thought it well that he should state that Leeds used to be sharply divided on this point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00873"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said it was very curious that they should have had five noble Lords one after the other speaking in favour of back-to-back houses and every one of them from Leeds. He was much obliged to the right rev. Prelate, who was himself for some time Vicar of Leeds and had an intimate knowledge of the question, for the contradiction he had made, and which went some way, at any rate, towards putting a different point of view before their Lordships from that which had been presented by the other speakers. It was very curious that they should not have had from any other districts testimony in favour of back-to-back houses. He would have thought that it was notorious that if there was one thing upon which housing reformers were agreed up and down the country, it was that back-to-back houses were very undesirable. If any noble Lord took up the current literature published by those interested in housing reform, they would find that back-to-back houses were universally condemned; and there was this further to be said that, with the exception of Leeds, in almost every town the erection of houses of this kind was forbidden. He quite agreed that if their Lordships were disposed to allow back-to-back houses to be erected, probably the form adopted in Leeds was the best to be found; but he did not think that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0124"/>
<col>235</col>
that, after all, was a very great admission to make. When all was said and done, this clause only applied to future houses. It would in no way affect the security of the Leeds building societies or the houses which they possessed. It merely provided that in future houses of this kind were not to be erected except under certain conditions. The clause contained a proviso which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this section shall prevent the erection or use of a house containing several tenements in which the tenements are placed back to back, if the medical officer of health for the district certifies that the several tenements are so constructed and arranged as to secure effective ventilation of all habitable rooms in every tenement."</quote>
That did allow tenements of this kind to be erected if the medical officer of health was of opinion that that might safely be done. That seemed to him to be a provision which, taken by itself, really might be thought to qualify sufficiently the condemnation of back-to-back houses. He did not know that they need argue with the noble Lord behind him on the question of how far it was right to interfere with the discretion of localities in this matter, but he did not think there had ever been any objection to interfering with a locality when in the opinion of Parliament it was thought that that locality was taking any steps which might endanger the health of those who lived in that neighbourhood. In those circumstances he hoped the Committee would allow the clause to remain as it stood.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00874"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member> said that since the right rev. Prelate was in Leeds a different state of things had obtained in regard to building back-to-back houses. These houses in Leeds were built in blocks of six and eight at a time, and were surrounded by large streets with plenty of air and plenty of space. It seemed to him that by this Bill it would not be lawful to continue to build back-to-back houses, though it would be lawful to continue to build back-to-back tenements. He could not see why if tenement houses were permitted to be built, houses should not be allowed to be built back to back.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00875"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I have no pretence whatever to speak as an expert upon this subject, but there is one point which must, I think, be obvious to us all. The great crux of this housing question is the difficulty of obtaining cheap
<col>236</col>
houses. It seems to me that we should hesitate to put a stop to any kind of house building which is especially calculated to solve that most difficult problem. It is claimed for these back-to-back houses that they can be built not only more cheaply, but much more cheaply, than houses built upon a different system. Then I find that in the Bill as it stands His Majesty's Government are quite ready to tolerate back-to-back tenements although they will not tolerate back-to-back houses, and it has not yet, I think, been quite sufficiently explained to us why that which is tolerable in the case of tenements is intolerable in the case of houses. This clause seems to be sufficiently safeguarded by the stipulation that the approval of the medical officer is to be required before buildings of this kind can be erected. The noble Earl who has charge of the Bill spoke rather facetiously of the amount of support which the Amendment had received from noble Lords connected with the City of Leeds, but I think it is very remarkable that this great weight of testimony from Leeds should have come before us this evening; and it is the fact, is it not, that Leeds has been building these houses with the sanction of Parliament. I think it was said by one of the speakers that no fewer than 10,000 houses of this description were at this moment in existence, and those who are familiar with the place and who are best able to speak give these houses a good character. I must say that in those circumstances it does seem to be a very strong order to vote against the Amendment of my noble friend, and if he goes to a Division I shall support him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00876"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I confess that in my opinion this is a very difficult matter to decide. I am naturally biassed in favour of Leeds, which I know very well, and it is undoubtedly true that the death-rate of Leeds is exceedingly low, partly, I have no doubt, owing to the admirable habits of the people who inhabit the city, but so far that fact is a distinct testimony, I frankly admit, to the manner in which the citizens of Leeds are housed. On the other hand, you have the singular fact that it is Leeds, and Leeds alone, that puts in a plea for this particular kind of building. There are noble Lords here who know all about Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and London. Nobody in any one of those great cities asks for back-to-back houses, and I think the Committee must admit in all fairness that that does create a diffi-

<col>237</col>
cult and serious situation. As my noble friend behind me said, it is one of the first truisms of all housing reformers that the ordinary back-to-back house as largely built in many parts of England in past years is absolutely the worst kind of house that can be erected. That is the first commonplace of everybody who has written or spoken on the subject of housing reform. Against that we have this testimony of Leeds to the merits of this singular kind of back-to-back houses that obtain there. That, as I say, places us in a position of peculiar difficulty, for this reason. If Leeds stood alone, I should like, if it were possible&#x2014;I am speaking only for myself&#x2014;to add a schedule to the Bill excluding Leeds from the operation of this clause. But supposing the noble Lord's Amendment is passed, every borough and every district would be allowed to put up any kind of back-to-back houses if only the medical officer of the district would say they ought to be allowed to do so. That is a serious matter to face. I think we have already agreed that the medical officers of small districts and small boroughs may be subjected to no little pressure from those whose interests are involved. Yet that is what the acceptance of the Amendment will do. You practically say that a back-to-back house is not in itself an objectionable thing. If you say that, you go, I repeat, against the universal opinion of all housing reformers, and, therefore, although very regretfully, I am compelled to say that I cannot agree, although I admit the special circumstances of Leeds, and Leeds alone, to the Amendment of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00877"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member> said the noble Earl the Leader of the House had not answered one specific question that had been put to him&#x2014;namely, why it should be right to tolerate tenements built back to back and refuse the same privilege in the case of houses.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00879"><member>VISCOUNT HILL</member> said the housing question was a difficult one, and it was for that reason he was surprised that the Government did not see their way to accept the
<col>238</col>
Amendment. If they were going to impose a limit as to what kind of houses should be built, they would never get the Bill carried out to any advantage. Every locality should be given the right of using every possible means that lay in their power to build houses that were cheap and sanitary. In this clause it was proposed for the future to entirely prohibit back-to-back houses. The old back-to-back houses, he admitted, were not advantageous to the community, but that class of house had almost entirely disappeared, and under this Bill those that remained would be wiped out on account of their insanitary condition. The sanitary arrangements in back-to-back houses were infinitely better than in tenement houses. He had seen the back-to-back houses in Leeds. They were very attractive and he would say most healthy and sanitary. The reports from the medical officers were most favourable upon them, and he thought it would be a mistake in this Bill that the Government should in any way prevent architects in any part of the country from bringing forward a scheme of this kind, which, after all, had to be sanctioned by the Local Government Board. If the Board did not like the class of back-to-back houses submitted to them, they need not accept the scheme. If the Amendment were carried, it would give other parts of the country an opportunity of following the example of Leeds.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00880"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WAKEFIELD</member> said he had endeavoured to study this extremely difficult question to the best of his ability, and he thought he was right in saying that if the figures for the whole of England with regard to the relative health of the occupiers of back-to-back houses and that of the occupiers of through houses were before their Lordships, it could certainly be proved that the percentage of disease, taking the whole country over, was very much higher in back-to-back houses than in through houses. He had seen the houses in Leeds, and confessed that the question was a very difficult one indeed. The greater part of these houses were beautifully built and were so placed that in the majority of instances, at all events, fair ventilation was possible. Their Lordships would easily understand that when back-to-back houses were placed in groups of four, although they could not get through ventilation from front to back of the house, yet by a judicious opening of the windows they
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0126"/>
<col>239</col>
could get through ventilation in a diagonal way. So far as he had been able to look into the question, he thought that by perpetuating back-to-back houses they were undoubtedly laying up for themselves in most of the great cities of this country a heritage which would afterwards come home with disastrous effect when public opinion on the housing problem was raised to a higher level that it had reached at the present time. With regard to the proviso to this section, the responsibility put on the medical officer of health was, he thought, much too heavy a responsibility to place upon a single individual in that position. He was appointed, in the first instance, by the municipality itself. Was it likely that in a place like Leeds, if the general opinion of the City Council was in favour of perpetuating back-to-back houses, there would ever be a medical officer of health who would not certify that the houses were capable of perfectly free ventilation? It was an unfair position in which to place the medical officer. While he admitted that the houses in Leeds were extremely attractive and were inhabited by a very good class of working people, he sometimes asked himself whether it was not the fact that the position of Leeds, like that of many other Yorkshire towns, was a singularly healthy one, surrounded by moors and fresh air, and that if from the first the other system of building had been persevered in the undoubtedly high state of health in the city might not have become still higher. He would support the Government if the Committee divided.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00881"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> suggested a possible way out of the difficulty. It had been proved by noble Lords connected with Leeds, that it was possible, if back-to-back houses were built upon a certain plan, to erect them in such a way that there could be no objection on the score of health. If that was so, it seemed to him that if they gave the Local Government Board a discretion as to how such back-to-back houses were to be built they would get over a great deal of the objection. This would at any rate surmount the very obvious difficulty of the medical officer of health being brought into the controversy and having to decide the case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00882"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said he was so puzzled by the attitude of His Majesty's Government that he could
<col>240</col>
not help asking for a little more information. The right rev. Prelate who spoke last from the Episcopal Bench was perfectly right when he said that if the death-rate in houses built back to back was compared throughout the whole of the country with that in houses not built back to back, it would be found to be very much larger in the case of back-to-back houses, because it was notorious that back-to-back houses were originally built without any consideration to ventilation or to sanitary conditions at all. He was sorry to say he had some of them and he knew what they were like, and he knew how difficult it was to know how to deal with them. No one would defend such a system. There were two objections to back-to-back houses. One was that as they were ordinarily built through ventilation was impossible. The right rev. Prelate had said that by this method of back-to-back houses it was possible to get through ventilation. He did not quite follow what the right rev. Prelate meant when he spoke of diagonal ventilation, but the point remained that he admitted there was through ventilation. He had heard back-to-back houses denounced that evening from the Front Bench opposite in no measured terms, but he had not yet heard why His Majesty's Government allowed tenement houses to be built in the same way. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said it was not a permission to erect houses back to back, but tenements back to back. Where was the difference? The question was whether these back-to-back tenements were or were not wholesome, or whether they could be properly ventilated. Why did it appear easier to ventilate back-to-back tenements than it was to ventilate back-to-back houses? He had been looking at some of the plans of the houses erected at Leeds, and it appeared to him perfectly easy to build houses in exactly the same form but instead of giving a staircase to each house to put two houses together and let them have a common staircase. Then the houses would become tenements back to back. It seemed to him that the Government were going upon a wrong principle altogether. They seemed to think that there was the reverse of charm about back-to-back houses. The whole question depended upon ventilation. If they could secure ventilation in back-to-back houses, he saw no objection to them. If they could not, then they were excessively bad. Because nine-tenths of the back-to-back
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0127"/>
<col>241</col>
houses had no through ventilation and were excessively bad, why should all back-to-back houses be condemned?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00883"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> said the right rev. Prelate had alluded to figures of back-to-back houses both ancient and modern. He (Lord Monk Bretton) only knew of one set of figures which compared. the present day back-to-back houses with present day through houses; that was the case of Halifax, and the result of that return was very much in favour of back-to-back houses as against through.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00884"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member> felt that the information that had come to them made it extremely difficult to know what line to take. He wondered whether it would be possible to adjourn the debate in order that the statistics might be looked further into. He did not think it was quite reasonable that they should be asked to reverse the matured opinion which had been arrived at for many years past as regarded the structure of old back-to-back houses or the desirability of building new ones on the mere evidence of the quite peculiar position at Leeds. In the first place, the houses at Leeds were all recently built; they were occupied mostly by young couples, and the death-rate was naturally lower than in the general community. The whole of the statistics required fully testing. If they decided this to-night, he ventured to hope it might come up again on Report, because he did not believe that the statistics had been tested as thoroughly as they ought to be as regards England as a whole, and it was surely possible that something could be arrived at which would not impose upon Leeds any great inconvenience and yet maintain the principles which had been supposed to be of the very element of sanitary science.</p>

I understand that there was in another place the fear, groundless as it appears, that some change of the law might appear to be made by this Bill in respect to this question of medical inspection. There is no doubt that under the law as it stands, which, I believe, was made clear when a clause instituting medical inspection was under consideration both in the year 1906 and 1907, the school
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0129"/>
<col>245</col>
authorities cannot compel the subjection of any child to medical inspection should its parents definitely object. Therefore this clause does nothing more than declare the law as it stands. I think, however, it is desirable to state that as a matter of fact the point is not of much importance. Parents, I am glad to think, have not objected to medical inspection. On the contrary, as time goes on, they are becoming more and more convinced of its value. In fact, the very few isolated cases in which any single parent has made an objection has been where they have got it into their heads that the medical inspection has not been strictly medical, but has been done to serve some other purpose. In all cases where inspection has been given, they have been quite satisfied. As I say the fact that the law is thus declared is of no practical importance, and certainly will have no effect in diminishing this extremely valuable medical inspection.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00924">45. Nothing in the Rousing Acts shall authorise the acquisition for the purposes of those Acts of any land which is the site of an ancient monument or other object of arch&#x00E6;ological interest.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00925"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said the provision in Clause 45 was a perfectly proper provision, and had also been enacted in the Small Holdings Act two years ago, but for some reason, which he did not understand, His Majesty's Government had omitted to add to this clause the further words which appeared in the section which dealt with the subject in the Small Holdings Act. He had therefore placed those words on the Paper, so that the clause, if amended as he suggested, would prevent the compulsory acquisition of any land which was the property of any local authority or had been acquired by any corporation or company for the purposes of any railway, dock, canal, water, or other public undertaking, or which at the date of the order formed part of any park, garden, or pleasure ground, or was otherwise required for the amenity or convenience of any dwelling-house. Those provisions, as he had stated, were in the Small Holdings Act, and he believed that only on the previous day His Majesty's Government accepted a precisely similar Amendment in the Development Bill which was now being considered in another place. Therefore he thought he need not detain their Lordships with any arguments in favour of this proposal, which he hoped the Government would be prepared to accept.</p>

<image src="S5LV0003P0I0130"/>
<col>247</col>
to meet the noble Viscount on this point, because in the opinion of the Local Government Board this proviso was not necessary. He was glad that the noble Viscount recognised the merits of the Small Holdings Act, and wished to re-enact in this Bill some of the provisions of that Act. He (Earl Beauchamp) only wished they had been allowed to incorporate more of that Act in the present measure. He desired to point out to the noble Viscount one result if this Amendment was inserted. If on any of the property referred to in the Amendment there were insanitary dwellings which ought to be dealt with, the Amendment would have the effect of preventing them from being dealt with. This was rather a new principle to put into a Bill which dealt with the housing, and it might lead to great inconvenience. There was a case at St. Pancras where a railway company were the freeholders of an insanitary area which was condemned under Part II of the Act, and it was contended that this area had been acquired under the powers of a special Act. Under the Amendment of the noble Viscount that land could not have been dealt with. He might say, on behalf of the Local Government Board, that they would be careful not to hamper any of these undertakings by allowing the compulsory purchase of areas without satisfying themselves that no real detriment would result to the undertaking. But he thought the noble Viscount would agree that it ought not to be in the power of the proprietors of these undertakings to have a veto on improvement schemes unless their wishes were met with regard to monetary or other concessions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00928"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he had no intention of preventing insanitary dwellings being dealt with under Parts I and II of the Housing Act. What he had in his mind was the acquisition of land for the purposes of Part III of the Act. It could not be necessary that for those purposes a local authority should acquire compulsorily, or that the Local Government Board should order the acquisition of, any land which through the working of an Act of Parliament had already been acquired by a local authority or a corporation or a company for the purposes of a railway, dock, canal, water or other public undertaking. There could be no earthly reason why, in framing a new housing scheme under Part III of the Act, other land should not be taken
<col>248</col>
for that purpose. The same argument applied to the acquisition of any park, garden or pleasure ground; it would be perfectly easy for a council desiring to build cottages to acquire other land and not to interfere with parks, gardens or pleasure grounds. Again why, for the purpose of building one man a dwelling, should the amenity or convenience of any other dwelling-house be interfered with? He must press his Amendment, but to meet the objection of the noble Earl he would amend it so as expressly to limit its application to the acquisition of land for the purposes of Part III of the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00929"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said this alteration made a real difference, and without pledging the Local Government Board to the Amendment, he would not at this stage offer any further opposition to it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00933"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> proposed a new clause, after Clause 47, defining the meaning of the expression "working-classes." He said it was imperative that there should be some definition of working-classes in the Bill, because there was nothing at present to show what the working-classes were. The definition which he had put down was a well-known definition. It appeared in the Standing Orders of both Houses of Parliament and he also found it in the Schedule attached to the Housing Act of 1903. The Schedule related to the taking of houses for the working-classes, and at the end this definition was inserted. It was for that reason he had chosen these words, and he moved that the new clause be here inserted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00934">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To insert the following new clause:</quote>
<quote>'48 The expression "working-classes" throughout the Housing Acts, unless the context otherwise requires, shall mean mechanics, artisans, labourers, and others working for wages, hawkers, costermongers, persons not working for wages but working at some trade or handicraft without employing others except members of their own family, and persons whose income does not

exceed an average of thirty shillings a week and such persons as may be residing with them.'" (<i>The Earl of Camperdown.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00935"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> hoped His Majesty's Government would not accept this new clause. The noble Earl who had moved the Amendment had not given much explanation. What on earth did this mean: "whose income does not exceed an average of thirty shillings a week and such persons as may be residing with them?" Was it that a man who had thirty-five shillings a week, or who happened to be a pensioner, or who happened to have had money left to him and was getting thirty-five shillings a week, was not to be included? If so, he thought it was very hard indeed. He hoped this definition would not be accepted in any way, for he was certain it was absolutely unnecessary. To begin with, why define hawkers? Why define costermongers, and not define ratcatchers? If they went in for definition they must define everybody. He hoped the Amendment would not be pressed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00936"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that the noble Earl was, he was afraid, rather an iconoclast. He called into question the Standing Orders of both Houses of Parliament. He (Lord Camperdown) did not make these Standing Orders. Perhaps if he had done so he might have made them slightly different. But what was it the noble Earl did not understand? Did he not understand "persons whose income does not exceed an average of thirty shillings a week."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00937"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, but why is it not thirty-five shillings a week?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00938"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said the next provision was "and" such person as may be residing with them. "He presumed that referred to persons who were residing with persons whose incomes did not exceed an average of thirty shillings a week. That was the only explanation he could give to the noble Earl. It appeared to him that the words had a very clear meaning.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00939"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> said it only made the case more arbitary. Those persons residing with others must only
<col>250</col>
have an average of thirty shillings a week. The scope was not wide enough.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00940"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said their Lordships had already discussed this question on a previous Amendment, and he was in hopes that this clause would not have been pressed that afternoon. But they would see, from what had passed in the course of the various discussions on this Bill, that a definition of this kind, if carried out in the way the Earl of Camperdown proposed, would create very serious difficulties. Housing schemes had been carried out within a short distance of Westminster, and dwellings were occupied by policemen and by classes of workers who would not come within the definition. He had heard that a widow of a baronet was an occupier. Would these people have to be displaced as not coming within the definition? Let him point out how this particular clause suggested by the Earl of Camperdown really came into being. It was taken from the Schedule of the Housing Act of 1903, which dealt with a different point&#x2014;the re-housing of persons who were displaced by public works, and therefore it would not be fair to say that putting this Amendment into this Bill was continuing a policy already adopted by both Houses of Parliament. It would involve a very large investigation on the part of local authorities. They would have to find out exactly the occupation and the wages of those who applied to them for houses. He believed that under this Amendment the local authorities would even have to find out when there was an increase in wages received by the occupiers, and to consider whether any man, who by his own merit received thirty-one shillings a week, ought then to be turned out. It would really be much more to the general convenience that houses of this kind should be dealt with rather on the basis of rental than on the basis of the trades of the people who occupied them. It was obvious that any building society or individual who dealt with these houses on a large scale must find it a great deal more convenient if their Lordships said that houses rented at so much a year came, or did not come, within the scope of the Bill, and that they were not obliged to make these interrogations with regard to the occupations of the people who lived in them. That was a matter of importance to people who conducted building societies or individuals who dealt with these houses on a large
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0132"/>
<col>251</col>
scale, and therefore he ventured to hope that the noble Earl would not press his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00941"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member> said the Amendment also stood on the Paper in his name as well as in the name of the Earl of Camperdown, and the reason he put it down was that in a Bill intended for the housing of the working-classes it seemed to him advisable that there should be some definition of "working-classes," so that these houses should not be open except to the working-classes. The noble Earl opposite did not understand this particular definition, but it happened to be a definition drawn up by the joint wisdom of both Houses of Parliament as being suitable to define the working-classes. He quite agreed that to a certain extent one's opinion as to the advisability of this being passed had been modified by the fact that they had specified the rating of the houses; but still he thought there ought to be some definition, even though they had specified the rating of a house, as to the class of men for which a house was to be built.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00942"><member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY</member> hoped the House would not agree to the Amendment. He had had some experience of this old Standing Order Clause. He remembered a good many years ago when Shaftesbury-avenue and Charing Crossroad were made, the Metropolitan Board of Works had to make a return, and they made what he could only call a fraudulent return. It was proved to be utterly delusive. They left half of the people out; they excluded mechanics on the ground that they were tradesmen and not artisans, and a more correct return of the number of people to be rehoused in that case was called for. The words in the Amendment were "working for wages," and then it went on to say, "persons whose income does not exceed an average of thirty shillings a week." There were plenty of people who were not working for wages, who, nevertheless, ought to be included. Take the collector of an industrial society like the Prudential. He might be able to make from thirty-eight to forty shillings a week on commission, and not on wages, and yet he was in the same social position as a skilled carpenter or smith. Therefore, they ought not to adopt this Amendment. He did not think there were many pensioners with thirty shillings
<col>252</col>
a week; but there was a difference between what was wages and what was salary. Did a schoolmistress or a schoolmaster earn wages or salary? A schoolmaster might be getting, perhaps, a couple of pounds a week, and might be living in one of these houses. He was satisfied that the better, simpler, and more effective way of working this was to take the rental value of these houses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00943"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that the objection which the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had taken to his proposal was one which he did not think held water. If the noble Earl objected to define who the working-classes were, why did he insert the words "working-classes" in the Bill? If the words had no meaning, and if the Bill was to apply to persons who dwelt in houses of a certain rental, why use the term "working-classes?" Lord Sheffield had just said thought it ought to extend far beyond the working-classes. That was a perfectly intelligible position, but what was not intelligible was to describe this as an Act relating to the working-classes, and then when asked to define them to decline to do so. As long as they retained the words "working-classes," surely they ought to attach some definite meaning to them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00944"><member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY</member> said the noble Earl had somewhat misinterpreted what he had said. He only pointed out that the noble Earl's definition was not complete.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00945"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think my noble friend's Amendment has not been quite clearly understood on the other side of the House. It has been said by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, and the noble Lord behind him, that if my noble friend's Amendment were to be accepted the effect would be that certain persons might be turned out of certain houses which they at present occupy. I do not believe that any person can be turned out of any house under this Amendment. The Earl of Kimberley dwelt upon the fact that in the definition of a working-man a rate of thirty shillings a week was mentioned. The noble Lord was apparently under the impression that any one receiving more than thirty shillings a week would be disqualified as not belonging to the working- classes. But that is not so. Under the Amendment any one
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0133"/>
<col>253</col>
who is an artisan, a labourer, or a mechanic even receiving fifty shillings a week would be clearly qualified to be considered a member of the working-classes. With regard to the object and general purpose of my noble friend there can, I think, be no doubt. What we all desire is that if the money of the ratepayers is to be spent upon these housing schemes, which are in so many words described as schemes for the housing of the working-classes, the buildings erected should be occupied by the working-classes and not by people of an utterly different description. That, to my mind, is quite an obvious proposition. It is not only unfair to the ratepayers, but it is very unfair to the working-classes themselves that their places should be taken by people who really have no right to accommodation in buildings erected at the public expense under this Act. It has been truly said that the particular formula adopted by my noble friend has very high sanction indeed, because it is to be found in the Standing Orders of both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, I think, there is <i>prima facie</i> a strong case for the Amendment. But I confess I am tempted to ask, at one point at any rate, whether the Amendment does not propose to go rather further than is desirable, because what the Amendment says is that the expression "working-classes" throughout the Housing Acts shall be construed in this manner. Now under these Acts we have to deal with very different problems. There is, for example, the problem of deciding whether certain premises are fit for human habitation or not. It seems to me that when we are dealing with a case of that kind we ought not to be deterred from deciding whether premises are or are not fit for human habitation because those premises are not exclusively occupied by members of the working-classes. On the other hand, when you come to consider the other case, whether new buildings are to be erected at the public expense, then I. think it is fair to say you shall not erect such buildings unless they are required by and likely to be occupied by members of the working-classes. I would therefore suggest to my noble friend that he might possibly consider whether his Amendment might not be limited in such a way as to make it apply only where the question was the one of providing new housing accommodation under Part II, and not to those other cases which arise under the principal Act.</membercontribution></p>
<col>254</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00946"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I still venture to hope that the noble Earl will not press his Amendment. In the first place, there is the fact, to which my noble friend behind me called attention, that we have already decided upon a rental basis for the purposes of this Act, and it seems to be a serious question whether, having decided on that basis, we should further complicate the matter by this attempted definition. Now this proposal has been commended as being the result of the collective wisdom of Parliament. We all have a great respect for the collective wisdom of Parliament, but I suppose the results of that wisdom are subject to occasional revision, otherwise we should never have any fresh legislation at all. The case in which this definition was employed, as I pointed out on an earlier Amendment, was where, at a given moment, a number of people were removed from their dwellings in consequence of an improvement scheme and had to be re-housed. It, therefore, was comparatively easy at that moment, or ought to have been&#x2014;although the noble Lord behind me pointed out one conspicuous instance where the process had not been successful&#x2014;to find out what the trade or means of a particular individual were. But it becomes entirely a different question when you enter into a continuous process of finding houses for persons whose means and position may alter from time to time. This definition has been subject to some examination. I confess that the definition itself, apart from the question of having a definition at all, seems to me altogether unsatisfactory. My noble friend who leads the Opposition pointed out that the provision was not limited to persons who earn thirty shillings a week, but that artisans and others earning a great deal more than that sum would be eligible. That, to me, is one of the principal objections to the definition. I should have thought that a person earning thirty-five shillings a week and not as an artisan was a far more suitable subject for these houses than a person earning a weekly wage of five or six pounds who would be eligible. Any one who earns wages at a handicraft himself without employing any one else would be eligible, but that is a definition which, I take it, would include the President of the Royal Academy. Therefore it seems to me reasonable to say that the definition itself is faulty and incomplete. Surely we can be content

<col>255</col>
with the rental limit. Nobody supposes that people of large means and leisure are going to live in these cheap municipal houses. No abuse of those houses I should have thought could possibly arise. There might be some eccentric person living on a pound a week even though he may have some money put by, who conceivably might become a candidate for such houses; but such cases would be exceedingly rare, and I should think the rental limit would be found to be quite a sufficient safeguard. I trust that the Committee will not accept the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00947"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he understood the noble Earl to prefer the rental basis to the definition of the working-classes laid down by Lord Camper-down. But where was the rental limit laid down? He could not find it anywhere excepting in that clause which related to contracts between landlord and tenant, and made the landlord responsible for the proper upkeep of the house. That was a rental limit which had not been settled by their Lordships. But that did not apply to the provisions of the Bill, which related to the putting in force of Part III of the Housing of the Working-Classes Act by the local authority. The local authority under the Bill as it now stood might build houses if they chose of a rental of &#x00A3;100 a year or more, and the Local Government Board might compel them, subject to the provisions of the Bill, to build houses of any size or value, quite irrespective of any rental limit. If His Majesty's Government were prepared to accept the principle of a rental limit so as to define the class of houses which were to be built for the working-classes, he thought his noble friend might not care to press his Amendment; but surely there ought to be some kind of definition, either by a rental, or of the person by whom these houses were to be occupied.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00948"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said it was quite clear, if the Amendment was pressed, His Majesty's Government would be obliged to put their Lordships to the trouble of a Division. If, on the other hand, there was a general disposition to accept the principle of a rental, he thought they should not trouble their Lordships to divide. He thought they might agree to the rental as a basis for future consideration.</p>
<col>256</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00949"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said he was quite prepared to accept the Amendment which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition had suggested, and for that purpose he would propose to insert at the beginning of his Amendment the words, "In any case relating to the provision of housing accommodation which may arise under Part III of the principal Act." That, he thought, would carry out the Amendment; but with regard to the case itself, he was bound to say he could not understand why the Government were so determined not to define the working-classes. He did not know why they used the words at all. Why put in the term "working-classes" if they did not attach any definite meaning to it? He proposed to insist on his Amendment now, and if the noble Earl would bring up on the Report stage a clause based upon rental he would be perfectly prepared then to consider whether it could come in as a substitute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00950"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said he could well understand, and he thought there was reason in, the objection by His Majesty's Government to the clause as it was framed. As a definition applying to all the clauses of this Bill it would create difficulty. But it was desirable there should be some definition of working-classes for the purpose of directing the local authority, and through this Act the Local Government Board, as to what was the state of things which would justify them in allowing housing schemes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00951"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member> then put the Amendment in its amended form&#x2014;viz.:

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00954">Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00955">Clause 48:</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00956">48. The expression "street" shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the same meaning in Part I of the principal Act as it has in Part II of that Act, and shall consequently include any court, alley, street, square, or row of houses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00957"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> moved to delete the words "and shall consequently include any court, alley, street, square, or row of houses." He said this was purely a drafting question, but he thought it opened rather an important point. His reason for proposing this Amendment was that up to the present time Parliament had legislated and the Courts of Law had decided what the consequences of that legislation were.
<col>258</col>
Sometimes they had found it rather difficult, he believed, to understand, but still that had been the duty of the Law Courts. Here Parliament was invited to undertake the duty of interpreting its own Act, and he could not help thinking that was a somewhat dangerous precedent. He would quote a case, which he admitted was extreme, but he was putting it to show what the possible difficulty might be. Suppose in Part II of the principal Act the word "court" happened not to have been mentioned. Such errors had occurred in Acts of Parliament before now. How was the judicial body to whom the question would be referred to decide whether it was included or not? They first of all had a direct statement that the expression "street" meant what it meant in another Act. Then they would find a
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0136"/>
<col>259</col>
statement here that it meant something which was not in that Act, because the word "court" would not be in that Act, and therefore he presumed it would be argued that the word "court" was not included in this Act. And then they found that curious word "consequently," from which one might argue that as it was omitted in the principal Act the consequence was that it was included in this Act. He did not know how in a case of that sort a clause of this kind could be interpreted, and he submitted that it was not advisable that they should set a precedent by interpreting the clauses of their own legislation. He thought it an innovation, and he submitted it would be better if they left out these words, simply stating what they desired to enact and leaving the consequences of that Act to be decided in the ordinary way.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00959"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the Government did not attach any great importance to this. It was a small and humble attempt on the part of the Local Government Board to obviate that system of legislation by reference of which one heard frequent complaints on both sides of the House. Beyond that the Clause had no object, and there was no sinister idea on the part of the Local Government Board in putting it in. If the noble Duke still objected to the clause as it stood, the Government would not press it, but at the same time they were inclined to prefer the words in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00960"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> hoped the noble Duke would not press his Amendment. It was a useful clause, and in another capacity he should probably thank His Majesty's Government for having left it in, so that he would not have to turn up Part II of the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00961"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am not quite sure that the noble Duke understands the position.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00966"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said he sincerely hoped it would. He would not press his Amendment as he did not get any-support, but he still submitted that it was not the duty of Parliament to avoid the consequences of legislation by reference by giving advice to His Majesty's Judges. He would be happy to assist the Lord Chief Justice, but this was not the way to do it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00967">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00968"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said it was a well known rule that when they could not get all they asked for, they should take what they could get, as Lord Dartmouth did the other day. He suggested to the Government that the word "consequently" should be omitted.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-00977"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> moved to omit this clause. The object of the clause was to repeal the present section of the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0137"/>
<col>261</col>
principal Act with regard to the amount of land round the cottage. The principal Act said half an acre, and this clause brought it up to an acre. He moved this Amendment because he did not think an acre was required, and if it was not required it was a waste of land and a waste of the ratepayers' money. Their Lordships had just defined "working-classes." He did not think that any one man could cultivate an acre; and if a costermonger with his family, who were referred to in the definition, desired to have an acre he could get it under the Small Holdings Act. This was an Act for the housing of the working-classes and not an Act for providing small holdings, and since this Committee had been sitting the President of the Board of Agriculture had told them what splendid progress that Act was making.</p>

<quote>"To leave out Clause 50."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Monk Bretton.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00979"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said His Majesty's Government preferred the clause to remain, although the noble Lord had stated quite fairly and accurately the result of the Amendment. The present definition in Section 53 did provide that "cottage" should include a garden and half an acre; but as a matter of fact, the noble Lord's Amendment would go further, because its effect would be to get rid of these provisions as to a garden altogether. That was, of course, a small point which, no doubt, the noble Lord would remedy. But there might be instances in which land was very cheap, and in which for some reason or another it was practicable and desirable to provide a rather larger share of land than half an acre. In those circumstances it would be rather a pity to preserve a limit of half an acre. He thought it undesirable to hamper the provision of open spaces and desirable garden ground.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00980"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said there was one point as to this which the Government might have overlooked. The subsection also dealt with the limit value. If that clause was passed, the limit of value would be gone as well. He did not think the Government meant that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-00981"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said it would be a very extreme measure to enable a local authority to assign a garden of an acre to a cottage. It would mean an increase of
<col>262</col>
taxes to the occupier, and the unfortunate individual might lay himself open to further taxes under another Bill which their Lordships might see presently. If the Amendment was pressed, he should support it, but he hoped if it was not pressed that the noble Earl would put in a limit of value, and he thought it ought to be a much closer one than the one originally proposed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01013">Clause 53, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01014">Clause 54:</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01015"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member> moved an Amendment in Clause 54 (Preparation and approval of town-planning scheme), providing that a town-planning scheme might be made in accordance with the Act in respect of any land which was in course of development, but omitting the phrase "or appears likely to be used for building purposes." He urged that these words were of doubtful necessity as well as of undoubted danger to the working of the Bill. The clause gave the authority power to take land which was neither defined in area nor in respect of time limit, and its exercise was bound to be a source of danger and of constant friction in a neighbourhood. Another danger was a continuance of the principle of legislation by vague definition. A great deal would be gained if His Majesty's Government were satisfied to confine these schemes to land in course of development; or he was willing to go as far as to say to land that was about to be developed; but he protested against land being included without any time or quantity being mentioned. He could imagine some ambitious town with a very large town-planning scheme in its mind taking land in the vicinity of a village and erecting there a crematorium or a dust destructor, and, not impossibly, an infectious hospital. He had a case in his mind where a local authority put up an infectious hospital close to a village, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that that hospital was removed. Unlimited power of this kind might put a neighbourhood to a great deal of expense, and agricultural land might be detrimentally affected. Supposing a town-planning scheme was made for a period of twenty years. The owners of the land would find it greatly diminished in value for agricultural purposes. No one would take the land, because if they had a town-planning scheme over their heads which might be put into operation tomorrow, or within the next ten years, it would be impossible for any one to say to
<col>266</col>
a tenant. "I will let you have land for such and such a term." Then again, the character of the population of a town might change, One industry might die and another spring up. Or if it was a watering place it might gradually decay, and the need for expansion would not be there. His objection was increased by subsection (7), which proposed to give to the Local Government Board the power to decide what land was likely to be used for building purposes. Although he had the greatest respect for the officials of the Local Government Board and particularly for the present President, the officials of the Board were not infallible. They came down with no knowledge whatever of the intricacies and the delicacies of local conditions, such as was possessed by those living on the spot. When the time came he proposed to omit that subsection. He did not wish to put their Lordships to the trouble of a Division, and he therefore hoped they would receive an assurance that this clause was not to remain as it now stood in the Bill. He did not know whether the noble Earl himself would be inclined to meet hint in any way, and suggest an Amendment defining both the area of the land which might be taken and the time in which it might be required.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01017"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is not the only member of the House whose attention has been attracted to the dangerous vagueness of the words which he desires to omit from this section, and the words are the more alarming if you pass on to subsection (7), under which it appears that land likely to be used for building purposes is to include any land likely to be used "for the purpose of providing open spaces, roads, streets, parks, pleasure or recreation grounds." If these words remain as they are, there seems to be scarcely any limit to the power which would be given to the Local Government Board of declaring almost any land that it pleases as land "likely to be used for building purposes"; and I share my noble friend's opinion that it is necessary to find some means of removing the blot upon which he has put his finger. But I rose for the purpose of pointing out, if
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0140"/>
<col>267</col>
I may do so, to him and to the Committee, that Lord Cawdor has given notice of an Amendment in Clause 54 which will have the effect of introducing an entirely new procedure for the purpose of dealing with all the questions which arise under this part of the Bill. There are obviously two ways in which you can deal with difficulties of this kind. You can meet them by a series of extremely minute and elaborate definitions, or you can meet them by adding to the Bill some machinery more likely to inspire the public with confidence, and by depriving the Local Government Board of its unrestricted power of disposing finally of these questions. I venture to think that the latter plan, the plan suggested by Lord Cawdor, is likely to be the more effectual of the two, and if my noble friend and another noble Lord who has a somewhat similar Amendment immediately following his in the Bill are disposed to share that view respectfully suggested by me, it would be for the convenience of the House that instead of going on with the discussion of these minute provisions we should pass on to the much larger question of principle dealt with by Lord Cawdor in his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01018"><member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY</member> pointed out that Earl Cawdor's proposed new clause was not in substitution of the clause they were now on, but was consequential, and he saw also that Earl Cawdor had one or two Amendments on detail in the clause they were now on before they came to his proposed new clause. He understood the usefulness of discussing the machinery proposed to be laid down by the noble Earl, but of course a good deal would depend on what was done now as the new clause would be consequential on the clause now before them unless they were going to pass this clause in the form in which the Government had drafted it. The new clause, as he said, would be consequential, but every town planning scheme would have to be promoted in accordance with whatever conditions were laid down in Clause 54.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01019"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he was much obliged to the Marquess of Lansdowne for the suggestion he had made, and, in spite of what his noble friend behind him had just said, he thought it would be a convenient course to take the general discussion to which the noble Marquess referred on Earl Cawdor's Amendment.
<col>268</col>
He was sure that would be most conducive to the convenience of their Lordships and in the end save time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01020">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01021"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CAWDOR,</member> on a formal Amendment to omit subsections (4) and (5), dealt with a proposal which under a proposed new clause would introduce a totally different procedure in relation to confirmation of town planning schemes. He said the Amendments of which he had given notice comprised two parts, and it would be more convenient that he should deal with the whole question at the outset, because the Bill was dominated by the first Amendment which he was proposing and which would exclude subsections (4) and (5). With regard to the general objects of this Clause and of this part of the Bill, he was sure their Lordships would all agree that they were anxious that town-planning schemes should be made with the general object mentioned in the first subsection of the clause&#x2014;namely, with "the general object of securing proper sanitary conditions, amenity, and convenience in connexion with the laying out and use of the land, and of any neighbouring lands." He wished to say nothing that might interfere in any degree with those conditions and with that general object. His objections were solely to the procedure under which schemes were to be brought into effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01022">The powers given to the Local Government Board under these sections were gravely excessive, excessive to an extent he thought they had hardly met with before. They were powers without any appeal against them, and he hoped to be able to persuade their Lordships to strike out those cowers and to put in their place a clause which he would ask their Lordships to insert after Clause 54 He might say that it was a clause based upon a clause in the Act of 1890, modified to some extent by the Act of 1903. The key of his Amendments was subsection (5) of this clause. Subsection (5) laid down that&#x2014;
<quote>"a town planning scheme, when approved by the Local Government Board, shall have effect as if it were enacted in this Act."</quote>
To that he took strong exception. Under subsection (6) the Local Government Board were given power, after having had
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0141"/>
<col>269</col>
the power of turning a town-planning scheme into an Act of Parliament, of varying or revoking any town-planning scheme apparently without hindrance or without any appeal. Further power was given to the Board to decide whether land was likely to be used for building purposes, and by the first subsection of Clause 55 power was given to the Board to prescribe a set of general provisions for carrying out the general objects of town-planning schemes. These general provisions were set out in the Fourth Schedule, and it' would be found they were powers of a very excessive character, snore excessive than he had found in any Act given to a Government Department.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01023">Streets, roads and highways might be stopped up or diverted&#x2014;a far-reaching power to give to a Government Department without appeal. Buildings, structures, and erections came next, and there was no limit to the regulations that might be made. And then they passed to "open spaces, private and public." There was no limitation as to the powers of the Board in dealing with open spaces, or as to which were to be retained, and how they were to be dealt with. These general provisions appearing in the Fourth Schedule were under nineteen heads, but he would deal with one or two more. In No. 9 they would find that the matters to be dealt with were the "extinction or variation of private rights of way and other easements." Those matters were to be dealt with on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Local Government Board, with no appeal. No. 12 was as to the "power of the responsible authority to remove, alter, or demolish any obstructive work." The "responsible authority" mentioned there was the authority who had the responsibility given to them by the Local Government Board. He would like the noble Earl to tell them what was the limitation under that provision. What might not be obstructive work? He believed the House in which their Lordships were now sitting would escape under certain conditions, but he was informed that the National Liberal Club would certainly not escape. Any building that was in the way as an obstructive building was liable under this section to be swept away by the Local Government Board by a stroke of the pen and without appeal. He passed over Nos. 13 and 14 in the Schedule, not because they were not important, but because he
<col>270</col>
wished to call attention to No. 15, which was, to his mind, a very astonishing paragraph. The matter to be dealt with there by the Local Government Board was no less than this&#x2014;that in these schemes I they might apply, "with the necessary modifications and adaptations" statutory enactments. How was there to be an "application with the necessary modifications and adaptations of statutory enactments?" What was the meaning of modifying a statutory enactment? How far might they modify it, and what must they leave of it? If the power of modification were granted he supposed they would be able to modify an enactment practically out of existence. That was a very astonishing power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01024">There were, in addition to the general provisions which might be made for every scheme, special provisions in Clause 55, subsection (2), which modified, or might modify as was thought right, the general provisions. Those special provisions were to be inserted in every town-planning scheme, defining the area to which the scheme was to apply, and the authority who was to be responsible. These special provisions might be used for suspending, so far as was necessary for the proper carrying out of the scheme, any statutory enactments, by-laws, regulations, or other provisions, under whatever authority made, which were in operation in the area, included in the scheme. Those sweeping powers, he thought, spoke pretty well for themselves. They might sweep away private Acts, by-laws, and regulations; he did not know what the suspension of an Act of Parliament meant. He had hitherto-understood that an Act of Parliament remained in force until it was repealed, but here they had the power given to a Government Department to suspend a statutory enactment. It was true that in the next paragraph it was provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"Where the scheme contains provisions suspending any enactment contained in a public general Act, the scheme shall not come into force unless a draft thereof has been laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than forty days during a session of Parliament."</quote>
By that a public general Act was safeguarded as far as suspension was concerned; but, in view of provision 15 of Schedule 4 relating to the application with the necessary modifications and adaptations of statutory enactments, even a public general Act did not appear to be guarded from modification and. adaptation. There they
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0142"/>
<col>271</col>
would have absolutely an interference with general public statutes by the Local Government Board. He would like to know of any instance in which a provision such as this had ever been sanctioned and inserted in an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01025">He passed to subsection (3) of Clause 55. Under subsection (3) interference with local authorities by a Government Department was authorised. The subsection read&#x2014;
<quote>"Where land included in a town-planning scheme is in the area of more than one local authority, the responsible authority may be, as the Local Government Board directs, one of those local authorities, or for certain purposes of the scheme one local authority and for certain purposes another local authority, or a joint body constituted specially."</quote>
That appeared to him to be a very wide power to give to the Local Government Board in the matter of interference with local authorities. Imagine two or three large local authorities, and the area for a town-planning scheme spreading over a part of each of their areas. Each of them might be large urban authorities capable of dealing very well with this matter; but it was to be decided absolutely and finally by the Local Government Board itself. What had become of the great confidence of the Liberal party in local authorities? Here was an absolute and direct interference with local authorities in a way which was most undesirable and most unfair.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01026">In Clause 57 they would find that the responsible authority might, under certain conditions, remove, pull down, or alter any building or other work in the area included in the scheme which was such as to contravene the scheme, or in the erection or carrying out of which any provision of the scheme had not been complied with. Here a building was to be pulled down, not after the people had been heard, not after their rights had been protected or after a Court of Law had decided on the point but simply and solely upon the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the President of the Local Government Board. That was a very strong method of dealing with these cases. But they would notice in all these cases the same thing happened. In all cases of interference with a local authority or the private property of individuals appeared the same fear of a Court of Law, of Parliament, or of Parliamentary inquiry. Shelter was always taken behind the absolute power
<col>272</col>
of the Government Department. He thought they had strayed far enough in that direction and he hoped their Lordships would be firm in resisting any further straying in that direction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01027">Before he went to another point he was anxious to ask one question with regard to Clause 60, and he asked it because although he was not amending Clause 60 he was endeavouring to amend the method by which any of these schemes was to be brought into operation. Clause 60 provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"The responsible authority may for any purpose purchase any land comprised in a town-planning scheme by agreement, or be authorised to purchase," etc.</quote>
Was it intended that the authority that might purchase land under this clause might also carry out the town-planning scheme for itself? Was it intended that town-planning schemes should be worked by the authority who was allowed to purchase this land, or, having purchased it, what were they to do with it? He was informed that if this clause passed as it was there would be a power under the existing law for a local authority, the "responsible authority" as it was under this clause, to deal with that land for the purpose of small holdings, and for the purpose of building cottages with gardens up to an acre in extent. Was it intended to give the responsible local authority the power of running town-planning schemes for itself or its own land and with its own houses? He hoped the Government would give them clear information on that point. In Clause 61 they would find again somewhat severe methods of dealing with local authorities by the Local Government Board. That clause said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Local Government Board are satisfied on any representation&#x2014;"</quote>
He did not know whether there was any qualifying of those words in the minds of His Majesty's Government, but "any representation" seemed a little loose and a little wide. It need not be anyone in the district. It might be the Sultan of Turkey&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Local Government Board are satisfied on any representation, after holding a local enquiry, that a local authority (<i>a</i>) have failed to take the requisite steps for having a satisfactory town-planning scheme. &#x2026; the Board may, as the case requires, order the local authority to prepare and submit for the approval of the Board such a town-planning scheme."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0143"/>
<col>273</col>
He supposed that would be called, to use an inelegant phrase, "gingering" the local authority. And they "gingered" them to some purpose under this clause, for if they would turn to subsection (3) they would find the words&#x2014;
<quote>"any order under this section may be enforced by <i>mandamus.</i>"</quote>
They used to hear a good deal about enforcement by <i>mandamus</i>. It was a derided power, and one which they could never enforce, and was perfectly useless for what it was intended. Perhaps he was putting it too high, but it appeared that His Majesty's Government had now come to the quite definite conclusion that the proper way to "ginger" local authorities was to issue a <i>mandamus</i>, and probably imprison the lot. That was rather extraordinary if that was to be the method of encouraging local authorities to carry out these great schemes. He hoped he had established to their Lordships' satisfaction that these powers proposed to be given to the Local Government Board were not only unusual, but excessive, unfair, and unwise. He proposed later on to ask their Lordships to insert a new clause which, as he said, was based upon the Acts of 1890 to 1903. He would not go into details now, but would deal with it when the time arrived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01028">He might be told that there were two objections&#x2014;first of all, that in dealing with other people's land and great schemes of town planning and in "gingering" local authorities the saving of time was a great thing. He agreed with the noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, in disliking any unseemly hurry. Whatever was done should be done deliberately. They might be told that that was one objection to a Provisional Order. He did not want to labour it, or to go too much in detail into it, but he would have plenty to say if that point was raised. He thought a Provisional Order was often a rapid method of procedure. A. great many of the schemes dealt with under Provisional Orders were practically unopposed, and those that were opposed were those very schemes that required thoughtful and careful consideration, schemes which ought not to be carried through in a hurry, but which should be deliberately dealt with, and with a judicial mind. Then he was told that the costs of a Provisional Order were heavy. Would the noble Earl tell them what the average
<col>274</col>
costs amounted to? He thought the noble Earl would find he could not make a very strong case on the ground of cost. In the smaller cases the costs were insignificant, and when they came to large cases, such as the amalgamation of boroughs, the costs there, of course, were very heavy. But in a case of that kind, would they do any better by having an inquiry held in the locality itself? He protested against the idea that they were to shave down too closely the question of cost and time when they were taking away people's property, when "gingering" local authorities, and when dealing with obstructions like the National Liberal Club, for example. He thought that all those matters, particularly the latter, should be done quietly, even if surely and certainly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01029">He thoroughly agreed that these town-planning schemes were very important matters; but only a short time ago the President of the Local Government Board himself said that many of his schemes involved looking ahead for perhaps as long a period as fifty years, and he mentioned the town of Glasgow in that respect. Surely if they had to look forward fifty years there was time for judicial thought and action to secure the rights of those people whose property they might be interfering with. Then it might be asked&#x2014;Why do you not trust Government Departments? He had every wish to trust Government Departments. They used to be able to trust them. He wished they could say that their confidence in them had been increased of recent years. They on that side of the House, and he thought noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite, had not forgotten the Swansea case. That was a case which he was certain many noble Lords on the other side of the House did not look back upon with any pleasurable recollections, and a case which he was sure they did not think reflected much credit on the Department concerned. That was not a case of a mistake by one head of one Department. It was a case where the harsh treatment of the Swansea schools went on for years under three different heads of the Education Department, and their dealing with these schools was backed up and fomented by members of the Cabinet. Therefore they had not a failing by one Minister, but a deliberate policy carried on by Minister after Minister to tyrannise over the schools that Parliament in confidence had confided to their care. Such a
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0144"/>
<col>275</col>
thing as that shook and shattered their opinion of and confidence in Government Departments. He wished it were not so. He wished they could feel, as they ought to be able to feel, that they could rely on every Government Department and every Government to carry out judicially every power that Parliament placed in their hands. He now asked their Lordships to strike out these subsections, and he would ask them later on to insert the clause to which he had already referred. They should take the line, and endeavour to adhere to it, that in dealing with Acts of Parliament only Parliament should undo or take away the powers it had given. He would apply the same argument to by-laws. Only those who had passed and sanctioned by-laws should be allowed to touch those by-laws hereafter, and no smaller authority should be allowed to take away powers given by a higher authority. Here they had an interference by a Government Department in every possible direction with statutory enactments. He apologised for being so long in endeavouring to substantiate his case, and concluded by moving his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01031"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he did not think any apology was necessary from the noble Earl who had just sat down own, and who had put in such an interesting way what he considered to be the ultimate results of the Amendments he had placed upon the Paper. They were glad to hear at the beginning of his speech the noble Earl say he was not without some approval of town-planning schemes in their essence, but as his speech went on and he developed his various objections to different parts of the scheme it seemed to him that the noble Earl was able to dissemble his affection for those sections of the Bill very effectively indeed. But they had now come to discuss a very different set of subjects from those they had been discussing during the last two days. The circumstances were entirely different, and he thought they ought to set their minds to consider these clauses of the Bill in a very different spirit from that in which they considered the earlier parts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01032">There was a very real difference between the two parts of the Bill. In the part before them, for instance, the whole idea of His
<col>276</col>
Majesty's Government was that there would be willing co-operation between the various local authorities and owners. There had been that anxiety for co-operation in the past in various parts of the country, but it had been impossible to give effect to the desires of the various authorities and owners because the laws of the country were not adequate to meet the case, and those who had tried to carry out what they hoped would be the result of these sections had been hampered by the want of those very provisions which His Majesty's Government had put into this part of the Bill. They had to consider a totally different set of circumstances. The noble Earl, in the various Amendments he had put down, began by entirely altering the procedure. He believed there would be little or no friction in carrying through these schemes, and therefore no need of the elaborate provisions for the protection of various interests which the noble Earl had brought forward.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01033">Clause 54, from which the noble Earl wished in the first place to omit various subsections, did not deal with the buying of land, but rather with the disposition of land, which was a totally different question. The idea was really to prevent the wrong disposition of land, to prevent the building of streets in places where there ought to be, for instance, a road, to prevent a single owner from putting up a cul-de-sac when it was very much to the advantage of all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood that there should be a through street in that particular place. Again, it was not the idea of His Majesty's Government that this part of the Bill would necessarily involve very large or expensive purchases of land, and in view of the fact that there was a general consensus of opinion on the part of social and housing reformers in this country that we were behindhand with regard to the question of town planning, he felt very much disappointed that these Clauses of the Bill had not received a warmer welcome from noble Lords on the opposite Benches. He would say, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, that in regard to some Amendments&#x2014;the Amendment, for instance, standing in the name of Lord Clinton, and another Amendment standing in the name of Lord Ritchie, and a third in the name of the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, dealing with Clauses 54 and 55 and with the last words at the bottom of page twenty-seven of Clause 58&#x2014;His Majesty's Government were
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0145"/>
<col>277</col>
prepared to meet noble Lords opposite so far as they could with varying degrees of concession, and they had not been without hope that something of that kind might have met the case. But he was afraid, from what had fallen from the noble Earl that there was very little chance indeed that they would be able to come to an agreement on the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01034">The noble Earl had stated quite accurately that one of the objections His Majesty's Government took to the procedure which he advocated was on the question of cost. As it happened, he had fortified, himself with an old Return showing the expenses incurred by local authorities in that connection. It was a Return from the Home Office, dated August 6, 1900, and it was signed by Mr. Jesse Collings, who at that time was Under-Secretary for the Home Office. There they had the expenses under Provisional Orders set out, and without taking any special Order, he would read the list to their Lordships consecutively, and this would give at any rate a broad idea of the amount of expenses involved&#x2014;
<quote>"Provisional Orders: Urban District Council of Clayton, &#x00A3;224; Colwyn Bay, &#x00A3;984; Cottingham, 10 guineas; Cowes, &#x00A3;1,405; Cromer, &#x00A3;50; Dartford, &#x00A3;233; Denton, &#x00A3;250; Dorking, &#x00A3;196; Dronfield, &#x00A3;57; Droylsden, &#x00A3;200; Dukinfield. &#x00A3;240; East Barnet Valley, &#x00A3;95; East Ham, &#x00A3;899; East Stonehouse, &#x00A3;332; Enfield, 5 guineas; Epping, &#x00A3;35; Epsom, &#x00A3;246; Esher &#x00A3;125; Exmouth, &#x00A3;25; Farnworth, &#x00A3;184."</quote>
He gave their Lordships those figures just as they came consecutively, and it was easy from them to strike a general average of what the expenses were. He hoped the noble Earl would allow him to say that he did not think the case of the Potteries was really a case on all fours with what was likely to happen from this part of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01035"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member> interposed to say that he did not suggest it was so. He merely instanced it as one of the largest and heaviest cases that had been tried in that way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01036"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought they were in agreement in thinking that the questions which would come before the Local Government Board in connection with town planning would not be of anything like that importance. The questions which would come before the Local Government Board would not arise in that connection. They would be nothing like the case which
<col>278</col>
the noble Earl mentioned, and to bring in the particular instance of the Potteries was likely to give an unfair impression. Under the scheme which the noble Earl himself proposed there was also a considerable amount of delay involved. One single person interested in a scheme which affected a very large number of people could, if he wished, put all the other parties to the trouble, expense, and delay of defending the scheme by counsel in Parliament. He thought their Lordships would see that, giving that power to a single individual would enable him to bring very strong pressure to bear upon the other parties to give him exceptional benefits&#x2014;benefits to which he was not really properly entitled. It was commonly known that the opposition to Bills and Provisional Orders was very often bought off, and he thought it very desirable to prevent such a thing as that in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01037">He did not think there was anything in the observations of the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, which caused him more regret than his statement that what had happened in connection with the Swansea case had both shaken and shattered his confidence in Government Departments. He could not help hoping that that was a somewhat exaggerated statement of his feelings. There were two other special eases to which the noble Earl had called attention. One was the case of Clause 60. With regard to that, the noble Earl had asked him whether it was the intention of His Majesty's Government that the responsible authority should themselves carry out the large works which in his opinion were involved. The answer to that, he thought, was quite simple. They did not wish to put anything into the Bill which would prevent local authorities from carrying out such works as roads, for example. Very often the local authority was the best qualified body to deal with roads; they had all the machinery for doing it. On the other hand, there was nothing in the Bill, and they did not mean to put anything into the Bill, which would prevent those works, and works of a similar character, being given to contractors, and when all was said and done it was not within the mind of His Majesty's Government that the local authority would have any very large works to do under that part. The idea rather was that individual owners&#x2014;very often, it might be, they were speculative builders&#x2014;or semi-public bodies
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0146"/>
<col>279</col>
such as garden city trusts, should have facilities given to them, and should have power to build more cheaply and effectively than they had been able to do in the past.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01038">There was one other case with regard to which the noble Earl specially asked him to say something, and that was the case of statutory enactments. He thought it might be a good thing if they deferred until they came to that point a full discussion of the matter, but he would like, in answer to the noble Earl, to point out that the term "statutory enactments" included not only public Acts but also local Acts. Local Acts very often contained provisions, upon which he would say something when they came to that clause, with regard to which His Majesty's Government would like in certain cases to give this power of appeal; but with regard to public Acts, as the noble Earl himself pointed out, they did make requisite the Provisional Order. Beyond that, until they came to the various other Amendments, he did not see that he could very usefully say more, except that this was a very important section in a very important part of the Bill, and it was with very great regret that His Majesty's Government, and the Local Government Board in particular, had seen the Amendments introduced by the noble Earl, with all the authority of the big battalions behind him, because they could not but feel that the carrying of those Amendments would go very far to prevent the practical use of powers which they believed would be of real benefit to town-planning schemes in the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01039"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member> asked the permission of the House to leave the Chair for a few minutes for the purpose of addressing their Lordships on the Amendment before the Committee, because, as Chairman of Committees of their Lordships' House, it was one with which he had a detailed acquaintance. In the first place, the noble Earl who had just sat down expressed his regret that a warmer welcome had not been given to that part of the Bill. He had listened with very great care to the remarks that fell from his noble friend behind him, and he did not hear one single word which led him to understand that he objected in any way to these clauses. What he objected to was, not to town-planning schemes, but to the authority
<col>280</col>
which was to be the judge of how those schemes were to be carried out. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill had said that this was entirely different from the parts of the Bill which their Lordships had been discussing up to now, but he would point out that in the part of the Bill then before them, as much as in any other part of the Bill, the Local Government Board had the power to decide as to the removal of obstructive buildings, as to the taking of land, and as to the carrying out of the plan in an area of a local authority other than the local authority which was responsible for the town-planning scheme. The noble Earl went on to say that he believed, there would be a concensus of opinion on the part of landowners local authorities, and all those concerned, that the town-planning part of the Bill Was a desirable one. He dared say that was the case, but, if there were no opposition to a scheme the Provisional Order would not come into being at all. The Amendment which his noble friend behind him had proposed was that only where the Order was opposed, or where it repealed a statutory enactment, should the procedure be by Provisional Order. If everybody was agreed and anxious to have the scheme, the Order would be confirmed by the Local Government Board without any further trouble and expense. To that his noble friend had no objection whatever.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01040">The noble Earl had quoted to their Lordships some figures with regard to the cost of Provisional Orders. He ventured to say that they had been very considerably magnified. In the first place, they would have to have an inquiry of some kind under the scheme proposed in the Bill. It would be a local inquiry; a Local Government Board Inspector would go down to the locality, the parties would appear before him by counsel, and probably with witnesses, and a considerable expense would necessarily be incurred there. He did not know whether the figures which the noble Earl quoted were the costs of promoting the Provisional Orders in Parliament, or whether they included the cost of the local inquiry on the spot. He rather suspected that they included the latter; if so, he ventured to say that they were no true guide to what would be the cost under the scheme proposed by his noble friend.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01041">It was somewhat peculiar that his
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0147"/>
<col>281</col>
Majesty's Government had taken the exactly opposite view in the discussion on another Bill, because while the noble Earl had been telling their Lordships that the cost of a Provisional Order was very great., he found that not long ago when another Bill was under consideration in the other House&#x2014;the Trade Boards Bill&#x2014;there was considerable doubt expressed by members of the Labour Party lest it should be difficult to include other trades in the Bill because of the great expense of the Provisional Order. They were then told by the representative of His Majesty's Government that Provisional Orders for the most part went through without opposition; that the Board of Trade in ten years had brought in 1,160 Provisional Orders, and of them 1,011 were confirmed by Parliament; and that the Provisional Order procedure need not be, and was not in the majority of cases, half so cumbrous or expensive as was usually believed. If that was so in the case of the Board of Trade, it would be very extraordinary if it should be entirely different in the case of the Local Government Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01042">Then the noble Earl took exception to the time which might be consumed by Provisional Orders. He thought the noble Earl who led the House said a night or two ago that it might be as long as two years. He thought that was a very remote possibility. Possibly if proceedings were commend in January of one year, the local inquiry night be prolonged for such a period that it would not be possible to get the Provisional Order in that session of Parliament, and it would have to be put off till the next session. He ventured to say that two years was an outside limit, and a limit which had never been reached, and was certainly not likely to be reached in any ordinary case. The real fact of the matter was that the expense of a Provisional Order was not in the taking of small pieces of land, but in quarrels between two great local authorities. Where they had a Provisional Order for the extension of a borough, for instance, the ratepayers of the county not unnaturally took strong exception to having a large portion of their rateable area taken away from them, and there was usually a very severe fight over it. Sometimes there was a proposal for the exercise of control by one local authority within the area of another local authority, and there,
<col>282</col>
again, there arose a very considerable fight. But their only desire was to discharge their duties towards their constituents and when they went before the Local Government Board Inspector in the preliminary inquiry and were told that in his opinion such and such a thing ought to be done, in nine cases out of ten that ended the opposition, and the opinion of the Local Government Board Inspector was accepted as being the right one. Where, of course, the matter was one of greater magnitude, then it proceeded by way of Provisional Order. He ventured to say that that was exactly what ought to happen. Where they had very large interests involved, as they inevitably must have in these large town-planning schemes, it was only right and fair that the parties should have the opportunity of appearing before a Committee of their Lordships' House or of the other House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01043">The words to which his noble friend alluded were to his mind the most important of the whole of the section. It provided that where the Board confirmed the Order, it should be as if it were enacted in the Act. He was aware that those words were not absolutely new. They were contained in either the Act of 1390 or 1903, he forgot which, and they were also contained in the Small Holdings Act. But what was the result of those words? If anybody wanted to appeal to a Court of Law on any point whatever and asked a Judge to say whether he had been properly or unjustly treated, the Judge&#x2014;and he appealed to his noble and learned friend, the Lord Chief Justice to confirm him&#x2014;turning to the Act was obliged to say, "Whatever has been done by the Local Government Board is enacted in this Act, and therefore the Court has no jurisdiction. "That was really a very serious position indeed, and he hoped their Lordships would not, in these great town,-planning schemes, depart from the course which had not, he ventured to say, been found wanting hitherto, and that they would decide to maintain in the case before them, though not in the case of the earlier parts of the Bill, the procedure of the Provisional Order, which he ventured to think had given satisfaction to everybody who had ever appealed to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01044"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member> said that as some allusion had been male to the Potteries case, and he was Chairman of the Commission that went into that question,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0148"/>
<col>283</col>
he would like to say a word or two with regard to it. The cost in that case was very heavy, but certainly all the evidence that was laid before them led him to the conclusion that the people concerned would very much rather prefer to bear the cost than be left to the tender mercies of the Local Government Board. The fact of the matter was that the whole of those proceedings really amounted to an appeal to their Lordships' Committee against what was then considered to be the somewhat arbitrary and despotic conduct of the Local Government Board. He did most earnestly hope that their Lordships would make a stand against the constant habit of endeavouring to throw so much on Government Departments. That was a departure which was all part and parcel of the Socialist programme. He wished his noble friends Lord Milner and Lord Curzon had been there, because they had been accused of being autocratic, and he himself also had been accused of the same thing; but, however much they might have been despotic, they could not hope to compete with the President of the Local Government Board in that respect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01045"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I have no desire to waste the time of the Committee over any further discussion of this matter, but I am bound to state the extent to which I share the disappointment expressed by my noble friend at the general reception which our town-planning proposals have met with. I say general reception, because the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, very naturally and properly travelled over practically the entire field of the subject in dealing with his present Amendment. I cannot help feeling that there is a marked, and, I fear, an unbridgeable, difference between ourselves and noble Lords opposite on this matter. That difference in fact consists in this. We are so convinced of the advantages which will come from a general introduction of the town-planning system that we are prepared, thinking we can do so without risk and in order that it may come about, to sacrifice some of those precautions sanctified by time and decorated by a vast expenditure of money which have been applied in so many previous Acts of Parliament. Noble Lords opposite are willing to express a general approval of town-planning as an admirable thing in theory, but they will not move a step aside from the old rut in order to encourage the system. That is the marked difference between us. I unfor-
<col>284</col>
tunately did not hear the opening sentences of the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, but I am given to understand that he expressed some sympathy with town-planning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01046"><member>EARL CAWDOR</member> interposed that he did.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01047"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am bound to say that, in my opinion, and of course it is only a matter of opinion, all the rest of the noble Earl's speech that I was fortunate enough to hear indicated a frame of mind towards the whole question which will make it practically useless to attempt to pass an Act dealing with the matter. These things, as I say, are only matters of opinion. I have looked carefully at the clause which the noble Earl proposes should take the place of our clauses. I can only say that, in my opinion, if that clause is embodied in an Act of Parliament it will attain the fate which has followed so many Acts of Parliament&#x2014;I mean the wastepaper basket. If all these elaborate proceedings have to be gone through before a town-planning scheme can be carried out&#x2014;except in the few cases of very large schemes in which I can quite conceive, because I desire to be fair, they might be applied&#x2014;I do not believe that the provisions of the Act could be made useful. I could not help thinking that the noble Earl imported some unnecessary prejudice into the really bitter attack which he made upon the Public Departments of this country in relation to this particular branch of the subject. I entirely agree with my noble friend behind me that if the noble Earl was going to make that kind of attack he had far better have made it upon the earlier portions of the Bill than upon this one. Those earlier portions do, no doubt, involve certain interferences with property. But at any rate it may be said, I think without fear of contradiction, that this part of the Bill involves infinitely less. What is going to happen here, I take it, under these town-planning schemes, is that the real weight of the scheme will fall upon the local authority and upon the private owners of land in the neighbourhood. It is true that the name of the Department occurs often in these clauses, but so far as this part of the Bill is concerned the actual part which would be played by the Local Government Board will, in my opinion, be comparatively small. The noble Earl talked of the Local Government Board doing this and doing that. What will happen will probably be, so far as we can judge by the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0149"/>
<col>285</col>
best precedents we have&#x2014;namely, the precedents of what takes place under similar Acts in other countries&#x2014;that the whole matter will be run by the local authority.<lb/>
I can only repeat that the fears which have caused these Amendments to be placed on the Paper, if carried into effect in this way, will in my judgment have a serious and most damaging effect on the operations of the Bill. The noble Earl in the Chair spoke up like a man for Provisional Orders. I think it is very right and proper that he should. There is nothing like leather. The noble Earl&#x2014;and I am very grateful to him for his services&#x2014;eats, drinks, and sleeps in the company of Provisional Orders, and I have no doubt he would like to apply them to every transaction in life. But where a scheme of this kind is to come into operation necessarily involving a vast amount of agreement between the different parties, including the local authority, it does seem hard that the obstruction of one or two unreasonable individuals, who are quite indifferent, probably, to the aspect of the town in which they live and do not care whether its outskirts are represented by a garden suburb or a fringe of pig-styes, should seriously interfere and hamper the process of improvement. I am willing to admit that if it was only a question of a great scheme by such a Corporation as Liverpool, or Manchester, or Leeds, the procedure would be rational enough; but I should hope that there will be quite a multiplication of small schemes in relation to the development of small country towns, and it is with regard to those in particular that I dread this elaboration of procedure. I am afraid, my Lords, it is useless to press the point further upon you, but it is one upon which I feel strongly myself, because it is one in which I have taken a personal interest for some time, and what I can only call the luke-warmness of noble Lords opposite towards the principle involved in our proposals has bitterly disappointed me. It leads me to think that it will be very difficult to get the House to agree to any measure of sufficient scope to be of real practical value.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01048"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am quite content to leave this matter where it was left by my noble friend behind me and by the Lord Chairman of Committees. I rise only because I wish to emphasise what has already been said by them. I mean that
<col>286</col>
there is on this side of the House no hostility whatever to the policy of town planning. There is no difference between the two sides of the House with regard to the desirability of that policy, but there is, as the noble Earl told us a few moments ago, a marked difference between the two sides of the House as to the conditions under which these schemes should be undertaken. We are not dealing, as the noble Earl in charge of the Bill endeavoured to induce us to believe, with small and trivial matters; we are dealing with schemes which may be of immense importance&#x2014;schemes which, as my noble friend told the Committee, may be intended to take effect, not in the near future, but in a future which may extend as far as half a century ahead of us. In such cases it is not right, in our opinion, that by-laws should be torn up, that Acts of Parliament should be superseded, that the Courts of Justice should be ignored, and that final and plenary powers should be put into the hands of a Public Department. The procedure which my noble friend desires to substitute for that in the Bill is not, however, a procedure which will in any sense dethrone the Local Government Board from its activity in regard to town-planning schemes. The schemes will still have to be submitted to the Local Government Board; it is still the Local Government Board that will have to hold the inquiries, and it will only be in the rare cases where the persons affected desire that their objections should be thoroughly and sufficiently heard that it will be necessary to put in force the precautions which my noble friend desires to introduce. We are, after all, only insisting upon what, I believe, has been always regarded as a first principle in dealing with these questions&#x2014;the principle that the administrative and judicial functions should not be left in the hands of the same people. Those of us who have had experience of countries where civilisation is not so fully developed as it is here have been accustomed to be told that the combination of judicial and administrative functions in the hands of the same officials is an abuse. We have always felt that it was a combination which was not desirable, and it is defended in such cases because the civilisation of the country is backward and because it is impossible to duplicate the work of your official hierarchy. To say that it is necessary that judicial and administrative functions should be in the hands of the same people in this country, and that it is desirable in such cases as those dealt with under this Bill, seems to me
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0150"/>
<col>287</col>
to be a proposition which we cannot possibly assent to. I shall, therefore, gladly support the Amendment of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

He said he wished to say a word about this Amendment, because he thought it dealt with a point which was not dealt with by the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, in his Amendment. The noble Earl proposed to re-enact the first words of the subsection,</p>

It was obvious that if a scheme was replaced by another scheme the procedure, whatever it might be, used in the original scheme would be repeated again when the new scheme was being put in the place of the old one. The words he proposed to strike out referred to a case where a scheme had been made and was not going to be replaced by another one, but was going to be done away with altogether. He thought that was a case which ought to be brought in some way under the same procedure as that which was necessary for the making

of a new scheme or for substituting another one for the original scheme. It was obvious when they had made a scheme they had done many things upon which the owners of property were dependent. They had laid out a number of roads, they had altered the relative value of many people's property, and to do away with those in a light and insufficient way appeared to him would do very great injustice; and if they were going to do away with the scheme it should be necessary to go through the same procedure and afford the same safeguards as when making a new scheme or substituting another one for it.

he was in their Lordships' hands, but he thought it ought to come out of the Bill. His noble friend Lord Malmesbury, in moving a previous Amendment, had well expressed the enormous objections which he was sure the Committee felt to putting in such wide words as "likely to be used for building," which it was quite impossible for any surveyor, however eminent, much less the Local Government Board, to decide. So far from furthering town-planning schemes the insertion of those words would only tend to make them much more difficult and raise opposition wherever the schemes were brought forward.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01063"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>thought his noble friend would see that in consequence of the very important Amendment carried on the motion of his noble friend Lord Cawdor, there was no longer the same necessity to limit land which was the subject-matter of these schemes as there was before. Now everything would be subject to the ultimate control of Parliament, if there was any question raised; and with that precaution he did not think it would be wrong that part of the land which was the subject-matter of these schemes should be such as could be used for private open spaces, roads, streets, parks, and other matters, which went to make up a building scheme. Therefore he thought the early words of the subsection ought to remain in. But when they came to the last three lines of the subsection, which Viscount Hill proposed to leave out, he held a different opinion. Those words seemed to him to be unnecessary now, and ought to come out. The decision was to be a decision of the Local Government

Board no longer, and therefore the three last lines ought not to be there. The final Court of appeal was to be Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01064"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked whether it did not a little depend on what the meaning of the very vague words "land likely to be used for building" implied, because it seemed to him a little hard that, because their land might be likely to be used for building twenty years hence, they were to be put to all the expense of a Provisional Order. He saw no objection to leaving the subsection in if those words were limited in some way, but otherwise they were very vague. There was no land near big or growing towns at the present day that was unlikely to be used for building at some time or other.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01065"><member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY</member> said they had already passed in the earlier part of the section the words "land likely to be used for building purposes." That was in subsection (1), and he took it that the Amendments before them were really consequential to bring the language of the section in the same form throughout. Surely, when the Committee had already passed the words in subsection (1), they ought not to begin to meddle with them in subsection (7).</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01066"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> said he would not press his Amendment, but reserved the liberty to bring it up again if necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01067"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Lord withdraws his Amendment, may I say that unless these words, or some similar words, are in, it would be impossible to proceed with the Bill. In any town-planning scheme there must be land included which is not necessarily in course of development. If you are only going to town plan land which is in course of development your town plan disappears altogether, and I should not propose, in those circumstances, to proceed with this part of the Bill at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01068"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> said the Government had more or less conceded the point that these words "or appears likely to be used" were somewhat ambiguous, and he took it that noble Lords on his side of the House had more or less conceded the point that some such words were necessary. He did not know
<col>292</col>
whether the Government could tell them whether they were prepared to limit the words in some way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01069"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that if the words in the third line of Clause 54, "which is in course of development or appears likely to be used," were still in the Bill, then the noble Lord proposed to define what those words meant. His Amendment, therefore, was perfectly pertinent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01070"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> said he did not press the Amendment. He quite saw what the noble Earl the Leader of the House meant when he said that in any town-planning scheme there must be included lands not necessarily at the moment in course of development. He would have been ready to move, "land required in order to further such development." The words he strongly objected to were the words "or appears likely to be." However, he did not wish to take up the time of the Committee, and would not press his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01084"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said their Lordships had shown so much hostility to the plan proposed by His Majesty's Government that it really was with some diffidence that he rose to defend that portion of their proposals; but the point, as their Lordships would see, was a substantial one. Statutory enactments included first of all public Acts, and also local cts. With regard to public Acts, there was already, he thought, in a subsequent clause a provision that when any statutory enactment in a public Act was involved there should be a
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0154"/>
<col>295</col>
Provisional Order, and there was a provision that it had to lie for thirty days on the Table. With regard to local Acts, there were local Acts which had the effect of statutory enactments, and therefore they would come under the Amendment moved by the noble Earl below the gangway. These local Acts contained a number of very small matters with which the Local Government Board thought it was not unreasonable they should be allowed to deal. A great many of the provisions which occurred in local Acts were really obsolete, and had been replaced in many districts by by-laws; and without this provision, it would be impossible for the local authority to assist the various bodies which were anxious to bring in town-planning schemes. A great many of the provisions contained in local Acts would stereotype streets and buildings, and that was one of the things which in many cases a town-planning scheme would like to avoid. The power of altering local Acts was one which, under Section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1888, county councils might exercise uncontrolled except by the Board; and though he was afraid Lord Belper would hardly put the Local Government Board on so high a pedestal as the county councils, still he thought if this power were given to county councils, with the supervision of the Local Government Board, it was not a very extreme step to ask their Lordships to give the power also to the Local Government Board. There were precedents, both with regard to local Acts and public Acts, for giving the Board power to make modifications when necessary&#x2014;under the Education Act, 1902, Schedule II, Section 19, and also under Schedule III, Section 12. In both those cases there was this power; and also in regard to the Unemployed Workmen's Act the Board were authorised to apply various provisions. In view of those precedents, he hoped their Lordships would not think the provision unreasonable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01085"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said the noble Earl had assumed that he (Lord Belper) placed the Local Government Board in a very inferior position to county councils. All he had ever contended was that the Local Government Board should keep its own position, and do its own work, and not interfere and try and limit the powers of local government. He did not wish to pursue that, but he thought the taunt a
<col>296</col>
quite unworthy one, because he had never for a moment suggested that the Local Government Board should not have full power for supervising.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01087"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> pointed out that the words in question could not possibly stand having regard to the decision on the noble Earl's (Lord Cawdor's) clause. It was proposed that there still might be a power to vary statutory enactments. If their Lordships would look at subsection (5) of Earl Cawdor's new clause which the Committee had just inserted, they would see it there provided that if the scheme contained a provision suspending any statutory enactment the Order should not be of any validity unless and until it had been confirmed by Parliament. Therefore, the words could not stand in the fact of the clause already passed. But he rose to enter a very modest, and he hoped not a useless, protest with regard to the distinction drawn between public and private Acts of Parliament. He did not understand why, when a locality had gone to Parliament and had its special case considered and a statutory bargain had been made, it should be suggested that the local Act should be less sacred than a public Act. In the Courts they had always considered&#x2014;he supposed they would be wrong now&#x2014;that private Acts conferred by Parliament might override a public general Act. It seemed to him that the noble Earl really ought not to have suggested that an Act simply because it was a private Act was less to be respected than a public Act. However, the words proposed to be omitted by Lord Clifford could not possibly stand in face of the clause that had already been added to the Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01114"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he had put down an Amendment to Clause 57, but before he proposed it he would be glad to hear what His
<col>300</col>
Majesty's Government had to say to explain the terms of this clause. The clause proposed to give power to the responsible authority to do several things, and in paragraph (<i>b</i>) it proposed to give power to execute any work which it was the duty of any person to execute under the scheme. He was not quite sure, even after the interesting speech from the noble Earl in charge of the Bill in reply to his noble friend, Lord Cawdor, what were the kind of works it was proposed should be compulsorily executed under the terms of the Bill. The noble Earl spoke of the whole terms of this town-planning arrangement as of the most modest and quiet character, which were to be carried out, in his belief, on voluntary lines, but what was slightly inconsistent with the noble Earl's attitude was the fact that coercive clauses of the most drastic character were enumerated in the Bill, and this was one of them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01115">What was the kind of works which the clause would include? They were not defined. There was no enacting clause. The local authority would be able, it seemed, to execute any kind of work and demand repayment from the person they deemed to be in default. But the work might be unprofitable to that person, and, indeed, might do him harm. He could not help thinking that was a very drastic provision; and, as far as the terms of the clause were concerned, it would be immoral. It was true that by the next clause any injury done to a man's property had to be compensated for, but that was not the point here. The point here was that certain works were to be executed, and the actual out-of-pocket expenses of those works might be recovered from the person whose duty it was to carry them out. They did not know who that person might be, but it appeared on the face of it that if the particular works did not do that property any good, and were of no pecuniary advantage in money or kind, the person had still to pay for them. He thought that in the drafting of this clause something had been left out. The clause ought to indicate the species of work intended and that the work was to be to the benefit of the person charged. Then, and then only, should he be called on to pay for it. They had to remedy that injustice. He had put down words, but he was afraid he must admit that his words did not appear to him to be perfect; and therefore he would not press them if His Majesty's Government would give the

necessary information. He hoped the noble Earl appreciated the point, and would meet it in some way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01116"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The point, I think, is that the power under this clause would arise after a scheme had been made and when all the considerations to which the noble Marquess referred would have been threshed out. I take it that the kind of work a man might be called upon to execute, and where, if he did not execute it, the scheme would be applied, would arise in cases of this kind. Supposing the noble Marquess and myself had some land intercepted by the area covered by the scheme, and the scheme provided that a certain circular road for developing building land should be made. The scheme being passed, the noble Marquess, we will presume, declines to execute his part of the work of road-making and sewering which is necessary to carry out the scheme as approved. Until it is done the scheme cannot be proceeded with, and my land is made useless. It would be no use my making my part of the road if the noble Marquess would not make his; and the scheme being passed and approved, the authority could call upon the noble Marquess to make his part of the road, and if he would not, they would do it for him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01117"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he could quite understand that if the scheme were to be profitable to the noble Earl's part of the property the noble Earl would be glad to see coercion put upon him to do something without which it would be useless. But surely it would not be fair to throw the expense of making a circular road upon him for the benefit of the noble Earl. The noble Earl said that would be threshed out before the scheme was made. He agreed, and he felt that now that their Lordships had inserted the Amendment of his noble friend Earl Cawdor, he would be able to come to their Lordships' House or to the other House of Parliament in order to obtain justice when the scheme was under consideration. He thought there ought to be on the face of the Bill some words to indicate that the work to be charged to a person was to be in some way to his benefit. Surely he ought not to be charged with work for the benefit of the public at large. However, if the noble Earl would say that between this and Report he would consider the introduction
<col>302</col>
of some Amendment he would not proceed with his own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01118"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I will consider the matter in the light of what has been said by the noble Marquess. To continue the apologue, if his land suffers the noble Marquess is entitled to compensation. The only question, I suppose, that might arise would be whether the degree of advantage to be gained by the operation of the scheme would be equivalent to the work the noble Marquess would have to do. But unless some power of this kind exists the whole scheme may fail through the refusal of somebody who has a piece of land in the centre to do anything. It may be a good reason for having no scheme if this gentleman objects so much to having anything done on his land; but once you have a scheme you cannot give him the power of indefinitely refusing to do anything.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01119"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said this might refer to road making and the construction of sewers. It was always the duty of the owner to provide, first of all, in any development scheme, roads and sewers, and it might be said that it was so absolutely necessary to be done, that if it were not done it would delay the whole scheme. If His Majesty's Government between now and the Report stage would put in words to make the point clear it would be well.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01120"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> pointed out, with reference to the statement of the noble Earl the Leader of the House that a person who was damaged would be entitled to compensation, that Clause 58 provided that a person should not be entitled to claim compensation under that section on account of any building erected on or contract made or other thing done with respect to land included in a scheme, after the time at which the application for authority to prepare the scheme was made. This affected the point raised by Lord Salisbury&#x2014;namely, that the owner might suffer damage or loss long after the scheme had been made and put into operation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01121"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The point the noble Duke has raised is a different one. It may be argued whether compensation ought to be paid in one lump sum when the scheme is prepared, which is the pro-

position in the Bill, or whether the person injured ought to be able to claim it at any time. But that is a different point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01122"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said the noble Earl did not follow the noble Duke. It had to be arranged before the scheme was taken in hand. If the clause were limited in this way it could not apply to the time at which the scheme was being carried into effect. The person complaining would be told: "You should have appealed before the scheme was put into operation; you should have appealed before even the application was finally sanctioned; now you come and complain that the cost of this road is too great. It is too late; you should have done this before." So that he would be debarred under the terms of Clause 58 from getting his remedy for a wrong done under Clause 57.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01123"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: What would happen, according to my view of the case, is this. While the scheme was in preparation, the owner who is presumed to be injured would say, "I have such and such a piece of land, and you ask me by this scheme to make a road; it will not pay me to do it; I shall positively lose by it; therefore I must have a lump sum for compensation." It is true it is an arguable proposition whether, instead of a claim for injury being sent in and paid at a later stage, it should be paid before the work was done. But everything that is going to happen is in the scheme, and it is for the owner, while the scheme is under preparation, to say, in vulgar parlance, "Where do I come in? This scheme, far from enabling me to cover my land with houses, is going to take half of it for an open space, and for two roads. This building land is not going to bring anything in to me." That may be good reasoning. But nothing can happen during the progress of the scheme, except what is in the scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01124"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he was obliged to the noble Earl for trying to make it clear. As the noble Earl would look into the matter he would not go further with it then, and would not move his first Amendment. But he had another Amendment on the Paper providing that if any question arose whether a building or work contravened a town-planning scheme, "the matter may be referred for decision to the County Court of the district in the
<col>304</col>
same manner and subject to the like provisions as an appeal to that Court under Part I of this Act." This Amendment replaced appeals to the Local Government Board in this clause by appeals to a County Court Judge, and as he had induced their Lordships to adopt a similar Amendment in the earlier part of the Bill he hoped there would be no necessity to repeat the arguments he then used. But there was a conversation the previous night on the Amendment of his noble friend Lord Belper, in which it was suggested that there ought to be an appeal on a point of law, under certain restrictions, to the High Court. In the course of that conversation it was clearly brought out that in the opinion of most of their Lordships there was no necessity for two legal tribunals to sit on cases of this kind, and that, inasmuch as they had inserted the County Court jurisdiction, it was not necessary to press for High Court jurisdiction. But he thought that if he did not put in a word of caution it might, perhaps, be assumed that he, and those acting with him, and his noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, looked on the two propositions as alternatives. That was very far from being the case. The County Court jurisdiction was a jurisdiction both of law and fact, and it was a jurisdiction available for the immediate use of those who felt themselves aggrieved by the action of the local authority. To replace that by an appeal upon a point of law to the High Court, or to restore the Local Government Board as the appellate tribunal on questions of fact, would be to effect precisely that evil against which their Lordships had protested during those discussions. They felt very strongly, the objection of allowing a Government Department to be the appellate tribunal for those who felt themselves aggrieved in matters of this kind. He had received a very strong representation from the Council of the Surveyors' Institute in favour of some such change as he had proposed. Their Lordships might not be aware of how important a body this was; so important was it that it was one of the constituent bodies which went to form the great tribunal of appeal under the London Building Act. It was entrusted by the Government with that important function, and this Institute had protested against allowing the Local Government Board to be the appellate tribunal in matters of this

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01140"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he would like to know the effect of the Amendment. The point the noble Earl apparently intended to effect by the Amendment was that any damage to an owner's property which was caused at the time of making a scheme was to be compensated for, but that any damage caused by the carrying out of the scheme was not to be compensated for.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01141"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said they were drifting into a discussion on the Amendment of the noble Marquess in the next line. He thought it would be better to take the two matters together; they were quite inter-dependent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01142"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> then moved an Amendment providing that any person whose property was injuriously affected by the operation of a town-planning scheme should, if he made a claim for the purpose "within three
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0160"/>
<col>307</col>
months of the time when such injury is done," be entitled to compensation from the responsible authority. He said the matter did not require to be stated at length. As the Bill stood the owner was called upon to enter his claim for compensation, not when the damage took place, but within a few months after the scheme was fixed. That, of course, he had considerable objection to. It was quite clear that, with the rather extensive views of the President of the Local Government Board as to schemes that might last over a period of half-a-century, it would be rather unreasonable for a landowner at the beginning of the half century to say what damage would be done to his property during the carrying out of the scheme extending over the fifty years. Therefore he proposed to insert a very reasonable Amendment to the effect that the owner's claim for compensation might be adjudged, not when the scheme was settled, but when the damage took place, or within three months of the time when the damage took place. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill had indicated that they might deal with damage which had accrued from the "making" of the scheme. No doubt the suggestion of the Government to substitute the word "making" for "operation" would meet part of his objection but not the whole, because the only claim for compensation was in respect of damage done by making the scheme instead of by the operation of the scheme. The Government might, perhaps, be prepared to amend the Bill in that particular; but they could not get out of the difficulty by changing the word "operation" into the word "making." It was true that by the change they made his Amendment unnecessary at the time, but it became necessary for the purpose of a subsequent time.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01144"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the idea of the Government was that the extent of the damage to a property should be measured by the difference in value after the making of the scheme as compared with the value before. That, he thought, was quite intelligible, and that was why they thought the Amendment unnecessary. The noble Marquess wished to safeguard the owner
<col>308</col>
from damage accruing to the property perhaps half a century afterwards; but would it be of any advantage to the estate suppose there was damage fifty years later if these words were inserted? He really could not understand why the noble Marquess thought three months would be sufficient to meet the case.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01146"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought that if the noble Marquess meant three months subsequent to damage which might be caused half a century after the scheme was made, he there showed the poverty of his contention. If he said compensation was to to be paid at the moment when the estate was injured, he left the door open to a sphere of litigation which could not be contemplated. If the property were to be put up for auction every one interested in the matter would be able to measure the difference in value.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01147"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member> was afraid the noble Earl did not quite appreciate the point. If the scheme were going on for fifty years it was quite possible that damage might be done to a portion of the property which it was absolutely impossible to contemplate when the scheme was made. In that case it was proper that compensation should be given.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01148"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> thought the view of the Government was right. This was a question with which he had been called upon to deal hundreds of times. It was perfectly true that they might have a system whereby from time to time there would spring up claims to compensate for damage caused in consequence of the operation of the scheme. There would be endless inquiries and the plan would be open to very serious objections. It was a difficult problem, but came in the same range as that relating to the construction of a railway, dock, or some other public work. In those cases the damage might not accrue within the next few years. The work might very seriously affect the estate of an adjoining owner in the utility of purpose to which it was put and that damage must be as essed once and for all. The only logical way of dealing with the matter was to say that the scheme was made when it had stereotyped the character of the property of the adjoining owner for all
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0161"/>
<col>309</col>
time, and then the people having to deal with the question would have to say whether the property was injuriously affected. He certainly thought the view of the Government was right, and that there must be an assessment once and for all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01149"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> inquired whether the injury for which compensation was to be given was to be based upon the selling value of the land in consequence of making the scheme.

The Amendment raised a technical point and affected the question of betterment which perhaps did not excite a great amount of interest in that House. He, however, did not propose to move the Amendment especially as the matter to which he wished to call attention was covered by the next Amendment which stood in the name of the Marquess of Salisbury.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01166"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved an Amendment restricting the amount which the responsible authority would be entitled to recover from owners of property increased in value by the operation of a town-planning scheme to the amount of the authority's expenditure under the scheme which might be fairly apportioned as having been expended directly to the advantage of that property. He confessed that he approached the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0162"/>
<col>311</col>
subject with considerable diffidence because it raised the question of how to calculate betterment. He knew that the clause as it stood would be defended by the Government, and he did not feel satisfied that the words proposed by his Amendment were entirely defensible. In the first place, according to the wording of the Bill, when under a town-planning scheme property increased in value the whole of that value was to go to the local authority who were responsible for the scheme. His first criticism upon that proposal was that where the local authority had been put to a certain expense in carrying out the scheme they were entitled to the full results of it. But that was not the fact, for the expenditure in the ordinary case would fall, not upon the authority, but probably upon the other owners, and it might also fall upon the owner of the land in question. Whether it fell upon the owner of that land or the adjoining owners it was difficult to see why, the owners having been put to certain expense, the local authority should reap the whole results. But he did not base his opposition to the clause as it stood merely on that ground.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01167">Was it really the fact that when, as the result of a town-planning scheme, property increased in value, the whole of that increase ought to go to the local authority, even if all the expense had been defrayed by the authority? He submitted that that was an absolutely extravagant proposition. Take a piece of property on the coast, where the land might be developed as a watering place, but no action could be taken at present because there was no access to the property. The owner might have 500 acres of land but be without the necessary capital to make it accessible, and consequently he would be unable to develop the property in the manner described. The local authority might have their attention called to it, and if they were a business like set of men and a public spirited authority they would wish to develop the property and thus increase the ratable value. They would determine upon a town-planning scheme, part of which would consist in laying out a large main road. The effect of that might be to increase the value of the property from &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;500 per acre. Did the Government really mean to enact that as the result of making this road, which might cost &#x00A3;500 at the outside, the whole of the
<col>312</col>
increased value of the property suitable for a seaside watering place should go to the local authority and that they should receive &#x00A3;400 per acre from that property? If that was what the Bill enacted the proposition was manifestly absurd. The local authority was certainly entitled to something, but surely not to the whole of the increased value. By far the larger part of the increase belonged to the owner, who, by good judgment or, it might be, good luck, had become possessed of a valuable site. It would be most inequitable to rob him of the whole increased value because the town-planning scheme had been carried out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01168">Then came the question, To what was the local authority entitled? The Amendment limited it to the amount of expense to which they had been put, and that, he thought, was a very clear proposition. He did not know whether the Government were prepared to accept it; if they were he had nothing more to advance; but if not, and they were of opinion that there was something more due to the authority than merely their out-of-pocket expenses, he would ask them to state the further amount they considered would be due. If the Government would meet him in a satisfactory manner he would not press the Amendment, but otherwise he would endeavour to construct an equitable division of value other than that provided by the Bill.</p>

The noble Marquess mentioned the case of property at the seaside worth &#x00A3;100 per acre for agricultural purposes, but which, by simply making a road leading to it, became worth &#x00A3;500 per acre.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01174"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is, of course, a simple case, but the more ordinary operation would be for the two owners to come together for the purpose of the scheme. The noble Lord thinks our words go too far, but it is really the degree of betterment which is actually due to the making of the scheme. I do not see that that degree of betterment could approach the large figure mentioned by the noble Marquess. It is easy to put forward an instance in which the whole of such a large increase could be supposed to be due to the actual scheme, but we are perfectly prepared to consider facts, and possibly to modify the words of the subsection to see whether the particular instance which the noble Marquess mentioned can be met. He proposed to put in the words&#x2014;
<quote>"The amount of the expenditure by the local authority under the town-planning scheme which may be fairly apportioned as having been expended directly to the advantage of the property."</quote>
There may be expenditure made by a local authority which, though not directly to its advantage, may indirectly raise the value of the property to a very large extent. It is not quite easy to see how the Amendment would work. Suppose the road which the noble Marquess proposed to have made to his seaside estate cost &#x00A3;3,000, &#x00A3;4,000 or even &#x00A3;5,000&#x2014;and a main road fifty or sixty feet wide would not have to be a very great length to cost that
<col>314</col>
&#x2014;and suppose that instead of the large estate which he imagined to exist, there was quite a small estate, the value of which might be increased from &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;400 or &#x00A3;500 owing to the making of the road. According to the noble Marquess's Amendment the whole sum expended on the road would be expended to the advantage of this small property.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01175"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said it was quite clear that in the case put by the noble Earl no one would build a road at a cost of &#x00A3;3,000 if he were only going to effect so small a benefit as that described. The road would evidently be for other purposes, and other people would have to contribute to the expenditure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01176"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think the last argument is met by the fact that although the immediate benefit from the scheme might be extremely small, it might at the moment of making the scheme be confined to a comparatively small area; and it is possible that the immediate benefit might not equal the cost of the first transaction, although in the future there might be a very great increase. In those circumstances the piece of property might be made liable for even more than it is worth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01177"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think I am right in inferring from the noble Earl's remarks that he quite admits that my noble friend has raised a point which requires very careful consideration. It is an extremely difficult point. The case, I understand, is something of this kind. The owner has a property with a dormant value, and that dormant value, owing to the operation of a scheme promoted by a responsible local authority, becomes converted into a very much increased present value. Under the Bill as it stands we take it that the whole of this increased value would pass to the local authority. Our contention is that in a case of that kind the owner of the property is entitled to a reasonable share. It seems very difficult to lay down formally how that share should be determined. It is obvious that there may be some cases where the portion contributed by the owner relatively to the sum contributed by the local authority may be larger, or may be smaller, and we want to arrive at some means of bringing about an equitable apportionment of the increased value between the

two parties. It may be possible for the noble Earl to reserve the point, and to make some attempt to provide machinery&#x2014;by arbitration or otherwise&#x2014;for distributing the betterment between the claimants. Let me say, in passing, that my distaste for the word "betterment" is only equalled by my dislike for "worsement." The apportionment would depend upon the expenditure by the responsible authority on the one side and the share contributed by the owner on the other. If the noble Earl will undertake to consider the question from that point of view we shall be quite willing to let the matter stand over.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01179"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> thought that as the responsible authority would gain very largely by the conversion of land value from &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;500 per acre in that the rateable value would be largely increased, it was unfair for them to claim the whole of the increased value.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01180"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> thought the crux of the contention lay in having to pay upon the whole of the increased value. The original idea of betterment was a rating, or, at all events, a taxing question, and if it were established that the increased value was placed upon the property, the owner would have to pay the rate on the increased value, although not in a lump sum. The matter had been dealt with by private Acts of Parliament, in which it was laid down what fixed percentage was to be paid on the increased value. In this case the local authority made matters sure by taxing the whole thing in a lump sum. He need hardly point out that nothing had been done to meet his objection that the thing would be almost impracticable. Assuming that the property doubled in value, how was the money to be raised if the owner had no other means of producing it?</p>

as proposed. by the clause. He contended that there was no reason to alter the course pursued in other cases of reference to single arbitrator. He was aware that the answer of the Government would be that great economy would be effected by going to the Local Government Board, and they would be told that the Board was not only an impartial body but was perfectly competent for the task. He, however, doubted extremely whether the Local Government Board's inspectors were as competent as other arbitrators to decide difficult question of this kind. Some of these cases might involve very large and important questions There appeared to be a tendency on the part of noble Lords opposite to minimise the importance of these town-planning schemes, but that was not quite compatible with the great importance they appeared to attach to that portion of the Bill. He did not believe they would be very small and he hoped many of them would prove to be of considerable importance. It was therefore, extremely desirable that the usual custom of appointing an arbitrator should be observed. He quite saw the objection to appointing an arbitrator under the land clause provision, but that did not arise in the present instance.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01185"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought there was no necessity to reply to the noble Duke' comments regarding the Local Government Board. He would direct attention to Clause 62, which provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"Where the Local Government Board are authorised by this Part of the Act or any scheme made thereunder to determine any matter, it shall be at their option to determine the matter as arbitrators or otherwise, and if they elect to determine the matter as arbitrators, the provisions of the Regulation of Railways Act, 1868, respecting arbitrations by the Board of Trade, and the enactment amending those provisions, shall apply as if the were here re-enacted and in terms made applicable to the Local Government Board and the determination of the matters aforesaid:</quote>
<quote>Provided that where the question to be determined is a question whether property is injuriously affected or increased in value, or as to the amount or manner of payment of the sum which is to be paid as compensation or which the responsible authority are entitled to recover from the person whose property is increased in value, the Local Government Board shall not determine the question otherwise than as arbitrators except with the consent of the parties interested."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0165"/>
<col>317</col>
The result of the Act referred to had been that the Board had usually appointed a single arbitrator to settle a matter. The second part of the clause provided that where the question to be determined was one of those to which the Amendment applied then the Board should not determine otherwise than as arbitrator except with the consent of the parties interested. That cleared away the objection of the noble Duke.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01186"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> said he had an Amendment on the Paper on similar lines. He was quite willing to consent to there being only one arbitrator, but what struck him were the words, The determination of the Board shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons." They wanted to see that there was careful protection for every individual. Whatever Clause 62 might mean they had heard it proposed that the determination of the Local Government Board should be final and conclusive, and it seemed to him that that overruled a good many points.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01187"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said he also had an Amendment down which had not overlooked Clause 62. The reason for the Amendment was that of all the cases in the Bill where the decision rested with the Local Government Board this was the worst, because town-planning schemes were to be inspected by the Local Government Board, approved by the Board, and forced by them, quite properly, on the local authority. How it could fairly be said that when the Board had selected a scheme and approved it they were the right persons to say the amount to which a man's property was injuriously affected passed his comprehension. If, however, the noble Earl in charge of the Bill meant that it was to be referred to an arbitrator who was not a Local Government Board arbitrator he was quite satisfied.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01188"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that if the noble and learned Lord were not satisfied, after further consideration of Clause 62, the matter might very well stand over until Report.</p>

That seemed to him a very extraordinary expression, because the by-laws, of course, were the bylaws which were in force, and the local authority had to put them in force so far as it saw fit. But how could anybody tell what could "reasonably" have been inserted in the by-laws? He did not wish to go against the clause further than was necessary to attach some clear meaning to it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01215"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member> moved to leave out subsection (2), which, he said, was a somewhat astounding one, and which was introduced during Committee in another place by the President of the Local Government Board. He believed he was right in saying that the clause was passed under the Closure resolution without any discussion whatever, notwithstanding the very important details which it contained. He hoped the noble Earl in charge of the Bill would be able to explain some of the reasons the Government might have in their mind for introducing a clause containing this extraordinary and very novel proposal. Under this clause a man was told, "Yes, we tolerate your possession of the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0167"/>
<col>321</col>
land, but you must develop it exactly as we wish you to." He ventured to think that that would make a landlord hesitate very hard about developing his land at all. There were other restrictions, and he believed the result would be that a landlord would find his land absolutely unsaleable. That would place him in the very happy position of having to pay an undeveloped land tax of a halfpenny in the &#x00A3;1. He would add the further objection, that by such restrictive covenants the cost of developing the land per house was enormously increased. If there were ten houses and a road cost &#x00A3;1,000, it stood to reason that the rent of those houses must be enormously increased in order to repay the landowner. Another very serious aspect of the clause was that it introduced something totally different from what he understood were the principles of the Bill. If land was developed with so many acres attached to each house and a subsequent town-planning scheme were brought in, it seemed to him that the former scheme was of no use at all. He hoped they would be able to elicit from the Government some definite statement as to the object of the clause. The clause had not been discussed in another place, and it would seem somewhat difficult to support it; in fact, for his own part he thought the only thing to do was to reject it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01217"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the noble Earl spoke of eliciting information from the Government as if it had been a difficult process in the course of the discussions. He, personally, felt he had trespassed so much upon their Lordships' time that he regarded the noble Earl's remarks as, on the whole, rather a compliment. In Clause 59 they included certain circumstances in which they did not think compensation should be paid. It was not their opinion that it was really practicable to pay compensation if the space about the buildings, the number of the buildings to be erected, or the height and character of the buildings were of a character perhaps somewhat better than would be carried out by the owner if there had not been a town-planning scheme. The whole object of the town-planning scheme was to encourage the building of a better class of houses, and it was unreasonable to expect that compensation should
<col>322</col>
be paid if an obligation were laid upon the owner to improve the character of his property and to build a better class of houses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01218"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> hoped the noble Earl would not press the Amendment. The whole matter of town-planning was really an interference in the public interest with the present rights of the private owner. All the provisions in the second subsection were clearly intended in the public interest. It might be to some extent a loss to the owner if he were obliged to erect houses of a certain type and a certain distance from one another. He could not build so many small tenements as he could do under the existing law. That, however, would be to the advantage of the public, and he thought it would be hard that the owner should be compensated in such a case from the rates.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01220"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>, in moving the omission of the third subsection, said the subsection seemed to be rather peculiar. It provided that where provisions regulating streets and buildings were in force in one part of an area and not in another part, or different provisions regulating such matters were in force in different parts of that area, a person whose property was affected by the scheme should not be entitled to any greater compensation than he would have been entitled to if the most stringent of the provisions had been in force throughout the area. Surely that was a very extreme proposal. For instance, let them take the case of a scheme which took land which was within the area of a town, and also land which was outside that area. According to this they would assume that the most stringent regulations which were enforced within the town were to be applied to the land which was outside the town and which had been under regulations of quite a different character and much less stringent. Surely that was not what the Government intended. He would like them to state really what they meant by this subsection and what their intention was.</p>

<col>323</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01222"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought the intention of the subsection was fairly clear. Supposing that in a large area which came into one town-planning scheme there were different sets of by-laws prevailing, the object was that no compensation should apply with regard to the worst class of houses within the whole area. The subsection really tried to secure uniformity of treatment, because, supposing there was one man who had houses in different parts of the area he would get compensation perhaps for one part and not for the other, and to some extent by omitting this subsection they would penalise the owner of good houses because they would be compensating the man who owned the bad houses, or those in the least sanitary condition, and who did not comply with the higher standard of by-laws. Their Lordships would see that if there were to be a large number of town-planning schemes it was necessary that no burden of compensation should be put on the various areas. It was thought, and he believed rightly, that this was not a case in which compensation should be paid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01223"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> did not see that it would penalise the owner of good houses at all if the owner of bad houses in another part of the area received compensation, but he did see that it very seriously penalised the owner of less good houses who was now to be judged by the criterion of regulations which prevailed in another area and an area in which he had not lived. That seemed to him to be a hardship.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01224"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> did not really think the Government could adhere to this subsection because, as the noble Earl had said, it would give the man who lived under less stringent by-laws an advantage. That was only true up to a certain point, because under the first subsection the Government had taken power to keep compensation down to the potential by-laws as well as the actual ones; therefore, to a large extent, that was covered. But if there were a substantial difference in the by-laws proposed, no doubt for good reasons, then it did not seem to him that it could be ignored when they came to the question of compensation.

It was very desirable, he thought, that the local authority in that area should buy the pleasure ground and maintain it afterwards. The noble Viscount would see, perhaps, that included in this scheme might be a village near a town, and the village should be able, although not the responsible authority, to buy land for a recreation ground; and unless this subsection was left in that local authority would not be able to buy the recreation ground but it would have to be done by the responsible authority.</p>

With regard to paragraph (<i>d</i>), he would point out that primarily any expenses incurred under the scheme which were not recoverable from the landowners in the manner already agreed to by their Lordships would fall upon the local authority, and the scheme itself might deal with the matters referred to in this paragraph.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01267"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> asked the noble Earl in charge of the Bill what interpretation he put upon the word "execute" in subsection (2) of this clause. The scheme would, of course, provide for laying out certain areas with roads, for constructing sewers, and for allocating certain portions of the area for houses of a certain kind, and so on; but what did the word "execute" mean? It would naturally fall within the province of the local authority to make the roads and provide the sewers, lighting, and so forth, in the exercise of their ordinary functions, but would the word include the building of houses? If so, it would be a very serious matter indeed, and he really did not understand what expenditure was intended to be imposed n the local authorities with regard to these town-planning schemes. There was nothing in the Bill, so far as he was aware, to limit the expenditure to the duties ordinarily performed by local authorities in the way of providing for roads, sewers, and lighting. Under the provisions of the Bill he thought they might build all the houses and impose a very large burden on the ratepayers. It would be a serious matter if the Local Government Board should be able to order a local authority to do work of that kind. He should not have the least objection, of course, to the Local Government Board having the right to order the local authority to make and publish the scheme to be carried out by the owners of property, as was, he thought, primarily intended in the Bill; but what he wished to ask the Government was what limits there were to the expenditure and for what purposes the expenditure might be made.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01268"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought their Lordships had somewhat discussed this question on previous Amendments, and he had already stated that the primary idea certainly was that the local authority in
<col>330</col>
these cases should confine themselves to the making of roads and sewers and to the planting of trees. He did not think anybody would object to that and to similar measures, while it should be left to other bodies to build the houses and carry out the somewhat expensive matters to which the noble Viscount had referred. But might he point out that they had come to a date somewhat late, so to speak, in the scheme. The scheme would have to be approved under the elaborate system inaugurated by noble Lords opposite, and only after the very elaborate regulations made by noble Lords had been observed. If after all this carefully-regulated procedure had been gone through the responsible authority failed to do their part, then the Board might order them to do it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01270"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he should not like to pledge himself as to whether they would be ordered to build houses or not. As he read the clause they would simply be obliged to execute that part of the scheme to which they had pledged themselves in the first place, and he thought noble Lords opposite had already satisfied themselves by the Amendments they had made that the scheme should not be too extravagant or impose a very heavy burden on the rates.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01271"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said he really did not know, and he did not think the noble Earl's answer made it at all clear, whether it was the intention of the Local Government Board, if a local authority, after a scheme had been promulgated and confirmed, was quite prepared to make the roads, sewers, and so forth, but absolutely declined to build the houses, that the authority should be compelled to build the houses. He hoped some kind of answer would be given to that question.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01278"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> moved an Amendment exempting from the operation of the clause the London County Council and the council of any county borough. He said the Amendment was similar to that which their Lordship adopted with regard to Clause 10. He imagined that in any case no difficulty would have been made about the insertion of the clause as a modification of a town-planning scheme; but since the modification which Lord Cawdor carried earlier in the evening, he thought the position would be almost ridiculous if this Amendment were not made, because they might have Birmingham or Manchester undesirous of preparing a town-planning scheme. What he gathered from the Bill as it stood at present was that the Local Government Board could order them to prepare and adopt a scheme and force them to go to Parliament for a Provisional Order, and then the municipality would appear before Parliament to object to its own Provisional Order and show cause why the Provisional Order which it was compelled to adopt should not be made law. He thought it would be practically impossible. From another point of view, he submitted that where the power of the Local Government Board was required was not in forcing
<col>332</col>
a very big local authority to prepare a scheme which it did not desire to prepare; it was required to come in in the case of rapidly developing localities such as seaside places or where factories had been developing and to prevent the sort of confusion which arose in those places. It was difficult to believe that the Government could have intended to apply the Bill to the larger municipalities. Particularly was that the case with regard to London, where at this moment they were staggering under a loan of nearly five millions, which had to be taken up for the Kingsway and Holborn improvement. Now it appeared that the London County Council might be forced to go in for a large scheme and incur another heavy burden of expense in some other locality. That fact should induce their Lordships to accept the new subsection.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01298"><member>LORD BELPER</member> moved to leave out subsection (2). He was quite aware, he said, that this Amendment was not anything like so important as a great many of the Amendments which had occupied the time of their Lordships during a great part of the evening, but at the same time it was of considerable interest to those who had to perform the duty of administering local government. He hoped to be able to show conclusively that the proposal in the Bill was without precedent, that it was contrary to the whole principles of local government, that it was wholly unnecessary as far as the provisions of the Bill were concerned, and that if it were enforced it might interfere very largely with the county councils carrying out their duty in an efficient manner.</p>
<col>334</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01299">With regard to the question of precedent he did not think there was any case of direct interference of this sort on the part of a Government Department. The only cases where there was interference at all related to matters in respect of which the Government contributed a very considerable part of the expense of local government. Let them take the case of education. The Board of Education insisted that the education in a district, being part of a national system, should be carried out on certain lines which were laid down in their Code, but, of course, there were contributions from the State to the cost which local authorities were under. Then there was the case of the police. The police were under a joint committee, but no doubt the Government had control, and to ensure efficiency they contributed half the expense. Therefore they had a perfect right to step in and say that the police should be managed in the way they thought best. But in regard to matters equally as important as that they were discussing in connection with medical officers of health, such, for instance, as the appointment of the clerk of a county council, or a county surveyor, or a director of education, not the slightest attempt was made to interfere with the prerogative of the local authority to manage their affairs in their own way. The local authority in such cases were free to give what ever directions they chose to their officers who were paid entirely by the authority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01300">It was proposed in the Bill, however, that the medical officer of health should be under the supervision of the Local Government Board to the extent that his duties were to be prescribed by that Department. That, he contended, was entirely contrary to the whole system of local government. If there were duties to be performed by a local authority under the Bill they should be laid down in the Bill, and then the local authority or the county council should be responsible for seeing that their officer carried out those duties in a proper manner. He knew of no case where the duties of an officer appointed by the county council were prescribed by any Department of the Government, and the proposal that the Local Government Board should have this power was, therefore, entirely new. As far as the objects of the Bill were concerned it appeared to be wholly unnecessary that the Local Government Board should have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0174"/>
<col>335</col>
that power. As a matter of fact the county council was not an initiative authority under the Bill. The council only stepped in for the purpose of supervising: to act as a sort of go-between in various matters between the Local Government Board and the minor authorities who were to carry out these schemes. As a matter of fact the work of the county council was to do their best to enforce the provisions of the Bill and to see that the minor authorities carried out their duties. The county councils were in that way in a position somewhat independent of the Local Government Board, and it was extremely undesirable that the officer whom they might have to consult with regard to the way they should use their discretion in enforcing some order on a defaulting authority should have his duties prescribed by a central authority in London who were unfamiliar with local conditions and circumstances. It was possible that in addition to having his duties prescribed for him, the officer might be subject to having suggestions made to him behind the back of the authority who had to pay him and ought to have control.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01301">Serious inconvenience might be caused to a county council if there was any interference with their medical officer and their work might be greatly hampered. While he believed that the medical officer of health of a county was in a sufficiently independent position to be able to withstand any improper pressure, if his duties were to be prescribed by an order of the Local Government Board he might feel that he was more under the authority of that Department than of the county council who employed him. He had never wished to diminish in any way the proper control of the Local Government Board, but he submitted that when they saw a deliberate attempt on the part of that Department to go beyond their own sphere of duties and try to interfere with a county council carrying out their work in the most efficient way it was timely to protest. This attempt to exercise control over matters which a county council should themselves direct was no new matter. He did not wish to speak in any spirit of criticism, or to have any quarrel with the Local Government Board, but in regard to sanitary matters the scope of the county council's powers as the supervising authority of the county was constantly being disputed or inter-
<col>336</col>
fered with by the Local Government Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01302">He thought the county councils were sufficiently responsible public bodies to be trusted to carry out their work in an efficient manner without constantly being interfered with. If every Government Department had treated county councils with the suspicion and the want of confidence which had been displayed during the last few years by the Local Government Board the results would have been very serious as regarded the efficiency of local government. He ventured to say that if the Board of Agriculture, the Board of Education, and the Board of Trade, with whom they had many dealings, had treated them in the same way as the Local Government Board it would have been almost impossible for the county councils to carry out their duties in as satisfactory a manner as they would wish to do. As this proposal was a distinct interference with the prerogative of the major local authority, as it was, in his belief, without precedent, and as it would do nothing but cause friction and unpleasantness between the county councils and the Local Government Board, he hoped the Government would agree to his proposal that the subsection should be omitted.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01304"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> wished to support the Amendment, if only on the broad ground that the proposal in the Bill was contrary to every principle of good government that he had ever heard of. Whatever advantage might lie in empowering the Local Government Board to compel the county councils to perform certain acts and duties, surely it was in the interests of good government that pressure and compulsion should be brought to bear by the Local Government Board upon the county councils direct and not, as was suggested in the Bill, upon one of the servants of those bodies. He could imagine no system of government which was likely to create more friction and to defeat its own object than one of that kind. He and other noble Lords on that side of the House thought the proposal in the Bill was to a certain extent an insult to the county councils, and they held that it was bad in itself.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0175"/>
<col>337</col>
Surely a body like a county council could be trusted. to carry out the behests of the Local Government Board without the Department taking power to give orders direct to the servants of the council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01305"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> confessed at once that His Majesty's Government attached very real importance to this subsection. He could, however, assure noble Lords opposite that in putting down that proposal as part of the measure there was no intention by the Local Government Board to do anything which would interfere in any way with the dignity of the county councils. After all, the county boroughs throughout the country had their medical officers under the Local Government Board in the sense in which it was suggested that the medical officers of health of the counties should be under that Department. The duties of the medical officers of the biggest towns in the provinces, like Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester, were prescribed by the Local Government Board. Yet he did not think anybody would say that the dignity of the corporations of these cities was in any way hurt, or that the duties of their medical officers were any less efficiently performed because of that circumstance. The fact was that in this matter the noble Lords who had opposed the proposal in the Bill were inclined to consider only their own experience. There was no doubt, he was sure, about the efficiency of the medical officers of the counties to which the two noble Lords belonged, or of the efficiency with which they discharged their duties. But might he ask those noble Lords to consider the case of a county council which was not so advanced or so progressive, and whose medical officer of health did not have his duties so carefully prescribed for him as was the case in connection with the county councils with which they were especially acquainted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01306">There were up and down the country county councils which were not so good as others. All were not up to one standard, and those which lagged behind were probably the council which did not send representatives to the Association of County Councils of which Lord Belper was president. He could quite understand, therefore, that the noble Lord should not realise that there was a case which needed to be met. The Local Government Board prescribed the duties of medical officers of health of urban and rural district councils and also of metro-
<col>338</col>
politan borough councils, and it did not seem unreasonable that the duties of county medical officers of health should be similarly defined. He thought noble Lords would see that by the adoption of the provision in the Bill uniformity would be furthered and additional assistance would be afforded to the county councils in the way of getting information. The order of the Local Government Board would not only prescribe the duties of the medical officer of health, but would also instruct him to observe and to execute such directions of the county council as were applicable to his office. That order and those regulations would in no way prevent a county council making such further rules as they might think necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01307">From a Parliamentary Return issued some five years ago it appeared that there was a great diversity in the duties assigned to county medical officers of health. In some cases the officers were paid only low salaries and very little work was required to be performed by them. In other counties larger salaries and more extensive duties were the rule. The clause now under discussion would enable the Local Government Board to prescribe the same duties for all county medical officers of health and thus secure a uniformity which hitherto had been conspicuous by its absence. The clause did not apply to London, where the circumstances were exceptional. He ventured to submit to noble Lords opposite that there really was a case for giving the Local Government Board the authority provided for in the clause, and His Majesty's Government attached a very real importance to the retention of the particular subsection which noble Lords now sought to strike out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01308"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> desired to reinforce, as far as he could, the contention of his noble friends Lord Belper and Lord Clifford. There was a very strong feeling on the part of county councils in regard to the matter under discussion. They did not in the first place, like the idea of the Local Government Board interfering between themselves and their officers by directing the latter to perform certain duties. They disliked perhaps more than anything the wording of the clause which appeared to impose on the Local Government Board the duty of prescribing the duties of the medical officers of health to be appointed, let their Lordships observe, by the county councils. He wished to make a suggestion to the noble Earl opposite which might perhaps to some
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0176"/>
<col>339</col>
extent serve to get rid of the difficulty. He could quite understand that the Local Government Board should desire to prescribe some kind of uniform action on the part of the medical officers of health in regard to matters contained in the Bill, but he did not see why they should go further than that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01309">His suggestion was that the clause might be altered to read, "The Local Government Board may by order prescribe the duties to be performed in matters affected by this Bill by medical officers of health appointed by the county councils." Of course he did not press for exactly that form of words, but something of the kind might be inserted, so that any order made by the Local Government Board should go to the county council rather than to the medical officer of health, and it would be perfectly clear that the county council would be absolutely free, as the noble Earl has admitted they must be, to impose any other duties which were right and proper on their medical officers. He hoped His Majesty's Government would endeavour to meet the very strong feeling on the county councils on this question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01310"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> pointed out that the Local Government Board might even go to the length of ordering a medical officer of health to report direct to them on a scheme. County councils felt very strongly that noble Lords on the Government side perhaps did not trust them as the local authorities did, and that returns might be made to the Local Government Board behind the backs of the county councils. The county councils, he felt sure, would not tolerate that, especially seeing that the returns would be made by officers whom they themselves employed. The fact that it was proposed that the county councils should not have power to discharge medical officers of health showed that the Local Government Board were making a direct attempt to usurp the authority of the councils over their own servants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01311"><member>LORD BELPER</member> said his excuse for again intervening in the discussion was that this was a point of some importance, and he had a complete answer to the argument of the noble Earl opposite that even the medical officers of health of large boroughs had their duties prescribed for them by the Local Government Board.

which was not an initiative authority in regard to carrying out sanitary works or any matters provided for under this Bill. On the contrary, the county council was merely a supervising authority, and helped the Local Government Board to see that the minor authorities in the county performed their duty. Every large Corporation was the sanitary authority for its own district, whereas the county council was not the sanitary authority for its own county. Therefore the duties which were prescribed by the Local Government Board with the object of ensuring that sanitary matters were properly considered and the work was efficiently carried out by the officers of the different authorities did not apply to the county councils, whose powers, as he had said, were only those of supervision. That was a very important difference, and though it might be the case that the medical officers of health of other local authorities had their duties prescribed by the central authority it did not follow that the Local Government Board should necessarily interfere with the way in which a county council exercised their somewhat limited duties with regard to sanitary matters in the county.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01312"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am very sorry that the county councils have regarded these proposals in the way that they have done. There could be no intention whatever of slighting them, but the object, as my noble friend has said, was to secure a minimum standard of efficiency among medical officers of health. Even the most devoted admirer of county councils would admit that the councils themselves are not all equally efficient and intelligent, and those whom they appoint also possess naturally varying degrees of efficiency. But I am conscious that noble Lords opposite, taking the view they do, and possessing the somewhat unreasonable jealousy of the Local Government Board which they have exhibited all through the discussions on this Bill, are not likely to be convinced by anything I can say on this subject. The noble Lord who has just sat down did not, I think, allude to the somewhat modified proposal made by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. I am afraid that it would narrow the operation of the clause to an undue extent if the prescription of the duties of the medical officers of health by the Local Government Board were only to operate in connection with this particular measure which we are engaged in passing in a some-

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01313"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member> asked if the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, wished to bring forward any further Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01314"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that if the noble Earl had stated that His Majesty's Government were prepared to consider his suggestion he would have moved an Amendment; but it would be no use doing so now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01315">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01316"><member>LORD BELPER</member> moved to omit subsection (5)&#x2014;
<quote>"(5) A medical officer of health of a county shall be removable by the county council with the consent of the Local Government Board and not otherwise."</quote>
He did not say that this subsection was as objectionable to the county councils as the one they had just been discussing, but he was surprised to hear the argument used by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill with regard to it, because so far as he knew that argument was wholly applicable to the medical officers of the authorities in the county who were themselves the sanitary authorities of their districts. He did not believe for a moment that it could be alleged either by the noble Earl or by the most rev. Primate, who, he thought, had also supported the proposal, that there had been any case, or suggestion of a case, in which improper pressure had been brought to bear by a county council on the medical officer of health for a county for the purpose of preventing him doing his duty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01317">While there had been officers of health, in a great many counties they had not up to this time been medical officers of health, and in those counties where they had been medical they were men of such high position, and integrity that it would be almost an insult to suppose that they would be influenced by any pressure that could be brought to bear by a member who had got on the council in order to protect the property of himself or his friends from interference. As far as he knew the work of county councils it was
<col>342</col>
quite out of the question that any proposal should be made to prevent the medical officer of health of a county doing his duty in the way he thought most efficient. He was cordially in favour of the proposal that there should be a medical officer of health of every county, because he knew from experience what a great advantage it was to have an efficient officer of that kind. Believing as he did that it would be impossible to bring improper pressure to bear on a county medical officer the provision rendering the consent of the Local Government Board necessary before he could be removed from his post appeared to him unnecessary, and as it was disliked by the county councils he hoped His Majesty's Government would be prepared to assent to its omission.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01319"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said it was with a somewhat acute sense of the hopelessness of the position that he informed noble Lords opposite that His Majesty's Government attached great importance to this subsection also. However, he hoped that even now their Lordships would be inclined to allow this very modest measure of reform to pass. One of the main objects of the Government in this connection was to do their utmost to raise the status of medical officers of health throughout the country. Noble Lords would have seen an Amendment in the name of Lord Harrowby which would come on for discussion later in the evening, and which provided that a medical officer of health of a district who was not in private practice should not be appointed for a limited period only, and should not be removable except with the consent of the Local Government Board. That showed there was a very real desire on the part of people who were interested in this question on both sides, people who were genuine reformers and who were really anxious to proceed on the best lines, to put medical officers of health under the Local Government Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01320">Let them consider the position of the medical officer of health of a minor authority who applied for and obtained a similar post under a county council. If their Lordships did not agree to the clause as it stood the officer would pass from the position

<col>343</col>
of security of tenure which he had enjoyed under the minor authority to the position of being dismissible at the pleasure of the county council. Yet he was sure that everybody was anxious that the county medical officer of health should be the best man who could be obtained to occupy the position. Was a medical officer, however, likely to be attracted by an offer to exchange one position for another under the conditions which would obtain if the subsection were struck out and he was dependent entirely on the will of the county council in the matter of dismissal? This and similar proposals brought forward with the view of raising the position of medical officers of health had been desired by social reformers for many years. Over twenty-five years ago a special point was made of this by more than one member of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes. From that time until on the Second Reading of the present Bill the most rev. Primate referred to the question of the status of medical officers of health, this improvement had been asked for by almost everybody who had any knowledge of local government and was at the same time sincerely anxious for social reform.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01321">He was sure that noble Lords opposite would heartily subscribe to that statement, and perhaps their opposition to the proposal might be qualified if he said that the reform had been asked for by members on both sides of both Houses during all the time he had mentioned. In this matter the Government were asked to have an almost super-sensitive regard for the dignity of the county councils, and in view of the fact that, as he stated in the discussion on the last Amendment, medical officers of health were subject to the Local Government Board everywhere except in the counties he did not think they could be said to be going very far. In any case he would venture to make an appeal to their Lordships to allow the subsection to remain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01322"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> asked if they were to understand the noble Earl to say that the demand came from both parties in Parliament that medical officers of health of county councils should be under the Local Government Board. If so the noble Earl all the time was confusing district councils with county councils. The noble Earl had quoted the Royal Commission of 1884. Was he not aware
<col>344</col>
that there were no county councils in 1884, and therefore no county medical officers of health?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01323"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> observed that he was referring, when he quoted the Royal Commission, to the general status of medical officers, and his remarks in that respect had not special reference to the county councils.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01324"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND,</member> continuing, said that was where the noble Earl showed that he did not understand the question. The status of a medical officer in an urban or a rural district was very different from his status in a county. Everybody knew that. He could not understand how anybody who had served on a county council could imagine for one moment that a medical officer of health was likely to be brow-beaten by any member, and he differed entirely from the noble Earl in his suggestion that a medical officer would prefer to be under the Local Government Board rather than the county council. He thought that very likely the medical officer of a district council might prefer to be, but he doubted such a proposition exceedingly in the case of a county medical officer, who occupied a position very different from that of the officers of minor authorities. The particular proposal in the Bill which they were now discussing was an example of what they saw all through the Bill of the overweening self-confidence and self-approval of the Local Government Board, which thought it could do no wrong. Everybody, it appeared, was to be so thankful for the existence of that Department and was to welcome the chance of being under its authority. He doubted whether it would be such a blessing as noble Lords opposite supposed, and with all due respect to the Local Government Board he thought if that was the opinion held by the Department its officials were living, in a fool's paradise. Nobody was much enamoured of any Government Office and least of all of the Local Government Board. It was quite a mistake to believe that all these county officers were burning to be under the Local Government Board rather than under the county council. He regarded the Amendment as extremely important, and he felt for his part that it would deteriorate the character of the medical officers of health if they were compelled to serve under two masters while performing their
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0179"/>
<col>345</col>
duties in respect of the matters for which provision was made in the Bill. He thought this matter of far more importance than the other question they had discussed as to whether the Local Government Board should send down orders or not, because that was merely the desire of a Government Office to have a lot of red-tape rules, whereas the proposal now under consideration would be fatal to the sanitary work of the county council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01325"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me our great object should be to do nothing which might belittle the authority and position of these great municipal authorities. Until lately it has always been our object to strengthen the position of the county councils, and I confess I regret to see a tendency in the opposite direction now. Surely it is important that the relations of the medical officer of health with his county council should be of the most cordial and intimate character. Is not this proposal, on the contrary, likely to lead to strained relations between the medical officer and his council if the council are aware that he owes allegiance not to them but to a public Department in London? Take a case, for example, where a county council and a medical officer of health have had a difference of opinion. The county council might desire to get rid of the officer and the Local Government Board might thereupon intervene and require the council to retain his services. Would the position of the medical officer of health and the county council after an episode of that kind be a very pleasant one or one very advantageous to the public service? I doubt it extremely. I must vote for my noble friend's Amendment on the ground that I desire to do nothing which might impair the authority of the county council in a matter of this sort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01326"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> was not afraid of the Local Government Board creating friction between a county council and its medical officer of health. He thought that by the first subsection they were going to impose extra duties on the medical officer of health. His experience was that the duties of a medical officer of a county council were very limited, if he carried out exactly the letter of the law. He had practically nothing but a supervisory power, and the amount of supervision he could exercise was very slight.
<col>346</col>
Under the Bill he would have very little independence and, would never be in a position to defy the wishes of his county council as some noble Lords appeared to think. He would like to see larger duties given to the medical officer of health of a county, and he would be glad to have them defined in the present Bill, if it could be done. As regarded the health of the community a great deal depended on water supply, the prevention of overcrowding, and other sanitary matters, in respect of which, especially when dealing with town-planning schemes, they could not look too far ahead. Bearing that in mind he could not help feeling that the medical officer of health should be regarded as one of the most important of the officers whose advisory services were possessed by a county council. The water supply in the county from which he came was a very serious and difficult question requiring very careful consideration. He wanted to see some of the powers of the county medical officer of health defined. He was not sure that it Was a good thing to make the medical officer of health of a county undertake inspection of school children under the Education Act. He might supervise it, but he should not be called upon to devote part of his time to the actual performance of a duty of that kind. The county medical officer should be given a great deal of power, and in order that local government might be rendered truly efficient he should have the rural district council officers working under him. Those being his views he thought it was ridiculous to keep the clause in the Bill at all since, by the action of noble Lords opposite, the opportunity of giving extra powers and duties to medical officers of health had been taken away. He could not help regretting the step which had been taken, and he thought it was one that was not in the interests of efficiency in the administration of county affairs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01327"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> thought that if increased powers were to be given they should be entrusted to the county councils themselves, and the councils would instruct their medical officers of health accordingly. The medical officers should be the servants of the county councils and not of the Local Government Board, who could not possibly be expected to know all the details of the administration of local government in a particular county.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01328"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is with a conviction of the futility and uselessness of doing it that I rise to say one word on this point. In the first place, I may point out that so far as I know county councils in Scotland have as good a conceit of themselves, and with as good reason, as those in England and Wales. I say that because in the Scottish Act there has been for a long time the provision we are introducing for the first time here&#x2014;that every county council should have to appoint a medical officer of health. Then the Act says&#x2014;
<quote>"Every medical officer and every sanitary inspector appointed under this Act or under the Public Health Act shall removable from office only with the sanction of the Board of Supervision."</quote>
Therefore it is, I think, reasonable to point out that county councils here need not regard this as at all an insult. They may say it is unnecessary, but when their companions over the Border have been subject to it for many years I think they need not complain so loudly. My noble friend the Secretary for Scotland tells me that at no time since the provision has existed in Scotland has it given rise to the slightest friction.<lb/>
There is only one other point I should like to refer to. The noble Duke spoke of divided authority. I confess I cannot see that to give a man an appeal to a Public Department against dismissal, as this clause does, has anything to do with setting up a separate authority. When the noble Duke says that a man would rather be without this appeal I must say I beg leave to doubt whether that can possibly be so. Take the case, for instance, of a teacher liable to summary dismissal. If I were to be told that he would be openly grieved if given the right of appeal to the Board of Education against casual dismissal, again I should beg leave to doubt that it would be so. I do not think this matter has been considered on its merits; it has been a question of <i>amour propre</i>, and although I am all for home rule I must say that it can be carried in some circumstances too far. The doctrine held by noble Lords opposite, that under all circumstances home government is better than good government, I can conceive may be open under some conditions to slight criticism.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"A medical officer of health appointed under the said section as amended by this section shall not engage in general practice."</quote>
The noble Earl opposite had said that he wanted to raise the status of medical officers of health in the case of certain counties. That being the case, he hoped the Government would be prepared to give way on this point. He was not asking that medical officers of health should be allowed to engage in the work of a medical practitioner and carry out all the duties of a private practice. What he did ask was that they should not be excluded from holding lectureships in hospitals, or be prevented from examining in Universities. The Local Government Board themselves allowed their own officers to undertake work of that kind, and he saw no reason why medical officers of health should be debarred from doing so. The noble Earl would appreciate the point when he said that in a county of average size the salary of the medical officer of health was about &#x00A3;500 a year, whereas if he were allowed to engage in this research work he might perform all the duties required by his county council, perhaps having a permanent man under him to do the hack work, and have an income of &#x00A3;1,500. It was obvious that the work of the county would be better done by a man who had a salary of &#x00A3;1,500 a year and possessed a higher status than it would be by an ordinary local practitioner who would otherwise take his place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01331">The noble Earl would tell him it was a matter for the Local Government Board to decide, and that the Department would give leave in cases where they thought it desirable to do so. But in this matter the officials of the Local Government Board would be interested parties. The "plums" in connection with hospitals, to which he had referred, were very much coveted, and were desired as much by the doctors of the Local Government Board as by the doctors in the service of local authorities. He did not wish to cast any aspersion on

<col>349</col>
the fairness of the doctors of the Local Government Board, but "C&#x00E6;sar's wife should be above suspicion," and it was best not to put temptation in the way of people.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01335"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said their Lordships had not acceded to the wishes of His Majesty's Government when reasons had been given for not accepting other Amendments dealing with medical officers of health, and therefore it did not seem to him to be very much use to waste their Lordships' time at that late hour of the night. He was quite willing, however, if their Lordships wished it, to deal further with the Amendment. The proposal of the noble Lord was to allow a medical officer of health to engage in a consulting practice. The objection to that was that it might be an exclusive practice and occupy a good deal of his time, thus taking him away from the general work of the county. The noble Lord had a second Amendment on the Paper to the effect that the medical officer of health should not hold any other public appointment. With regard to that he might point out that the object of the provision in the Bill was to make it a rule that the medical officer of health for the
<col>350</col>
county who should be appointed in the future should devote the whole of his time to the duties, but the Local Government Board were given power to allow him to hold other public appointments in special cases. The effect of giving those special powers would be to allow the medical officer of health, with the consent of the Local Government Board, to be appointed for more than one county where a county was small in area and the work was insufficient to occupy the whole of his time.</p>

It would be only graceful in a Government which proposed very drastic legislation of this character not to come forward and try to exempt Crown lands.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01351"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he would be glad to explain the reasons why it had been thought necessary to move this Amendment. Various Government Departments had felt that the powers given to the Local Government Board and the local authorities under the Bill might be exercised to the detriment of the property of the Crown committed to their charge. The Woods and Works Offices were continually dealing with land all over the country while the Admiralty also held large estates. If the Housing and Town-Planning Bill had applied only to England it might have been possible to rely on the implied exemption of the Crown which generally existed in connection with all Acts of Parliament. But the Bill applied also to Scotland, where the position of the Crown was more doubtful in matters respecting land. That was to say, in Scotland a Government Department might be held to be subject to the provisions of any Act of Parliament exactly as any private owner in Scotland was subject to them. Therefore, it was thought necessary to put in a special clause exempting the Crown.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01352"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> asked if it were intended to apply this to the Crown estates in London.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01386"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> moved an Amendment to limit the buildings, structures, and. erections to be dealt with by general provisions prescribed by the Local Government Board to matters affecting their safety and public convenience. This was, he said, a most extraordinary Schedule and he did not quite know how it stood after the changes in the Bill; but a Schedule which enabled a Public Department not merely to settle the buildings, structures, and erections, but all public and private open spaces, certainly seemed very wide indeed. With regard to buildings, structures, and erections, he certainly thought they ought to be limited to the public convenience and safety. He believed the question was raised in another place, and it was asked specifically whether the Local Government Board considered
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0185"/>
<col>357</col>
themselves to be the arbitrators of taste as to all the buildings, and the President of the Local Government Board unhesitatingly said that he regarded that as one of the essential features of the scheme. If all buildings were to be put up according to the plans, not of the local authority, but of the Local Government Board, it seemed to be an extreme evasion of local government power. There was a case in which a Public Department had put such an enormous charge upon a private set of owners with regard to property in Piccadilly that he thought it was worth considering whether it was really fair to allow a Public Department such wide powers as were involved in this Schedule. He thought that probably the rest of the Schedule would have to be considered on Report, but he would ask the noble Earl whether he saw any objection to limiting this paragraph to the public safety and convenience in respect to buildings; otherwise the whole of the plans and the architectural features would be placed under the heel of the Local Government Board.</p>

This Amendment, he said, had a certain importance. Their Lordships would remember an instance given that night by the Marquess of Salisbury of a property which was on the coast and to which there was no access. In that case, and in a great many other cases, such things as roads could only be made by the local authority who had compulsory power to take land. Supposing the local authority made through roads then as the Bill stood at present they would have no power to recover any portion of the cost. He had no wish to place any larger powers in their hands, but he did not see how the Act could be carried out unless the local authority were given power to recover the expenditure in some way or other.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01419"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REDESDALE</member> rose "to ask the Secretary of State for India what steps have been taken towards giving effect to the recommendations of the Committee appointed by the Government to inquire into the possibility of affording better means of instruction in Oriental languages in London."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01420">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask my noble friend the Secretary of State for India the Question which stands in my name. In doing so I may, perhaps, be allowed to allude to the circumstances which have given rise to this Question, and I am afraid that I shall be accused of taxing your Lordships' credulity when I tell you that whereas in Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Vienna, Italy, and Holland there are well-organised, well-equipped, and well-endowed schools of Oriental languages, in London, which is the capital of the country which, apart from its paramount interest in India, in the Malay Archipelago, and in Africa, has larger dealings, and has had dealings, extending over a larger period of time, with the Far East, with China, Japan, and Korea, than any other country&#x2014;in London there is no school of Oriental languages. It is true that in London University and in King's College there is some teaching of those very important languages, but whereas there are twenty-five teachers in London University and in King's College, their united salaries amount to only &#x00A3;1,300 a year&#x2014;that is to say, an average of &#x00A3;52 a year for teachers qualified to teach in Chinese, in the Indian languages, in Japanese, in Hausa, in Malay, and all the various languages with which such a school as we now contemplate will have to deal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01421">The University of London deals chiefly with Hebrew and with the Indian languages, and from the India Office it receives an annual grant of &#x00A3;300. King's College receives an annual grant of &#x00A3;100 from the Colonial
<col>362</col>
Office for the teaching of Hausa; and these miserable pittances, which are really an insult to educated men, are all that is given by Governments in London at the present time for Oriental teaching. Imagine going out to Africa and making yourself an expert in the Hausa language in order to have the supreme hope of coining home to a professorship of &#x00A3;100 a year! It is really incredible. Compare with this the way in which those establishments are treated abroad. In Berlin you have grants of something like &#x00A3;10,000 a year spent on these schools; in Paris and St. Petersburg, &#x00A3;7,000; in Italy, &#x00A3;4,000, and if we consider the position of our men as compared with the teachers in Berlin or in Paris it is really a pitiable aspect of things.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01422">This dearth of teaching led in January, 1906, to a deputation representing the leading men who had occupied important positions for the last thirty or forty years in political, in missionary, and in commercial work, which waited upon the then Prime Minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. With Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman were the present Prime Minister, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, and my noble friend opposite. The Prime Minister gave us a most patient and sympathetic hearing; the Chancellor of the Exchequer was also obviously struck by the arguments which were placed before him that day; and I need hardly say that the Secretary of State for India, whose interest in all matters literary and educational is so well known, was not behindhand in the kindliness with which he received us. In his hands I believe was left the nomination of the Committee which was appointed to consider the organisation of Oriental studies in London. Lord Reay presided over that Committee, and the members, in addition to myself, were Sir Alfred C. Lyall, Sir Thomas Raleigh, Mr. A. R. Guest. and Sir Montagu Turner. We sat for the best part of two years, and examined no fewer than seventy-three witnesses. Among those witnesses were men of great distinction who have made their names widely known in official, missionary, and commercial life. We had Lord Cromer, Sir Ernest Satow, Sir Frank Swettenham, Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, and a number of other witnesses, and, in addition, we had the advantage of having before us the professors from Paris and Berlin, who very kindly came over to this country on purpose to give us the benefit of their experience.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0188"/>
<col>363</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01423">There was, I think I can honestly say, a Unanimity of opinion, or almost a unanimity of opinion, on the part of those witnesses as to the desirability of giving the young men who are being trained for the East a preliminary instruction in London before going out to their posts. The one exception was certainly a very eminent one. Sir Ernest Satow thought that a man might easily learn the language of the country he was sent to in the country itself without any preliminary training, and that is the view taken by the Foreign Office. It is not our view. We think that a great deal of unnecessary labour and great waste of time might and would be saved if there were such a school as that which we have adumbrated. Sir Robert Douglas, who was one of our chief witnesses in regard to the Chinese language, went so far as to say that six months study in England would save two years work in Pekin. That sounds, perhaps, an exaggerated statement, but to anybody who has gone through the mill it is by no means an exaggerated statement. I will tell you why.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01424">There is all the difference in the world between learning a European language and learning an Oriental language. Take the most difficult of European languages&#x2014;Russian. There are so many peculiar points of contact between all Europeans that learning a European language becomes child's play compared with the learning of an Oriental language. It is easy enough to learn a smattering of any language; it is easy enough to learn to ask for food and drink and all the small wants of daily life, but to learn to converse with educated people is a very difficult matter, because in order to converse with an educated Oriental you must, in the first place, have some sort of knowledge of his order of thought and of the genius of the language. What happens is this. A young man goes out, we will say, to Pekin or Tokio, and is put with a Chinese or Japanese teacher. Neither of them can speak the other's language. They are hopelessly at sea, and long weeks pass before any means of communication is set up between them, and at last when they do come more or less in touch with one another there is that great gulf which exists in the different order of ideas. We Europeans, no matter what language we speak, draw almost all our imagery from the ancient classics and from the Bible. We talk about a woman being as beautiful as Venus, of a man being as strong as Samson, of the fall
<col>364</col>
of the Walls of Jericho, and we compare a person to Achilles sulking in his tent, and by all Europeans we are understood; but when you talk with an Oriental gentleman you must understand what takes the place of those familiar images in his language. I do not say that that degree of perfection would be attained in six months by preliminary teaching in London, but I do say that it would save the long weary time of trying to acquire some sort of knowledge of the teacher's languages and of getting, as it were, behind his ideas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01425">But even then your difficulties only begin, because even when you have learnt enough to take in a certain amount of linguistic knowledge from the teacher, you are still met by the want of any preliminary training in the ideas, religion, and customs of the people. All those are things which could be acquired in London before the young man went out to the East; and, perfectly easy to acquire in London, they are enormously difficult to acquire in the country itself because, as I have said, you have not the means of communication, nor does the teacher understand what are the difficulties of the student. I could labour that point, but I do not wish to take up your Lordships' time unnecessarily. I would point out that our present system is wasteful. We send out young officers to China and Japan to study the language and fit themselves for interpreters. They remain for two years, and at the end of that time return and go back to their regiments. It is impossible for them to have acquired such a knowledge of the language which they have been studying as would amount to more than the merest smattering, and a very few months suffice for them to forget that little; whereas if they had been previously trained in London and had then gone out with the knowledge that when they returned they could pursue in London the studies they had already begun, there would be a very different state of things. The young officer would have gained an interest in the subject, and that interest would lead him to follow up his work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01426">The Foreign Office sends out its student interpreters to China or Japan, men who have passed the ordinary examination of the Civil Service Commission. They spend two years at Pekin or at Tokio under the Chinese or Japanese Secretary, and their time is devoted entirely to learning the language. Their case, though I do not
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0189"/>
<col>365</col>
think it is economical or wise, is different from that of the military officer, because the student interpreter on concluding his time at Pekin or Tokio goes off to one of the Consulates, where he is continually practising the language he has learnt, and, as the French proverb says, "It is by working at the forge that a man becomes a smith." But in the case of the military officer the work is, I venture to say, thrown away, and neither he nor the country derives the slightest benefit from the time he has spent abroad. All the evidence that was put before the Committee went to show that foreigners are cutting the ground from under our feet. The Germans are learning Chinese in a way that our men will not. We were told that among some of our young men in the Treaty Ports to learn Chinese was even a bad mark among their fellows. The Germans, on the contrary, are learning all the time. I am old enough to recollect the time, more than forty years ago, when at Pekin there was one German interpreter and he had been trained in the British Legation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01427">We have always been pulling the chestnuts out of the fire for the foreigner in the Far East. The Opium War, the Arrow War, the war of 1860 in which the French joined us, and other movements in which we have taken a leading part and in which hundreds of lives and millions of money have been spent, have all been for the benefit of other countries as much as our own. I do not quarrel with that, but I do quarrel with the fact that whereas we have spent all this money, we have grudged the small sum that would be necessary to take the best advantage of it. The sum that we think would properly equip a school of Oriental studies in London would be something over &#x00A3;12,000 a year, and I venture to think that the time has come when we should spend that comparatively small amount to enable our people to take advantage of the great sacrifice in money and lives that has been made in the past. I leave the matter with the greatest confidence in the hands&#x2014;I think I may say the sympathetic hands&#x2014;of my noble friend the Secretary of State for India, believing that he, at any rate, will do all that lies in his power to relieve this country from what is little short of a national disgrace.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01428"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have very little doubt that His Majesty's Government will give a sympathetic hearing to the very strong case which has been made out by the noble Lord in favour of doing
<col>366</col>
something to encourage the study of Oriental languages in this country; and I hope and believe that we shall hear more than an expression of sympathy from the noble Viscount, and that we shall be told that some definite and practical steps will shortly be taken to insure the object in view. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of this subject. I believe that the authority of Lord Palmerston may be quoted in the opposite sense. Lord Palmerston is alleged to have once said&#x2014;
<quote>"Never pay the least attention to a European who has lived in the country a number of years and speaks the language like a native. Do not believe him: he is always wrong."</quote>
But even if Lord Palmerston ever said that, I imagine he did not intend to deprecate the study of Oriental languages, but to indicate that he thought the man on the spot was apt to get rather into a groove and that his views had to be tested and corrected by those of wider and more general experience.<lb/>
An immense advantage is gained by any Oriental administrator if he can once get rid of the interpreter, or, if he cannot get rid of the interpreter altogether, if he can learn enough of the language to be able to correct the interpretations which the interpreter gives to it. Interpreters in the East hold positions of very great importance, and unless they are very much belied they sometimes are inclined to abuse their positions of trust. For my own part, I have very little doubt that the rather fanciful accounts of Eastern affairs which are occasionally laid before the English public by tourists are due to the fact that they have been obliged to employ interpreters and those interpreters have not been well chosen. The interpreters very often have views of their own, and even if that is not the case, they are amazingly quick at catching any bias on the part of those employing them. The result is that the European, who generally asks leading questions&#x2014;a fatal form of asking questions if you want reliable answers&#x2014;only hears what the interpreter wants him to know, or else what rather tallies with his own preconceived opinions. I need not, however, labour this point. The importance of the question is obvious.<lb/>
I should like to say a word or two about the methods of giving instruction, to which allusion has been made by the noble Lord. There are, in fact, two rival methods. One is to give no tuition in this country, but to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0190"/>
<col>367</col>
leave the young man engaged in Oriental affairs to study on the spot; the other is to ground him in the Oriental language before he leaves this country, and then let him perfect his knowledge of the language when he arrives in the East. I cannot pretend to such proficiency in Oriental languages as to be able to speak with great personal authority on this matter, but I have seen both systems at work, and I have no hesitation in saying that the second of the two systems is infinitely superior to the first. It is quite true that a colloquial knowledge of an Oriental language cannot be acquired in this country. I have known cases of excellent Arabic scholars who came out to Egypt and were able to read the Koran and to talk to well-educated natives, but who at the same time could not give intelligible directions to a Cairo cabdriver.<lb/>
Another point is that if a young man delays his studies till he goes to the East he never studies at all. He is plunged into a quantity of work and has no time for study, and although he gets a smattering of the language he never learns enough to be able to discuss a difficult political or administration question with an educated man. On the other hand, if he once gets grounded here he readily picks up colloquial knowledge when he gets on the spot. That was the course adopted in the case of the young men sent out to Cairo and Khartoum. That system has been eminently successful, and I am very glad to know that the Committee have adopted its general lines. As the noble Lord has said, it is amazing that we should have done nothing on this subject up to the present time, and should have allowed ourselves to be outdistanced by other nations. Not only have we done nothing, but as far as India is concerned during the last thirty or forty years we may be said to have retrograded. I have not had an opportunity of reading the Committee's Report, but I gather from the extracts which I have seen that they have intimated something of the kind. The reason is not far to seek. The old East India Company's system was very defective in many ways, but it had this one enormous advantage, that the young men who went out there lived very much with the natives; they obtained a thorough knowledge of the language, and, therefore, understood the habits of the natives much better than we do at the present time. Now the Englishmen are rather chained to their desks. Moreover, if they have any leave, the means of loco-
<col>368</col>
motion are such that they rush off to England. Thus the know-ledge of the language has rather gone downhill than uphill.<lb/>
It is not to be supposed if this college is established that it will only be of value to the official classes. I believe a great deal of evidence was laid before the Committee from unofficial commercial people testifying to the very great want of such a college in their interests. I have occasionally been asked to recommend young men for commercial employment in Egypt and elsewhere, and I can assure your Lordships that unless you have been through that experience and found out how extremely difficult it is to get linguistic knowledge in this country you cannot realise how very much behindhand we are in this branch of intellectual activity. I hope when this college is established it will not be wholly confined to the teaching of languages. I hope it will also, as far as that is possible, teach something of Oriental history, religion, manners, and customs. Indeed, if such a thing be at all possible I should be very glad to see lectures given by qualified people on Oriental character and mental processes. Everybody who has been in the East knows well that one of the great difficulties he has to encounter is to make himself thoroughly understood. Language is a very important point, but it is not everything. The Eastern and Western reason in an entirely different manner, and arguing from the same premises would often arrive at different conclusions.<lb/>
Let me give your Lordships one or two instances. I remember talking to an Oriental in a very high position in Egypt on an important political point, and I laid before him my arguments, which were, I thought, of a nature to influence a Western mind. I found, however, that they produced not the least effect. Then it occurred to me in the course of conversation to introduce an apologue from the "Arabian Nights," which I found produced a much more clear effect than all my Western logic. Then I remember Lord Wolseley sending me a proclamation which he was about to issue in the Soudan, and which he wished translated into Arabic. It seemed to me so very Western that I asked an Oriental friend of mine who was a great scholar if he would look over it and tell me what he thought of it. He told me that the grammar was perfect and that he understood what Lord Wolseley meant, but he thought that to the Soudanese the proclamation would
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0191"/>
<col>369</col>
be high Greek. I asked him to put the ideas into his own language, and in a couple of days he produced a document which read much more like a chapter of Isaiah than an ordinary official document. If Lord Wolseley had ever issued that proclamation&#x2014;it was never issued, by the way&#x2014;I have no doubt he would have been rather criticised by the Press of this country; but I have not the smallest doubt that a document of that character was much more calculated to influence the Soudanese mind than the incisive language of the document which Lord Wolseley originally drew up. I will not detain your Lordships longer, but I hope His Majesty's Government will take active steps to remedy what is a great national defect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01429"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will feel that you owe a debt to my noble friend for bringing this subject before the House. Lord Redesdale's account of the proceedings of the Committee and the circumstances of its establishment relieve me from going over that story again. We certainly owe&#x2014;not only the Government, but the country owe&#x2014;a great debt to the noble Lord and his colleagues on the Committee for the attention and the labour they bestowed upon the inquiry that was committed to them. As my noble friend said, they collected evidence from authorities of the utmost competence and the widest experience, and what was not the least remarkable part of their proceedings was that they secured evidence of great value from the directors of the Oriental institutions in Berlin and in Paris. It has never been my fortune to study a Report more intelligent, if I may use the word, and more practically useful.<lb/>
It is true that the Report is rather ambitious, and I doubt whether any Government could accept and carry out all the recommendations of the Committee; but, after all, every Committee may be assured that when it makes a Report, anything that I is over-ambitious in its recommendations will not do any harm. There can be, I am sure, no two opinions in the minds of any who have given or will give attention to this Report, as to the serious and direct importance of the subject which the Committee discussed, not only to the public service and the standard of official competency, but more than that, in the sphere not only of political administration but in
<col>370</col>
that of commerce and our material prosperity. The importance of the subject was pointed out by a deputation which waited upon the late Prime Minister, and he characteristically accepted the spirit of the memorial with generous alacrity, and said he was satisfied that the request of the memorialists would fill up a lamentable gap.<lb/>
Then the Committee was appointed. I am not sure that the Indian Secretary is necessarily the person who may be expected to move in the matter, because, as the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, has pointed out, the subject can go a great deal wider than Indian interests. But though a Prime Minister may receive important and interesting proposals with generous alacrity, there arises always the financial question. "There comes the question when all is o'er, the dreadful reckoning when men smile no more;" and we are now confronted with the question how we are to procure &#x00A3;12,750 a year, as the Committee recommends. I know there are those in Whitehall who take an exclusively Treasury view of every proposal constituting what they think a raid on public funds, and who consider that there is no reason in any of the arguments brought forward why British taxpayers should contribute a single halfpenny, and argue that if there were a demand for better opportunities for commercial students to acquire a knowledge of Oriental languages, that ought to be met by the mercantile community itself.<lb/>
In the domain of Indian finance I am a most parsimonious person, and in Indian affairs I always take what I call a Treasury view. I sympathise, as far as it goes, with this objection to raise money from British taxpayers; but after all, I entirely agree with the language of my noble friend and the language and spirit of the Report when they urge us to consider whether, in view of what is being done in Berlin and Paris and in the countries named, it is not to our national honour and credit as well as to national policy&#x2014;as to which I may say a word or two later&#x2014;that a great school of this kind ought to be founded, and whether, if provision can be made on a reasonable scale&#x2014;and I confess I do not think the demand of the report is unreasonable&#x2014;there ought to be any objection in principle to a contribution from the public revenues. If Germany spends &#x00A3;10,000 a year and France thinks the importance of the subject sufficient to justify an expenditure of &#x00A3;7,000 a year, when you consider the enormous pre-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0192"/>
<col>371</col>
ponderance of our interests in the East over the interests of either of those two great countries, we ought to be warranted in spending many times more than those countries.<lb/>
On the occasion when Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman met the deputation, he turned to Mr. Asquith, then the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and said&#x2014;
<quote>"Though he is the stern guardian of the public purse, I do not believe that be will be very hardhearted if the proposals are on a reasonable scale and are likely to confer upon this country the enormous benefits which you [the deputation] expect to accrue."</quote>
The then Chancellor of the Exchequer, now the First Lord of the Treasury, does not show himself hard-hearted; and though I am not yet able to name the specific sum, it will certainly not be less than one quarter of the demand, and it may be a little more. When the time comes we shall submit a Vote on this subject to the House of Commons if it still retains its financial control. That, however, will not be enough, nor will the contributions which the Committee expect from the University of London and from the India Office out of the revenues of India; and if you want to make this a great institution you will have to persuade the great mercantile bodies in the City of London and in Manchester and elsewhere what interests they have in the establishment of such a source of education.<lb/>
India has, of course, an immense interest in the subject; but I should like to read to your Lordships the views of the Committee on the commerical side of this matter, which is certainly not its least important aspect. They say in their Report&#x2014;
<quote>"There now exists a very strong feeling that, if the British are to maintain and improve their commercial position in the East and the Far East, a knowledge of Oriental languages must be regarded as indispensable to the business man doing business with Oriental peoples."</quote>
Sir James Mackay, in the course of his evidence, said&#x2014;
<quote>"A knowledge of the vernacular language by young men going out to join business firms in India would be of the greatest possible advantage in that it would lead to their getting to understand the natives much more quickly than is now the case without such knowledge. Were young men properly taught in this country before going out, and were they to obtain a good grounding in the language of the place where they are to reside they would have every opportunity of improving their knowledge after arriving in India."</quote>
I want those engaged in business with Orien-
<col>372</col>
tal nations to see what an immense gain it will be to them if young men pass through a course of preliminary training before they go out to the East to represent commercial houses. The contribution of India to teaching Oriental languages is &#x00A3;1,750 a year&#x2014;that is, &#x00A3;500 each to Oxford and Cambridge, &#x00A3;300 to London, &#x00A3;300 to Dublin, and &#x00A3;150 to the India Institute at Oxford. The opinion of the Government of India is that India fully pays the cost of meeting the essential demand for a knowledge of Oriental languages, as far as the needs of the Indian Government are concerned; and therefore I do not think it would be very easy for me, or that it would be right that I should press the India Council or that the Government of India should assent to any large contribution to the spread of that kind of knowledge, which is quite as important to a good many other operations in India as it can be to those of the Indian Government.<lb/>
The Indian case is an excellent illustration of how important it is that we should not embark on this with a definite and practical scheme, such as Lord Cromer has asked for&#x2014;and as to which I hope to satisfy him to some considerable extent&#x2014;until we have considered all the difficulties that lie before us. There is a reference made in the Report to the Indian probationers and the question whether more time ought not to be given to the study of Oriental languages and of law by those probationers in England, with an alteration of the age of going out to India. I can only say on that subject that any alteration of the age or duration of the period of probation is one of the most important changes, if change be desirable, that could take place in the system. It has occupied my attention for more than a year, and you cannot effectively deal with the recommendations of the Committee until you have come to some sort of conclusion, which I hope to do before very long, on that particular question.<lb/>
There is one Indian point I should not excuse myself if I omitted. Lord Cromer said, and I was extremely glad to hear him say it, that he hoped this School of Oriental Languages, when it was founded and set working, would not merely be a school of language, but would also be a school for the study of the ideals, the customs, the habits, the religions, and all that gives a character, in truth, to the populations concerned. I very heartily agree with every word that fell from the noble Earl on that subject. In Indian administration,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0193"/>
<col>373</col>
I often wonder how, in Courts of law, justice is done. It is done; I am not in the least impugning that, but there must be difficulty in the doing of it from the ignorance of the judicial authority of all the niceties and <i>nuances</i> of the language of the parties concerned in the suits and proceedings. It is overcome, and I trust and hope that justice is adequately and satisfactorily administered, but I am sure that any one of us who was asked to decide a case, the parties to which and the advocates in which spoke a language which we only knew in an extremely smattering way, would shrink from accepting a post of that kind. Therefore, from the point of view of the difficulty from which the Indian Judge or magistrate labours, the advantage of a more thorough grounding in the languages of the people among whom he lives and administers justice is very obvious.<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to allow me to read a few lines from a man well known to the most rev. Primate&#x2014;the Bishop of Lahore, one of the most remarkable students of Indian matters it has ever been my fortune to come in contact with. The Bishop of Lahore said&#x2014;
<quote>"A thoroughly good knowledge of an Eastern language is a primary condition that must be satisfied if a man is to come into easy and healthy contact with the people of the East, and to exercise a useful influence over them. I feel perfectly certain that one cause of the difficulties that we are encountering in the present time in India is the failure on the part of so very many Englishmen out there to attain to any in the least accurate or scholarly knowledge of the vernaculars of that land, and the consequent impossibility of getting into close touch with the people."</quote>
Many of your Lordships will be able to understand what is under that language. It is very easy to talk, and we all of us talk, of the necessity of sympathy in dealing with the people of India. But sympathy means a good deal more than politeness and good manners, though that is something. Sympathy carries you far further than that if it is to be an effective and genuine sympathy. It means a knowledge and comprehension of the ideals and traditions of the people concerned. That is the point of view to which, I confess, I attach the highest value in the establishment of a college of this kind. I have told your Lordships that we shall propose, by and by, when the thing has been thoroughly settled, a grant from public funds. We shall hope that the mercantile community will also contribute. Perhaps I should mention the points in which the Govern-
<col>374</col>
ment are in entire accord with the recommendations of the Committee.<lb/>
We believe, in the language of the Report, that the evidence of the need for preliminary training in this country, in spite of Lord Palmerston, if he ever used that language, is "overwhelmingly great." The Government agree with the Committee that the seat of this great school should be in London for geographical, topographical, and some other reasons. The Committee say&#x2014;
<quote>"As the metropolis of the British Empire, with its great mesh of relations with the Near East, the Middle East, and the Far East, and with Africa, London ought, in our view, ultimately to be the seat of a greater Oriental school than exists to-day in any other country."</quote>
And they point out that the establishment of a school in London would make it accessible to Indian military and civil officers home on furlough, and that it would be within easy reach of the great military centres of Camberley, Sandhurst, Woolwich, and Chatham.<lb/>
And then there is the University in London. This is delicate ground, because we must be careful&#x2014;no one will be more anxious to be careful than I shall&#x2014;not to do any wrong to, or place at any disadvantage, either the older Universities, which have done the best they could with the funds at their disposal, or the new Universities in provincial centres. These provincial Universities have shown a local patriotism, they have produced liberal funds, and, therefore, I should be very sorry if we were to be a party to the establishment of any educational institution which could be shown to be disadvantageous to these new, and, if you like to call them so, humbler Universities than Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, and Edinburgh. The exact relations that ought to exist between the new School of Oriental Languages and the University of London are not very definitely specified in the Report of the Committee, but they do say positively, after weighing carefully all the arguments for and against incorporation with the University of London, that the balance of argument was decidedly in favour of incorporation. So far, His Majesty's Government are in accord with them, but, so far as my own opinion goes, it ought to be a school with a home of its own, a name of its own, an educational scheme of its own, and with control over its own specified funds.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0194"/>
<col>375</col>
The organisation of the University of London is, I understand, at present undergoing some examination by a Commission over which Mr. Haldane presides, and when that Commission concludes its labours we shall be better able to understand the precise position that the new school will hold in respect to that University; but I for one should always bargain that it should have its own home and name, and control over its own scheme and funds. Though disclaiming the duty, as head of the Indian Administration, to preside over its future operations, carried out by the Government in conformity with the recommendations of the Committee, I have a very great interest in the subject, and a very earnest desire that we should after all these years of rather culpable delay&#x2014;I believe it is impossible not to call it culpable delay&#x2014;now proceed, whether by inviting two or three gentlemen interested in the subject constituting themselves into a sort of executive committee, collecting funds, and drawing out in proper shape the outlines of the relations between this proposed school and the existing institutions or not I cannot say. But I may assure my noble friend and Lord Cromer that the Government are in full sympathy with the object and with most of the detailed recommendations of the Committee which has done such an admirable piece of work.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01430"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps as one who has spent a good many years of his life in one way or another in the Eastern parts of the world, I may be allowed to make a few remarks on this subject. I entirely concur in everything that has fallen from the three previous speakers as to its importance. It is scarcely possible to imagine a subject that is better qualified to arrest the attentions of your Lordships than a subject such as this. Our familiarity, not merely with the languages of the peoples of the East, but with their customs, their feelings, their traditions, their history and religion, our capacity to understand what may be called the genius of the East, is the sole basis upon which we are likely to be able to maintain in the future the position we have won, and no step that can be taken to strengthen that position can be considered undeserving of the attention of His Majesty's Government or of a debate in the House of Lords.<lb/>
I concur also entirely in what has fallen from the noble Viscount the Secretary of
<col>376</col>
State for India as to the value of this Report. By his courtesy I was permitted to have a copy of the Report a day or two ago, and I have studied not merely the Report but the greater part of the evidence. I think it is quite clear that the Government committed the case to the hands of a very competent body, and that these gentlemen were singularly well advised in the witnesses whom they decided to examine. Indeed, if I may say so in the presence of a member of the Committee, I think the evidence of the witnesses was even more interesting than the Report of the Committee. But, however that may be, the Committee give us a Report equally concise and businesslike, and most useful for the purposes of the action which the Government have in view.<lb/>
The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India modestly remarked that he was not the man to move in the matter. If I may say so, I think it would be the opinion of your Lordships' House, not only that he is the man, but that he is the only man to move in the matter, and for two reasons: Firstly, because, as Lord Redesdale has pointed out, we are fortunate in having as Secretary of State for India at the present moment a Statesman possessing a great reputation for scholarship and for literary ability; and secondly, because this matter is really one affecting India more than any other part of the Empire. A good deal of the discussion to-night has turned upon the advantage to merchants, upon the facilities that are required in China, Japan, Korea, and the countries of the Far East. To my mind the question of Oriental studies is far more important in its bearing on India and our position there than on any other part of the world, and no man can be better qualified to take up the case and to carry it through to a successful issue than the Statesman who is for the time being the custodian of our interests in that part of the Empire.<lb/>
I am sure we were very glad to learn that His Majesty's Government view with a favourable eye this scheme. May I say one word upon finance? The Secretary of State told us that he thought the estimated cost would be between &#x00A3;12,000 and &#x00A3;13,000 a year, and he put the question, "Is this not a sum to which the British taxpayer may reasonably be asked to contribute?" Most certainly. Do let
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0195"/>
<col>377</col>
us be quite clear upon the point that it is not fair to go to India and to other parts of the Empire and ask them to pay this small sum to train our officers who go out to the East. The Secretary of State told us that India gives a contribution of about &#x00A3;1,700 a year for the purpose of studies in Indian languages for officers who go out there. That is ample. After all, do let us remember what I think is often lost sight of in this country, that it is the taxpayers of India who pay the whole cost of the India Office&#x2014;&#x00A3;160,000 a year. India bears the whole of that burden. She pays the cost of the Civil servants whom we appoint to administer that country, not only their salaries while there, but their pensions and allowances when gone. She pays the whole cost of that portion of the British Army we send to India. Is it not reasonable and moderate, therefore, that this country should out of its great wealth make some slight return in the education of the officers it sends out to India? Then the noble Viscount came to the question of how we are to get the money. He told us that his powers of persuasion with the Prime Minister, which I believe to be great, have not yet exceeded the point of being able to squeeze more than &#x00A3;4,000 a year from him; but I understood him to say that if the House of Commons still continue to maintain the financial control in future which they have largely exercised in the past, he may get a larger sum. I think His Majesty's Government will find that a much larger sum than &#x00A3;4,000&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01431"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I must be very accurate in reciting the promise of other people. One-fourth of &#x00A3;12,000 odd is nearer &#x00A3;3,000 than &#x00A3;4,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01432"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I think I rather intentionally gave a round sum, with a view, if possible, of committing His Majesty's Government to something beyond their present intention. But, however that may be, I hope His Majesty's Government will see their way to give more than &#x00A3;4,000, because the partition would not be fair if the Government were only to give between &#x00A3;3,000 and &#x00A3;4,000, and you were to look to merchants for the balance. I hope, therefore, that the Secretary of State may use his influence to get better terms for this scheme in the future. I am not denying for a moment that mercantile bodies are interested. I think they are very seriously
<col>378</col>
interested, and more particularly in those parts of the world with which the noble Lord (Lord Redesdale) is most familiar, and where he made his name. In my travels in all parts of Asia, from Yokohama in the East to Baghdad in the West, I have been struck with mingled admiration and dismay at the success which is attending German efforts at the expense of our own, largely owing to the indomitable industry and the command of native languages possessed by the clerks and assistants, and, indeed, most of the members of that great nation. It is not only a warning to us but it is a stimulus to us, and from that point of view I earnestly hope that the mercantile bodies will give the noble Viscount the support which he desires.<lb/>
But, after all, the chief interest in this question is an Imperial interest. And here may I add one or two words to what has been said on the question of India. The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, expressed some fear that in India the movement is in a backward direction, and from the passage which the Secretary of State read out from the Bishop of Lahore your Lordships might derive the same impression, that our officers in that country have not that familiarity with the language and literature of the land which they formerly possessed. I believe that to be perfectly true. I state with regret that I believe the number of British officers, whether civil or military, in India who do not speak the vernacular with any facility or fluency is immensely greater than it was fifty years ago, and decidedly and regrettably greater than it was when I first visited India twenty-five years ago. I believe that the number of British officers in the country who devote themselves to anything like a serious study of the literature of the country is diminishing year by year. I can give your Lordships proof of that. When I was in India I did my best to ascertain, when the annual distribution of honours came round, by an appeal to all the heads of Government in different parts of the country, the names of any English scholars who had devoted themselves either in the discharge of their official duties or in their leisure time to writing works connected with Eastern studies. The number whom I was able to recommend for honours in seven years could be counted on the fingers of the two hands. That was not so
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0196"/>
<col>379</col>
fifty years ago, and even less was it so 100 years ago.<lb/>
We all know the reasons. They are written large on the face of Indian society. The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, himself alluded to them. In the first place, life is much more complex and busier than it was. Officers are overwhelmed with work and have no time for study, and even this Parliament&#x2014;I do not say this House&#x2014;adds very considerably to the labours that are placed upon them. Secondly, as your Lordships know so well, our officers out there maintain much closer and more constant connections with home. Their thoughts lie in England much more than they do in India. In the third place, there is an increasing tendency, not merely on the part of Englishmen in India, but even on the part of cultured and highly educated Indians in India, to lead the European rather than the Oriental life in that country. All these are barriers that stand in the way of intimate study of native languages and customs, and, above all, there is the crowning reason, which has not been alluded to&#x2014;namely, the enormous and ever-increasing number of natives in that country who speak English just as well as we do ourselves. Around every official in India there now exists a sort of zeriba or rampart of natives doing his work for him, talking English as well as himself, polite, obliging, attentive to their work&#x2014;a great advantage to him, but a terrible snare to our administration, because this rampart of competent natives of whom I speak are standing between us and the hearts and minds of the people. It is all very well to deprecate that; it is inevitable. You cannot get away from it. But if that be so, is it not all the more important to take every step we can to improve the position?<lb/>
I do most heartily agree with what fell from the noble Viscount on that aspect of the case. He said it is all very well to talk about sympathy. Sympathy is a feeling which we all possess with the people of India, but sympathy must rest upon some concrete foundation, and when you are brought in contact with them it is no use to say you feel for them in a foreign tongue; you must show that you feel for them in their own language. It is important, therefore, that our officers in India should not only know the language of the people, but should pursue those
<col>380</col>
ancillary studies into their history and customs to which reference has been made. If I may give my own opinion, I would most certainly say that the best officers&#x2014;I am referring more particularly to district officers&#x2014;whom I met in India were those who had the best command of the vernacular, and I could quote instances of trouble which arose in cases where that knowledge did not exist.<lb/>
I would even go further and say that I think the Viceroy would be all the better if he had some knowledge of the vernacular. When I went out to India I was told that it was useless for me to devote any time to the matter as I should be so overwhelmed with work, that I should be surrounded by competent assistants, and that any knowledge of Hindustani would be unnecessary. I believe that to be wrong. If I had known that I was to stay in India five years, still more if I had known that my stay would have extended to seven years, I would have got the most competent man I could and devoted the first three months of my leisure time to acquiring some knowledge of the vernacular. I should have found it most useful to me in going round the villages on famine tours. I should have found it important also in that it would have enabled me to speak to the natives by whom I was surrounded in my own house, and to converse with the native officers when I went to inspect a native regiment. As it was I could only touch the handles of the swords of these men and not say a word to them. It would also have enabled me to speak to native chiefs ignorant of the English language who came into my room, and with whom I had to converse through an interpreter.<lb/>
What is true of the Viceroy, who is only a transient phantom in India, applies much more to the members of the Civil Service, who spend a third of a lifetime there. The same considerations apply in a not inferior degree to the case of the Army in India. The noble Lord in his opening remarks alluded to only one branch of this question. He talked about the prizes of money that are given for passing certain standards in foreign languages to officers of the Army in different parts of Asia. I agree with every word he said as to the small value to be attached to those examinations, not merely for the reasons he gave, but because of the ludicrously low standards that are maintained. Standards are being
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0197"/>
<col>381</col>
lowered from year to year and are almost worthless. Just as it is important for a civilian to be a master of the language for his work in India, so, but perhaps even in a greater degree, it is important that the military officer should be able to talk in their language to his men.<lb/>
In the whole of this Report the passage which filled me with the greatest dismay appears in the evidence of Colonel Ranking, who conducted the examinations in Hindustani and other languages of British officers in India. He stated that within his time&#x2014;during the last twenty or thirty years&#x2014;the knowledge of native languages possessed by British officers in native regiments had diminished by thirty or forty per cent., and he made a bitter complaint about the constant lowering of the standard. This is largely due to the fact that the superior native officers now understand English as well as themselves, and, of course, it is a great temptation to an officer to communicate his orders and do his work through them instead of doing it with his own lips. But the outlook is a serious one. It is upon the contentment of the Army that if an emergency ever arises the stability of our position in India must in the main depend, and, therefore, any means that you can adopt by which the officer can know his men and win his way to their hearts is a matter which ought not to be lost sight of. If this proposal were put forward in the interests of the British Army alone and if it were claimed that the money necessary should be voted from that point of view only, I should say the case was proven without any reference to the Civil Service in India.<lb/>
The noble Viscount alluded to the passage in the Report in which the Committee make the recommendation to the India Office that one year's probationary training in this country is inadequate to give the Indian Civil servant the knowledge of languages which he ought to possess before going to India, and they express the hope that the regulations for the Indian Civil Service will be revised to meet this criticism. That raises a most important issue. It raises the whole question of the age at which it is desirable that your Civil servant should go out from this country to undertake his work in India. The present system has not existed very long. The regulations were altered a few years ago reducing the two years probationary period
<col>382</col>
to one, in order to draw into your mesh the best men from the Universities. To some extent that has succeeded. A man is now able to go through a University course. He may have taken his First or Double First or possibly may be a Fellow of his College, and if he decides to go into the Indian Civil Service you are able to get him for that purpose. You therefore obtain a more developed kind of character and a finer type of intellect for the Service. But the question arises whether at that time of life, because he may be twenty-three or twenty-four when he goes out to India&#x2014;his character may not be too fixed and stereotyped, whether he may not have lost some of the elasticity and receptivity of youth, rendering it more difficult for him to adapt himself to Oriental surroundings. Those are serious matters, and I hope the noble Viscount will not hurriedly or prematurely make any change in the present system. It is a matter that needs the most earnest consideration.<lb/>
But there is one change I hope he will make. The Committee go on to urge upon the India Office the view that selected candidates for the Indian educational, medical, and police services should in future be required to undergo a probationary training in Indian vernacular languages and kindred subjects before they proceed to India. That is most important. Conceive the position in which you send out a well-educated man from England to serve in the Educational Department in India who has to commence his work by giving lectures to Indian students with whom he cannot, except in a foreign tongue, exchange a word. Conceive still more the police officer going out to delicate duties, brought in contact every day, not with the highly-educated sections of the community who talk English, but with people who know nothing but their own language. How can you expect such a man to be of any use at all? How can he avoid the most disastrous mistakes? I hope, therefore, that the recommendations of the Committee as regards the educational and police services may receive the careful attention of the Secretary of State. In conclusion, I wish to say that I entirely agree with the noble Viscount in the proposition that this is a matter in which the honour and credit of the Government of this country are involved, that I warmly welcome the decision at which the Govern-

I merely formally put the Question and reserve any remarks that I may wish to make until after the noble Earl has given his answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01443"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have done my best to get the information that was asked for by my noble friend, but I regret that there has been a good deal of difficulty. In the first place the collection of information as to the export trade in horses rests, not with the Board, but with the Customs, and I am sorry to say that I find on inquiry that the particulars which have been kept by the Customs in the past do not enable them to supply the information moved for. I hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will agree to the discharge of the Order. But we quite agree that it would be very desirable that more complete records should be kept both by the Customs and by the local authorities in the future, and we are in communication
<col>384</col>
with them with a view to arrangements being made for the purpose; and if the noble Earl would be good enough to confer with me and give us his valuable advice on the subject, we should be very grateful.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words as to what has been done to improve the character of this traffic in old horses since the question was brought up in this House on July 29. I said then that a special veterinary inspector would be appointed, and that was done the same week. We were fortunate enough to get a very suitable and practical man for the purpose, and he has worked with the enthusiasm which distinguishes the members of my Department. He has visited every port in this country from which old horses are exported and has had interviews with the local authorities concerned with the administration of the Exportation of Horses Order; he has made trips to the Continent in vessels carrying horses, and has visited the ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp and Ghent, and has made inquiries at Brussels as to horses sent there from the two last-named ports. He has interviewed the owners, or their representatives, of the vessels engaged in this trade and has also visited the collecting centres in this country and interviewed representatives of the railway companies carrying horses by rail to the ports of embarkation. Representations by my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and by my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland have been made to the local authorities concerned as to the administration by the police of the Exportation of Horses Order.<lb/>
The result of our activities in this matter may be briefly summed up as follows. There is now more efficient veterinary inspection of horses prior to shipment and the administration of local authorities is more active. Shipping companies have issued instructions to their masters of vessels insuring the slaughter of any injured horse or of any horse which is not fit to complete the voyage. Humane killers&#x2014;that is, mechanical masks&#x2014;are supplied to vessels carrying horses, and arrangements have been made for more suitable and systematic watering and feeding, both prior to shipment and during the voyage. I trust and believe that the steps we have taken will prove sufficient for the purpose which we all have at heart; if not, I shall certainly ask for further

<title>IRISH LAND BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01451" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01452">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01453"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill, I am disposed to begin by apologising for the unavoidable fact that it cannot be introduced here by a regular representative of the Irish Office. This question of Irish land purchase and the working of the Irish Land Acts is one in which I have, naturally, taken a keen interest from my former connection with the Government of Ireland; but I cannot pretend to have been able to give to it that continuous personal attention which would be necessary in order to make a statement of this kind really acceptable to those noble Lords opposite who are in perpetual contact with it and are acquainted with all its ins and outs.<lb/>
There is a further difficulty in connection with the question affecting your Lordships' House as a whole. It is an extremely difficult and technical question, and although as I have said, there are many of your Lordships largely, no doubt, represented here to-night, who are familiar with it in all
<col>388</col>
its bearings, yet there are others, probably the majority of your Lordships' House&#x2014;if the whole House were collected here&#x2014;to whom its terminology is not much more intelligible than Hebrew. And therefore, to commend a Bill of this kind to the House as a whole without appearing superficial to the experts or unintelligible to the less-informed is not an easy task, and it is one with which I am afraid I may not be able to cope.<lb/>
This Bill divides itself into three parts, not precisely represented by the numbered parts in the Bill as printed. The first division deals with the finance of land purchase as carried out under the Act of 1903, the second with changes in the plan and method of purchase, including the introduction of the principle of compulsory purchase, and the third with some changes in the constitution and powers of the Congested Districts Board. The first of these divisions, that of finance, is the one which has made the introduction of some such measure&#x2014;in our opinion, this measure&#x2014;not merely desirable but imperative. It is obvious, even to those who have observed this question only from the outside, that the time has come when some change or other is bound to take place in the financial system under which land purchase is being carried out in Ireland. If I might assume for a moment that the Act of 1903 is carried on by a great limited company, I should say that that company finds itself face to face with the prospect of liquidation. A new board of directors has to administer the affairs of the company, a different board from that which administered them when the company was first formed, and the consequence is that, if bankruptcy is to be avoided, some scheme of reconstruction becomes necessary, and the different classes of shareholders involved have to consider how that scheme of reconstruction had best be put into force. There are three classes of shareholders in this company&#x2014;one represented by the whole body of taxpayers of the United Kingdom, the second by those who have the land to sell, and the third those who desire to buy it. Therefore, I put this Bill forward as what the Americans call "a business proposition," and I hope it may be considered as such, without the use on either side of the language of recrimination, which to my mind is altogether unsuited to its consideration, because we are face to face with a business difficulty, and we ought, I think, to meet it in a business spirit.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0201"/>
<col>389</col>
Why is it that Irish land purchase finds itself face to face with something approaching bankruptcy? Your Lordships know what conditions obtained under the Act of 1903. Under that Act the State advances to the tenant in Ireland, for the purpose of purchasing land, cash to such amount as is necessary, provided that that amount gives security for ultimate repayment in sixty-eight and a-half years, and, also, for payment during that period of interest at the rate of three and a-quarter per cent., ten shillings per cent. of which represents sinking fund for amortisation of the debt. The cash which is handed to the tenant with which to pay the vendor is raised by the issue of two and three-quarters per cent. Stock. The annuities payable by the tenant pay the interest on the stock and the sinking fund; but, in addition to that, it was foreseen from the first that there might arise contingent liabilities of various kinds, and those contingent liabilities were secured on a guarantee fund amounting, in all, to the effective sum of &#x00A3;1,160,000 a year. The principal contingent liability arose, as all the world knows, owing to the state of the money market, it being necessary to issue the stock at a discount, and the guarantee fund is liable for payment of the interest and sinking fund on that amount of excess stock, as it is called. The guarantee fund consists of the development grant, which amounts to &#x00A3;160,000 a year, and of the death duties and agricultural grants, which together amount to just about one million sterling a year. But as all the world also knows, those last two amounts go in ordinary course to the relief of rates in Ireland; consequently, if they are called upon to pay any of these contingent liabilities the loss falls at once and directly upon the general body of Irish ratepayers.<lb/>
What is the position in which land purchase now finds itself? Before the year 1903, under the previous Purchase Acts, between two and three million acres of land had been sold for about twenty-five millions sterling. Up to September 15 a further amount of some eight million acres have been sold or agreed to be sold, and in respect of these transactions thirty-two millions sterling have already been advanced and some fifty-three millions sterling are still due in respect of pending agreements. I may say in passing that the calculation which we make is not one which is altogether accepted; but it represents, I think, something of a half-way house between opposing
<col>390</col>
views. The calculation that we make is that the remaining land in Ireland which might become the subject of purchase is somewhere about eight million acres, which might be expected to cost some seventy-five millions sterling.<lb/>
We all know that throughout the transactions which have so far taken place there has been a loss in respect of excess stock. To put it shortly, the loss on the excess stock, taking together past and pending agreements, amounts to a sum which would require &#x00A3;400,000 a year to meet. For the future there will be a further loss involving the payment of a further &#x00A3;240,000 a year&#x2014;that is to say, that over and above the amounts which can be charged on the development grant these further grants will ultimately become liable for the payment of about &#x00A3;640,000 a year. This is a charge which, unless something is done, will automatically under the Act of 1903 fall on the general body of Irish ratepayers. What is to be done? It cannot be denied that the money is there, and can be intercepted on its way to the Irish ratepayers, but there is a general agreement shared by both sides of the House that it is not possible to act in the strict letter of the Statute of 1903 and to call on the Irish ratepayers to make good the whole of this sum. It may, of course, be asked why, if this was so, was this particular security ever put into the Act of 1903. That is a question which I do not feel bound to answer, because the Act of 1903 was not our Act, but was the Act of noble Lords opposite. I think it entitles us to say, avoiding, as I desire to, all terms of recrimination, that the finance of the Act of 1903, if not absolutely speculative, was, at any rate, exceedingly hopeful, and when we are told that it was never seriously meant that Irish ratepayers should themselves become liable to this charge, and that if the necessity arose the Treasury would come forward and find whatever was necessary, I ask your Lordships to find me another Act under which an explicit provision is to have no effect at all, whereas a provision which is not in any way implied in the terms of the Act is held in a few years to be operative. I am certain that you can find no such measure. This Act of Parliament has to be construed like other Acts of Parliament, according to its text.<lb/>
This state of things, hopeful though the finance of 1903 might have been, was not altogether unforeseen. Speaking on July 6,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0202"/>
<col>391</col>
1903, Mr. Ritchie, who was at the time Chancellor of the Exchequer, said&#x2014;
<quote>"If money cannot be raised at two and three-quarters per cent., the Bill will not work."</quote>
Money has never been able to be raised at two and three-quarters per cent., and the Bill has not worked. From what happened in 1902 it might have been supposed that this breakdown would be foreseen. Mr. Wyndham, at that time Irish Secretary, introduced what I believe he has himself spoken of since as a trial Bill. Under that Bill the rate of annuity to be paid by the tenant was three and three-quarters per cent., of which three and one-eighth per cent., by Mr. Wyndham's own statement, ranked as interest, the remainder being sinking fund. At that time Consols stood at ninety-four. In the following year, Mr. Wyndham introduced his Bill, which is now an Act, by which two and three-quarters per cent. was the rate payable for interest and half per cent. was payable for sinking fund, and yet during that year Consols had dropped to ninety, and the position, therefore, in regard to the issue of stock was four points worse than in the previous year.<lb/>
I think we more or less realise how it all happened. The Act of 1903 was carried through Parliament in a burst of generosity and good feeling. It brought various parties and classes in Ireland into closer association than they had been for, I was going to say, countless years, and the result was that everybody was so occupied in shaking hands and drinking each other's health that the finance of the Bill did not receive that close and almost morose attention which financial proposals of the kind generally receive. That is the explanation. I hope I have not stated it in a captious or too critical spirit but the fact remains that there was no warrant in the state of the money market or in the future of the money market, so far as could be foreseen, for supposing that British first-class securities would rise to a point which would make this particular transaction sound. That is the fact and it is a fact the result of which we have to face in the year 1909. It may be said that if His Majesty's late advisers had remained in office so marked an era of prosperity would have reigned that public funds would have risen to an extent which would have made these transactions less disastrous. That, however, must remain a matter of pure speculation. So far as the actual issue made by them is concerned it
<col>392</col>
amounted to eleven millions sterling at an average of eighty-eight and a-half. A much larger amount&#x2014;that of thirty millions&#x2014;has been issued by the last two Governments, the late and the present Government, at just a shade below eighty-eight, and having regard to the amount issued there is no material difference between the rates of the two sets of transactions.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, what do we propose&#x2014;representing those shareholders if I may carry on my metaphor who are the taxpayers of the United Kingdom&#x2014;what do we propose to contribute in view of this deficit? In the first place the Exchequer takes over and is responsible for the whole of the excess on the fifty-three millions. That is taking over an amount of something like seven millions sterling&#x2014;an extra charge of from &#x00A3;220,000 to &#x00A3;230,000 a year. It also takes over two millions excess in respect to the bonuses on that amount, and it provides a further four millions towards the new bonuses after the amount of twelve millions is exhausted, and the excess upon the issue of that amount; so that, speaking generally, it is not, I think, an over-statement to say that before we have done with this transaction the cost to the Treasury can hardly be expected to be less than twenty-five millions sterling, and it might be something more.<lb/>
Your Lordships all know that there has been a disastrous block in the carrying out of sale and purchase under the Act of 1903, sufficiently indicated by the figure which I have given of the amount of agreements pending. The possibility of that block was to some extent foreseen, but it was supposed that the landlords, having sold their property and the transaction being completed, would not mind standing out for a considerable period. That was said by friends of noble Lords opposite in response to the criticisms that were made at the time of the possibility of a block.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01454"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Who said it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01455"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I will try and find the quotation. I think it was said in debate in another place. But what Mr. Wyndham said, in introducing the Bill of 1903, was this&#x2014;
<quote>"This operation [the making of advances] must be undertaken with due and jealous regard to the national credit &#x2026;. I say emphatically that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0203"/>
<col>393</col>
it will be neither financially prudent nor administratively possible to expand these operations at a pace so high as to make us come to the City for more than &#x00A3;5,000,000 in any one of the first three years after the passing of this Bill. It could not be done &#x2026;. After three years, in my opinion, it will be possible and desirable to mend the pace. We ought to be able after three years so to mend the pace, as far as we are concerned, as to enable all saleable land to be sold in the course of some fifteen years."</quote>
Bearing in mind the whole question of the loss on excess stock, I think it is fair to conclude that Mr. Wyndham, when he said it would be possible to accelerate the pace after three years, meant that it would be possible to float on the market larger quantities of Irish land stock than five millions without undue loss. He may have thought that after three years there would be the Deluge, and that he and his friends would not be responsible for what might happen. But I do not think that was so. I think the whole forecast is of a piece. He believed that Consols and other first-class securities would rise, and that then it might be possible, when the Estates Commissioners had got fairly into their stride, to enlarge their operations and also to float large amounts of stock on the market. That expectation, as we know, has been disappointed.<lb/>
Criticism has also been freely levelled at the Government for not in any case having enabled transactions to go faster by means of an increase in the staff of the Estates Commissioners. We have increased that staff to some extent, but I frankly say that the staff might have been, and probably would have been increased to a larger amount before but for the terrifying loss, if I may say so, to the taxpayers in respect of those large issues of stock. The Treasury undoubtedly were not prepared to go beyond the five millions, or a little more, which Mr. Wyndham promised so long as the Wyndham conditions remained. It was clearly impossible for Mr. Wyndham to pledge the Treasury, with which he might not be in any way concerned, to take a particular action in circumstances which he could not foresee after a lapse of three years, and we have never I think concealed the fact that that was one factor which made it impossible to increase the staff up to the point of dealing with &#x00A3;8,000,000 or &#x00A3;10,000,000 of transactions up to the present time.<lb/>
I can assume from what has been said outside that in respect of these purchase
<col>394</col>
provisions various objections may be raised. It may be said, in the first place, that it is disastrous that the tenant's annuity should be raised from three and a-quarter to three and a-half per cent. We would gladly avoid doing that if it were possible, but it does not seem to be altogether unreasonable that the tenant should stand in in respect of the general transaction which involves a certain degree of sacrifice&#x2014;by far the larger sacrifice, I may say, in the case of the taxpayer, but a certain degree of sacrifice from everybody concerned in the transaction. I know it will be said&#x2014;Why, instead of raising this, do you not lengthen the term of repayment? I believe that financial purists consider the existing term of sixty-eight and a-half years as being economically indefensible, and I do not think that any set of Ministers could get the Treasury to agree to such enlargements as seventy-three, seventy-five, or more years, which I have heard of as being proposed in order to make the tenant terms easier.<lb/>
Then we come to the supremely important provision in this relation which empowers the Treasury to issue stock instead of in all cases paying in cash. This is not the first time that such a proposition has been made because in the year 1905, before the block had reached its present formidable dimensions, Mr. Walter Long, who was at that time responsible, made this suggestion in the debate on the Irish Estimates. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"There should be amending words introduced in a single-clause Bill to enable the vendors, if they so wish, and only if they so wish, to take a portion of the purchase-money in stock. What I propose is that two-thirds of the purchase-money should be the maximum to be taken in stock, one-third in cash, the bonus in cash, and the stock to be at its face value."</quote>
It is only fair to add that that suggestion appears to have been scouted by every one concerned, and no more was heard of it. But still it was a proposition made by a colleague of noble Lords opposite, and I hope that they will bear the fact in mind. I hope they will also bear in mind that, taken as Mr. Long put it, it was a considerably worse transaction for the landlord than that which we propose at this moment.<lb/>
There are, as I have said, fifty-three millions of pending sales. Out of this sum forty-eight millions are in respect of direct sales between landlord and tenant. The proposition which we make is that as hitherto there has been a certain classifica-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0204"/>
<col>395</col>
tion adopted by the Estates Commissioners a fresh classification of a different kind should be introduced. Assuming that it is only possible owing to the state of the money market to go on issuing at the average rate of five millions, one million of that total would be required for sales to the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners. That would leave four millions available for cash payment, and the suggested classification is that two millions of that four millions should be available for those who either wish or are bound to take all cash; that another two millions should be available for those who are able and willing to take half in cash and half in stock, and that two millions of stock should be issued for those who are willing to take all stock. That would be &#x00A3;8,000,000 of transactions to be conducted within the space of a year, plus the &#x00A3;1,000,000 in respect to the indirect transactions with the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board. With the arrangements which will be made the Commissioners ought to be able to cope with these transactions up to the amount of nine or ten millions a year. It is suggested that the three sets of transactions should proceed <i>pari passu</i>. At first sight this may sound as though no particular advantage would be gained by taking part in stock; but a little consideration, I am sure, will show noble Lords opposite that those who are prepared to take half in stock would have their transactions greatly accelerated thereby, and I should suppose that there must be a considerable number of cases where a man who has an estate mortgaged to not more than half its value, which I hope is not an infrequent case, would be prepared to take half in cash, which would be sufficient to clear off all his mortgages, and the remainder in stock, which, at ninety-two, represents an investment of practically three per cent.<lb/>
I pass for a moment to another set of objections which may be made in relation to what is called the land purchase aid fund, but which is more affectionately known to its friends by the name of the bonus. As your Lordships know, the bonus has been at the rate of twelve per cent. payable up to November 24 of last year. That was the date on which the Treasury, as it was empowered to do under the Act of 1903, stepped forward and said that the fund was running so low that the bonus must be cut down, and it fixed the bonus for the future at the sadly collapsed figure of three per cent. By our
<col>396</col>
plan we introduce a sliding scale in inverse ratio to the number of years purchase, and I cannot help thinking that it would be difficult to show that that is not a reasonable and fair provision. It cannot be denied that there were a certain number of cases where the landlord got too much in the earlier days; he got more than he would have got if he had put his land up in the open market in England, where there was no land question. That was due to the fact that, in addition to obtaining twenty-five or twenty-six years purchase, which most people would consider adequate, he also obtained a large sum by way of bonus. It is hardly fair to suppose that State money ought to be advanced for purposes of that kind, for the amount of State money is limited. A, man getting twenty-five or twenty-six years purchase, which is as much as he can get in a great many parts of the United Kingdom, if not in most, should not, further, receive this lump sum, which may reach a considerable amuont. The effect of our change is estimated to work out at a bonus of seven and a-half per cent. all round; the average difference between seven and a-half and twelve per cent. represents another small contribution from the owners of the land to the settlement of the finance of this question.<lb/>
We probably shall be asked why it is that we do not issue Consols for the whole amount to the extent of &#x00A3;8,000,000 or &#x00A3;12,000,000 a year and cut the loss. If there is one financial expedient against which we have all been warned all our lives it is to avoid frequent and intermittent issues of Consols. I imagine that anybody who desired to do so would have to march over the dead body of every clerk in the Treasury. A noble Lord says "Hear, hear," but the combined opinion of the Treasury and the City of London must govern the action of Governments in a case like this. We cannot depend on amateur advice, however capable, in a matter of this kind, and we are quite determined not to depart from the wise procedure both of all the Governments of noble Lords opposite and of Liberal Governments in former years in not casting these Consols on the market in large amounts with consequences to the national credit that cannot be foretold, but the gravity of which cannot be easily overrated.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I pass to the second division of the Bill, that dealing with the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0205"/>
<col>397</col>
land purchase provisions. It is said that we desire to abolish the zone system. There are a number of people in Ireland who would like to, but we are not of that number, neither are the Estates Commissioners, and for very obvious reasons. The abolition of the system of zones provided in the Act of 1903 would throw a vast amount of extra work on those concerned with the business of the purchase and sale of land, and must consequently tend further to retard its progress. But experience has shown that there are cases in which the effect of the provisions as to zones has been disastrous in this way, that it has brought about transactions which do not offer the proper security for the advance made. It may be that a rent, nominally judicial, is an agreed rent which the holding is really not capable of bearing, or there may be cases where, since a rent was judicially fixed, something has happened&#x2014;either the exhaustion of turf or some natural accident like a slide&#x2014;which has made the holding worth less than when the rent was fixed. If in such a situation the purchase money is calculated on the judicial rent the Exchequer may be without its due security, and it is simply in respect of transactions of that nature&#x2014;I have, of course, not exhausted all the possibilities&#x2014;that we propose to amend the provision with regard to zones.<lb/>
Then there is the very important point as to compulsory purchase, which also has received some criticism which is not the result of complete understanding. The last thing we desire to bring about is anything like a general plan of compulsory purchase The terms of our Bill sufficiently prove that, because if all the transactions became compulsory all our suggestions with regard to payment in stock instead of cash would come to an end, because where compulsion is applied the payment must be in cash. The whole process of compulsory purchase must necessarily be a costly one, and it involves a degree of minute inquiry which naturally makes it, for the same reasons that I stated just now, unacceptable both to ourselves and to the Estates Commissioners. Still there are cases. I do not know that anybody will deny that sooner or later, before the whole transactions under the Act of 1903 come to an end, it will be necessary in certain cases to apply compulsion. That is to say, if the whole of the land contemplated to be sold under Mr. Wyndham's,
<col>398</col>
Act is to come into the market, and if it was not contemplated that the whole of the agricultural land of Ireland should sooner or later become the subject of purchase, I confess that in my judgment a further limitation ought to have been made from the very beginning as to the selling of a certain number of estates which those who sold them had a perfect right to sell, but which from the point of view of public policy and interest it was not in the least necessary should be sold. Estates have been sold in Ireland and large prices received for them which, so far as one can judge, were, and were likely to remain, perfectly peaceful, where the rent was regularly paid and excellent relations existed between landlord and tenant. If the whole of Ireland had been like that there would have been no question of an Irish Purchase Bill; and if it was intended to apply limitations and to say that the whole of Irish land was not to come into the market something ought to have been done to prevent those large transactions which have exhausted so much of the public money advanced without doing nearly as much as Mr. Wyndham's Act ought to have done to appease the land difficulty in Ireland. I do not see how it can be disputed that in two classes of cases compulsion may be legitimately applied. The one is the case of a landlord who may be cantankerous, if there is such a person as a cantankerous landlord in Ireland; and the other is the case where land is actually needed for the relief of congestion which could not be relieved in any other way. We have no desire to introduce a system of general compulsion; but so far as congestion is concerned, whether it is technically within the congested area or outside it, we are strongly of opinion that it is not possible to dispense with this weapon of possible compulsory service in the background.<lb/>
I defer any observations on a clause which I know has led to a certain amount of cavil&#x2014;the clause which deals with the question of new tenancies, because I think that is a point which can be better dealt with in Committee; but I should like to say a word about the power given by Clause 17, because that is a matter of some considerable importance. Clause 17, which deals with advances for purchases of parcels of land and the class of persons to whom such advances may be made, is a modification, and in some degree an amplification,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0206"/>
<col>399</col>
of Section 2 of the principal Act, and I have no doubt that some of your Lordships will say that no such amplification is necessary. The two points in which the section is enlarged are mainly these&#x2014;that not only the son of a tenant or a proprietor of a holding on the estate but also one in the neighbourhood of the estate becomes a possible purchaser, and also, by subsection (<i>e</i>)&#x2014;and this is a provision which sounds alarmingly wide&#x2014;
<quote>"any person to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission after considering the requirements of persons mentioned in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection an advance ought to be made."</quote>
We are told that this provision was inserted under strong pressure in the interest of those who are known as landless men, that is to say, the sons of farmers, large or small, in the neighbourhood of untenanted land. The landless men did not exist when I was in Ireland. Noble Lords opposite will confirm me in saying that the phrase was unknown. The farmers' sons were supposed to be largely responsible for the frequent amount of poaching which went on in the rivers in the west of Ireland, and were also supposed to be responsible for some parts of the various kinds of mischief which occurred in the disturbed part of Ireland. But that they were a body of men making a settled demand to be planted on the land was a suggestion which fifteen years ago, and I imagine for some time longer, was, so far as I know, never made.<lb/>
Now what has produced the landless man? I think it cannot be disputed that he is to no small extent the offspring of the Act of 1903. Section (2) and Section (8) of that Act break, not absolutely for the first time, but break finally, with the idea of land purchase which had hitherto obtained in Ireland&#x2014;namely, that of direct sale from landlord to occupier. I do not say that it was not necessary to break with it, but when you have broken with it you open the door for an entirely new kind of land hunger, and it is from that kind of land hunger that so much difficulty has since arisen. I think, also, that the mere fact of turning the occupier into a purchasing tenant must have tended towards the same result, because it seemed to stereotype the position of particular parcels of land in particular hands, and made those who had not land feel alarm that there would not be enough to go round, and that in no circumstances, however long they
<col>400</col>
might live, would they have a chance of getting a farm.<lb/>
Those are the by-products of what, on the whole, is a beneficent piece of legislation. And I think it is fair to point out that the Act of 1903 was in this respect the thin end of the wedge, that it started this notion of obtaining land for the landless which has so gravely complicated the problem which we are endeavouring, so far as it is soluble, to solve by this Bill. But so far as the last subsection is concerned that is not intended to apply to landless men at all, and it has been misunderstood if any one thinks it is. Still less is it intended to apply to a gentleman who, having a small house in the North Circular-road, thinks that he would like to acquire a farm somewhere in the west of Ireland. This particular subsection&#x2014;subsection (<i>e</i>)&#x2014;is meant to meet the case of certain parts of many estates which are not strictly agricultural, and with which, in spite of that fact, the Estates Commissioners desire to deal, such, for instance, as one of those small houses surrounded by laurels of which there are probably more in Ireland than in any other country in the world. This clause enables such a building, or the doctor's house, to form part of an estate and be so disposed of.<lb/>
I pass on to say one or two words about the provisions relating to the Congested Districts Board. We have all regarded with admiration and almost with awe the bulk of the work performed by the Commission which is associated with the name of the noble Earl, Lord Dudley. We admire their vast industry, the devotion which they gave to their work&#x2014;and their position was sometimes difficult&#x2014;and we all feel that there is much to be learned from the results of that inquiry. The Report of that Commission asked that the funds at the disposal of the Congested Districts Board should be increased to &#x00A3;300,000. We have not quite felt able to do that, but we have come forward&#x2014;and this, I think, is a point in the Bill which will be generally approved by your Lordships&#x2014;and increased their funds to a total of &#x00A3;250,000. Certain powers of the Congested Districts Board are transferred to the Agricultural Department and that is another point in which I think we may expect your Lordships' general approbation. There are two points on which I may expect criticism. The first is the extension of the area with
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0207"/>
<col>401</col>
which the Board has to deal; the second is the reconstitution of the Board itself. That reconstitution follows somewhat closely the recommendation of the Dudley Commission. That Commission suggested that there should be four <i>ex officio</i> members, four appointed members, three paid members, and nine representative members&#x2014;twenty in all. We have somewhat modified those suggestions by making it three <i>ex officio</i> members, five appointed members, two paid members, and nine representative members. The provision for representative members is one which, I have no doubt, will give rise to some discussion. I think it is fair to point out that the work of the county councils in Ireland, even in the most backward parts of Ireland, taking into consideration the almost complete lack of official experience among many of those who served on them, and taking also into consideration the fact that feeling runs high on many points, social, political, and religious, in Ireland&#x2014;that work has, I believe, speaking generally, done them the highest credit, and has surprised even some of those who were most sanguine as to the result of the legislation, of which, as we know, noble Lords opposite have the credit.<lb/>
It is important, therefore, in consideration of that fact, and in view of the enlarged responsibilities of the funds allotted to the Congested Districts Board, that there should be a measure of popular representation upon that Board. It is carefully limited, and direct dealing with finance is confined to the more permanent members of the Board. But there is also a further point which has actuated my right hon. friend in making this suggestion. As we all know, one primary difficulty which faces us in the question of the relief of congestion is the rivalry which is supposed to exist, and no doubt does exist to some extent and in some parts of Ireland, between what are called "congests" and the landless men for the possession of such land as may be found available. That conflict of desire and opinion is a misfortune which we have to face, and have to make the best of; and in our opinion if it is to be solved at all it can only be done by securing some measure of support from public opinion in those parts of Ireland which are affected. It is certainly true that you cannot hope to dump down a number of people from congested districts upon farms, which may be only slightly removed, or which may be removed
<col>402</col>
by some considerable distance, from their former homes if there are in the neighbourhood of the new farms a number of these landless men who desire farms. You cannot treat the migrating congest as if he were an emergency man, conducted to his work by a policeman with loaded rifle on each side of him. That, of course, would make your scheme of migration an economic farce.<lb/>
But, on the other hand, are you prepared entirely to give up the relief of congestion by the enlargement of farms, and, to some extent, by what is known as migration? Without some degree of migration you cannot deal with these areas of congestion because in many of the congested areas, as we know, there is no land available. Therefore, unless you are prepared to fold your hands and sit helpless, you must do something positive. As far as we can see that can only be done by establishing some kind of <i>modus vivendi</i> between the two classes. It is all very well to say that the claims of the landless men are unreasonable. Perhaps they may be. I ventured to point out a short time ago what in my opinion is the natural history of the landless man. But there he is, and unless you can arrive at some form of compromise by which, by a general agreement enforced by this representative element on the Congested Districts Board, provision may be made to some extent for both classes, you have to admit that your last chance of relieving congestion is gone. We are most unwilling to make that admission, and that is the prime reason which makes it necessary to have some representative element on the Congested Districts Board.<lb/>
I have endeavoured to set the question before your Lordships more or less as a whole. I am aware, of course, that I have omitted to deal with a great number of points&#x2014;some of no small importance&#x2014;which arise on the different clauses. I believe that if your Lordships will look at it as a whole, making such criticisms as you think fit on certain points, the Bill will not be found wanting. To make a personal confession, I have never been one of those who have been most enthusiastic for a complete scheme of Irish land purchase. There I am in a very small minority indeed. Noble Lords opposite and the Nationalist Party in Ireland have always held out a scheme of general land purchase as a panacea for the land difficulty in Ireland. I have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0208"/>
<col>403</col>
always thought, and. I do not know that I am altogether wrong, that a scheme of general land purchase would produce a new crop of difficulties, different, but in some respects not less formidable than those which surrounded the question of dual ownership, That is a personal matter and concerns myself alone. Both sides have agreed that purchase is the panacea, and we must make every effort and lose no opportunity of making land purchase work. This Bill represents, after long thought and closest devotion to the subject on the part of the Chief Secretary, our effort with that object. I therefore, with some courage, ask the House to assist us in making this measure a success, dealing with it with as gentle a use of the English language as is compatible with the discussion of any Irish question, and thereby, as I hope and believe, bring about a real measure of pacification of the Irish land difficulty.<lb/>
But I know that there is a Motion on the Paper for the rejection of the Bill, coming, I confess, from a somewhat unexpected quarter. The noble Earl who is about to move the rejection of the Bill is well known to all Irishmen, and I am sure that Ireland has no better friend than he. He has never belonged to any large party in Irish politics. Not infrequently he votes with us against those whom he regularly supports on the other side of the House. It is, therefore, with some surprise that I saw the notice of his Motion on the Paper. I cannot pretend to forecast what are the reasons which he will give for such a drastic recommendation. I think it is in respect of the finance of the Bill that he desires its rejection. If so, we shall hear that is his reason, and other speakers on this side will have to give the best reply they can. But, at any rate, I hope your Lordships as a whole will not be induced to reject this measure. It is difficult to say what the results of such a rejection would be on the situation in Ireland. They must be, at any rate, very grave. We shall expect criticisms, possibly severe criticisms, in Committee. There are points on which I hope we may be able to meet the fears and criticisms of noble Lords opposite; but I do venture to warn the House that to reject the Bill would be an act of very great gravity indeed, and I implore your Lordships, at any rate, to read it a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<col>404</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01457"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member>, who had given notice, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move, "That the Bill be read 2<sup>a</sup> this day three months," said: My Lords, it is obvious, from the closing words of the noble Earl, that the course I am taking in moving the rejection of the Bill appears to him to be an extreme one, and it is quite probable that your Lordships in general will adopt that view. I can assure the House that in taking this course I am not acting on any sudden impulse or without due thought. The noble Earl has said quite truly that I have very often voted with noble Lords on the other side of the House on Irish subjects, and I regret exceedingly that in the matter of this Bill my opinion of what is necessary for the welfare of Ireland differs absolutely and entirely from the estimate formed by His Majesty's Government. This Bill has been before the country for close upon a year. I have studied the Bill to the best of my ability, and have come to the conclusion that it would be absolutely disastrous to Ireland. I have over and over again expressed that opinion publicly&#x2014;as publicly as I could&#x2014;and if I were to accept the principles of the Bill by agreeing to the Second Reading without making the strongest protest I could against it I should really be stultifying the opinion I now hold, the opinion I have always held, and every word I have said in public about the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01458">Your Lordships will, I am sure, do me the credit at any rate of believing that it is not without due thought or with a light heart that I have adopted this course. I have done so because it seems to me the only absolutely honest and straightforward course that I can possibly adopt. I do not say that there are not good points in the Bill. There are some good points in it. In the first place, it remedies what I must venture to call the technical error in the Act of 1903 of charging excess stock upon the grants in aid of rates. Very naturally His Majesty's Government take to themselves a great deal of credit for doing so, but as a matter of fact responsible Statesmen on both sides have long ago agreed that it never could be intended and was absolutely impossible to charge losses on flotation upon the rates. I do not know how that came to be put into the Bill of 1903. I was, of course, in no way responsible for that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0209"/>
<col>405</col>
Bill. It may be as the noble Earl has suggested, that the House of Commons passed the Bill in such a hilarious condition that this protection of the Treasury was introduced into the Bill without any Member of the House of Commons taking any notice of it. Be that as it may, I think it must be agreed that it has never been supposed that this could be charged on the rates, and though I congratulate His Majesty's Government upon removing this blot in the Act of 1903 it was really a technical error, which would under any circumstances have to be removed. The Bill gives the Estates Commissioners power to protect the State and to protect tenants against intimidation or duress. The Bill recognises that compulsion may be necessary under certain circumstances, but I think the compulsory clauses of the Bill will not hold water for a moment. The Bill deals with the cases of future tenants. I do not mean to say that the methods employed in the Bill are the best, but the intention is good. These points, however, are mere details of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01459">The noble Earl opposite is perfectly right as to one of my objections. I think the financial basis of the Bill is unsound, and I think the whole main structure on which the Bill rests is unsound. I object to the Bill for three reasons. In the first place, it has come up to this House in a condition and under circumstances and at a time which are, to say the least, most unusual. The main objects of the Bill are to accomplish two things: to enable land purchase to go on in Ireland&#x2014;I believe the Bill will absolutely fail in that&#x2014;and to relieve congestion, and I am convinced it will equally fail to accomplish that also. As to my first point, will you consider for a moment the history of this Bill? It was brought in, I think, in November of last year, and dropped. It was revived this year, and eight and a-half hours only were given to the debate on Second Reading. It was taken in Committee on four days, including four half-days&#x2014;Fridays. The Bill consists of seventy two clauses containing the most controversial matter&#x2014;clauses not amending but repealing all the principal provisions that made the Act of of 1903 so gigantic a success, and forty-five hours were devoted to the all-important Committee stage in the other House of Parliament. I think fifty clauses were guillotined in batches, just as fast as
<col>406</col>
the tumbrils could bring them under the knife; and nearly all the other clauses were closured after what the most impartial critic must admit was a very short and perfunctory discussion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01460">I think I am not mistaken in saying that among the clauses that were. guillotined was the clause first introducing the principle of compulsion. Well, my Lords, compulsion may be right or wrong, it may be necessary or unnecessary, but however wise it may be, at any rate, the compulsory system is a complete and absolute innovation in a Land Purchase Act; and that a clause of that kind should have been guillotined without one word of discussion being allowed upon it, is almost reducing things to an absurdity. After the Committee stage of forty-five hours, there was no debate on Report, and there was a debate of four or five hours on Third Reading. This Bill has come up to this House really nothing but a bundle of decapitated and gagged clauses. It is not a small measure dealing with allotments or small holdings or enabling one or two enterprising farmers to acquire the fee simple of their farms. This is a Bill dealing with a great agrarian revolution, the transfer of the whole agricultural land of the country from one set of men to another. It deals with 150 or 180 millions of money; it affects the welfare of hundreds of thousands of families; the whole future progress and prosperity of Ireland depends upon it; and such a Bill, after only forty-five hours consideration in Committee in the House of Commons, is sent up to this House at the end of September, and we are asked to read it a second time. That is really reducing legislation by Parliament to the very verge, if not beyond the verge, of absurdity. That is one reason why I protest against the Bill being read a second time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01461">Now as to the Bill itself. What are the objects of the Bill? It deals with pending agreements; it provides, or attempts to provide, for future sales, and it aims, or pretends to aim, at the relief of congestion. Now as to the pending agreements. There is a sum of fifty-three millions which is owed to the landowners who have sold their land in Ireland, and who are waiting for their money, to the great loss and hardship of themselves and to the great loss and detriment of thousands of tenants who have bought from them. The
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0210"/>
<col>407</col>
noble Earl gave us a very interesting description&#x2014;which is not in the Bill&#x2014;of how the money is to be spent. I think he said two millions were to be given in cash, and two millions partly in cash and partly in stock. That is, four millions a year are to be devoted to paying off this debt. What it really comes to is this. Parliament is asked to make a composition with the creditors of the State. These men, urged by a great Act of Parliament, have sold their properties, relying on the good faith of Parliament, relying on what may be truly called a Parliamentary bond. They sold their properties to carry out a great national reform, and now we are asked to go to them and say: "We are very sorry, but we cannot pay you. We owe you a sovereign. Please take sixteen shillings." Of course we can also say: "You can get your pound if you like to wait long enough." But it really comes to this: "We offer you sixteen shillings in the pound, and we strongly advise you to take it, because if you do not take it, you may wait ten, fifteen or twenty years; you may have to wait an indefinite period, until in fact it suits the convenience of the Treasury to pay you, and in the meantime you will be ruined." I do not think that is honourable, I do not think it is honest, and it is not creditable to this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01462">As to the future arrangements, this Bill does not amend&#x2014;it repeals all the principal provisions of the Act of 1903&#x2014;all the provisions that made that Act the most successful Act of land purchase that was ever passed for Ireland, and I think I might say the most beneficial Act of any kind that has ever been passed for Ireland. I need not describe what the Act has done. I daresay your Lordships know as well as I do that in about five years the number of holdings that have been bought under that Act is more than four times the number purchased under all the other Acts during the last twenty-five years. That Act is an unparalleled success, and to what is that success due? It is due to a system of voluntary agreement, to the system of payment in cash, to the low annuity rate, to a generous bonus and to the zones. Every one of those provisions is absolutely annulled in the present Bill. The Bill introduces compulsion, I maintain, instead of the present voluntary system. The noble Earl who introduced the Bill has told us that the Government did not desire to see compulsion largely used.
<col>408</col>
They only want to enforce it in comparatively few cases, and he used as an argument the fact that if it was used to a large extent it would completely do away with any necessity for issuing the three per cent. Stock for the satisfaction of voluntary sales. What may be the wish and desire and intention of His Majesty's Government I do not know All I can go by is what is in the Bill, and the Bill provides that compulsion may be universally applied. The noble Earl has described exactly what will happen. The Bill will abolish voluntary agreements and payment in stock altogether, and your issue of three per cent. Stock will become absolutely useless because no one will take it. Sellers will prefer compulsion and cash.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01463">I am not myself at all terrified by the word compulsion. It does not make me quiver or quake in my shoes. If this Government or any Government were to say: "We wish to see this great and beneficial revolution completed in Ireland; we are going to put an end to this delay and will finish off the business in the next five years. We will have universal compulsory sales; we shall give large preliminary powers to the Estates Commissioners; we will send round a strong judicial tribunal to revise and hear appeals and we will pay cash down on the nail," I should applaud it, and say "By all means do." And I quite agree with the noble Earl opposite that if land would not be sold simply out of what may be called "sheer cussedness," and a great and salutary revolution is to be thereby impeded and interrupted, I think such a state of things would be absolutely intolerable. I go further than that, and I admit that as regards the relief of congestion, if land is required in the immediate neighbourhood of a congested area and is held up, not for a fair price, but for an excessive price, simply because of the necessity to get the land, I think compulsion ought to be used. After all, compulsion is used in a great many cases, and I know no object in which compulsory powers could be more legitimately asked for or could be more legitimately applied than in relieving the condition of the people in what have been truly described as the agricultural slums in the west of Ireland. If land is required for that purpose and will not be sold but is held up to endeavour to get an excessive price,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0211"/>
<col>409</col>
merely because it is urgently required for that purpose, I should be quite in favour of its being compulsorily acquired. But this Bill does not confine itself to anything of that kind. It goes a great deal further. With all due respect, I say that these compulsory clauses in the Bill are really unworkable and ridiculous except in the cases where they would be fatal. The Estates Commissioners in their own two-thirds of Ireland, and at the instance of the Congested Districts Board in their own one-third, can exercise compulsory powers upon any landowner if his tenants or anyone else make him any kind of an offer. That is to say, if anybody chooses to offer a landlord in Ireland a penny an acre for his land, he could be compulsorily turned out. Surely that is ridiculous.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01464">But there are much worse matters than that. As I read the Bill I think I am right in saying that the Estates Commissioners, either themselves or acting for the Congested Districts Board, can compulsorily acquire property under whatever kind of tenure it is held, whether it was purchased the day before yesterday under the 1903 Act, or whether it has been inherited since the days of Adam. The Estates Commissioners can declare any piece of land to be an estate. You give them power to enter upon any estate and value the land, to put their own price upon it, and compel the owner, subject only to an appeal to the judicial commission, to take that price and evict him. This applies under this Bill to every single tenant who has purchased under the 1903 Act or any other Act. That is eviction made easy with a vengeance. I dare say I shall be told that we must trust to the discretion of the Estates Commissioners, that they would never think of doing anything of the kind. I have the greatest confidence in the Estates Commissioners, but after all, they are only human, and even if they are gods, they are not immortal gods. I do not know who their successors may be, and in any case, I absolutely protest against handing over the fortunes and destinies of all these people in Ireland to any individual, I do not care who he is. And that is what the Bill does. It enables any one Commissioner to transact any business that the three Commissioners can, and gives him power to compulsorily acquire any lands except those specially mentioned in the Bill, such as a demesne, and home
<col>410</col>
farms, and things of that kind. I would like to ask His Majesty's Government which of these two systems they want themselves. Do they want the voluntary system, or do they want the compulsory system, because it is absolutely impossible that you can have both. You cannot have a voluntary system and payment in depreciated stock going on alongside with a compulsory system and payment in cash. That is impossible. The voluntary system has answered very well. It has answered so well that we have run up to fifty-three millions of arrears on account of its success. If His Majesty's Government desire to supersede that by compulsion, on the grounds that the arrears will not hereafter accumulate, I think they will find themselves mistaken. It will pay every seller so much better to be bought out compulsorily. It is perfectly true that he does not get the usual ten per cent. additional price on account of compulsion, but he does get cash, which may be equal to ten per cent., and he gets his bonus. No one will want to come to voluntary agreements. If a man's tenants are perfectly ready to offer him a fair price it will pay him better to say "No," and be compelled to sell, and to get the price in cash. What will invariably happen under this Bill as it stands is that voluntary agreements will cease altogether. Sales under compulsion will go on, and the Estates Commissioners will not have any cash to satisfy them; you will run into arrears again, and in the course of another few years you will have another block or deadlock such as that which has occurred, because you have not been able to finance the Act of 1903 up to now. So much for the compulsory clauses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01465">Now, my Lords, to take another point. Stock is to be substituted for cash. I have the strongest objection to that. Cash is the only sound basis for payment. Surely in a great transaction of this kind it is essential that there shall be something like uniformity and stability of price and of terms and of everything that has to do with sale and purchase. Stocks must fluctuate; they do fluctuate, and they sometimes vary over considerable periods of time, and every large fluctuation of stock must give rise to a certain amount of dispute between landlord and tenant as to prices. The substitution of stock for cash would not lead to peace in Ireland, even if the landlords could accept stock, and I
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0212"/>
<col>411</col>
do not see how it is possible that they could. If your Lordships will consider that under this Bill buyers have got to pay a higher annuity, the grant-in-aid is very largely diminished, sellers have to take depreciated stock, you will see that this Bill opens a gap between the landlord and tenant of at least five years purchase, and that will stop land transfer. The annuity rate is to be increased. I think that is exceedingly foolish. I do not mean to say that the difference of a quarter per cent. in the case of an average holding in Ireland is in itself a very important matter. Of course it is not. But the principle is all wrong. It cannot be right, it cannot be sound, that one half of the tenants in Ireland should be paying one rate of interest, and the other half another rate of interest. It may not have any immediate effect, but surely we ought to look to the future. The present generation may understand it, but a future generation will say, "Why in the name of goodness are we paying more interest than our neighbours?" And it will be a sore temptation to them to say, "There is no reason why we should, and we will not."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01466">Now let me turn to the clauses dealing with congestion. The only good thing of the Bill, in my eyes, is that it is more generous in the matter of money, and I think His Majesty's Government deserve great credit for that. What does the Bill do? It practically dissolves the old Congested Districts Board, and creates a new Board with a very largely increased area, some of which is not congested at all, with greatly increased powers and with a brand-new administrative system. Well, I am not going into any great details in this matter. I object to the Congested Districts Board first of all on the ground that it is mere surplusage and totally unnecessary. Ireland is completely eaten up by Departments, boarded over with Boards. These Departments and Boards all overlap each other. They are engaged in doing the same or similar work. They are very expensive and inefficient, their inefficiency being largely due to redundancy. As some of your Lordships at any rate know, in my opinion you never will have economic and efficient administration in Ireland until the people of Ireland have themselves much more direct control than they have now over the administration of their own affairs. But that is not the question now.
<col>412</col>
We have to deal with a state of things as it is, and as things are I cannot see the sense of creating a Board larger and much more expensive than that which already exists. For dealing with land alone in Ireland there are about eight Departments and Offices and Boards, costing, as far as I can make out, about &#x00A3;407,000 a year&#x2014;about &#x00A3;1 per head for every small agricultural holding in Ireland&#x2014;an expensive luxury. What is the use of perpetuating the Congested Districts Board and making it larger? What are the functions of the Board?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01467">To put it very shortly they are to buy and improve and sell land, to ameliorate the condition of the people by introducing better stock, by teaching them small handicrafts, assisting them in fisheries and all matters of that kind. All these functions surely come right within the sphere of two other Departments&#x2014;the Estates Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. I think it will be universally admitted that in the matter of the sale and purchase and disposition of land the Estates Commissioners have been much more successful than the Congested Districts Board. They have got more land, and they have got it cheaper. As to the other functions of the Board, certainly they could be fulfilled just as well, and perhaps better, by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, which includes fisheries. As a matter of fact I think they would be conducted better. The Congested Districts Board has done very good work. There is no question about that. So has the Department of Agriculture. But there is a difference in the methods of the two. The Congested Districts Board helps the people, but at the same time teaches them to rely upon the Board. The Department of Agriculture helps the people, but teaches them rather to help themselves and to rely upon themselves, and the method adopted by the Department of Agriculture is by far the best for improving the social and economic and the moral and physical condition of the people. I cannot conceive why a transference of the duties of the Congested Districts Board has not been made to the Estates Commissioners and to the Department of Agriculture; but His Majesty's Government have taken just the opposite course. They have increased the Congested Districts Board; they have largely extended its area; they have given it a great deal more power, and they have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0213"/>
<col>413</col>
given it an elected element. I do not think the efficiency of the Board will be increased by that elected element.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01468">We are always told&#x2014;we have been told tonight&#x2014;that to doubt the efficiency of an elected Board of that kind is rather insulting to the Irish people. We are asked to look at the admirable way in which the county councils have done their work. I know that the county councils have done their work admirably. I ought to know, because I have been a member of a county council for nine years. They have done their work extraordinary well, but there is absolutely no analogy whatever between their duties and the duties of the elected Board proposed in this Bill. The members of the county councils are ratepayers, and the electors are ratepayers. They are spending their own money and the money of their constituents, and if there is a fault to find with the county councils it is that, especially before elections, they are apt to be too parsimonious. But the elected members of this Board will not be spending their own money or the money of their constituents. They will be spending somebody else's money, and they will be elected in order to get as much as they possibly can for the district they represent, and the more they spend, not the less they spend, the more popular will they be, and the more likely will they be to be re-elected. You would never dream of entrusting in this country the duties which this Board will have to fulfil to administrative machinery of the kind you propose for Ireland. You have not done it in the case of the Development Fund. You appoint Commissioners. I would like to make one quotation and remind you of what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said on that point. Speaking on the Committee stage of the Development Bill, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said&#x2014;
<quote>"He did not think they would get the right type of Commissioners on the nomination of Chambers of Commerce or Agriculture or similar bodies. Under such a plan there would be a scramble between the various bodies and afterwards a scramble between the Commissioners themselves in the interests of the bodies who nominated them. They wanted Commissioners who would exercise their functions judicially."</quote>
And a little later on he said&#x2014;
<quote>"My view is that the more detached these Commissioners are, the more reliable they will be, and the better they will do their work."</quote>
<col>414</col>
Every word of that pregnant sentence is applicable to Ireland to the same extent, and to a greater extent, than it is in England. There is no disguising the fact that bodies of this kind are more subject to political and other pressure in Ireland than in England. I do not so much mean politics in the larger sense. I mean small local politics, local parties, local social pressure, the influence of local leaders. You will be putting these elected members in a most cruelly difficult position. You must remember they will be in a working majority on the Board, because neither the Chief Secretary nor the Under-Secretary will be able very constantly to attend. You are saying to this Board, "Here is a million of money a year for you to spend in land purchase. You have to satisfy the claims of the 'congests' out of that, and also the claims of the 'landless men.' And here is a quarter of a million for you to spend in improvements"&#x2014;that is to say, to a very large extent, naturally, in charity. "We are not going to give you any instructions about the 'landless man' or the 'congests' as to which of them ought to get the money. Go home and scramble for it and fight it out among yourselves." I have not the slightest doubt that these nine elected members in Ireland will do their duty as honestly and as efficiently as any other nine men in any other part of the Kingdom, but you are putting them in an absolutely impossible position. They will be subjected to unfair influences. Their attention will be concentrated upon details instead of upon the problem as a whole. They cannot administer the money in the way it ought to be administered; that can only be done by a strong and absolutely independent body like you propose for the Development Fund.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01469">Handing over the congested districts to machinery of this kind is absolutely certain to lead to disappointment; disappointment will lead to discontent, and discontent to disorder. In creating this large area which you have given to a Board supplied with most inadequate machinery, you are only making a breeding place for disorder and agitation which can be utilised whenever it suits anybody to say that there ought to be agitation in Ireland for political or for any other reasons. And was not the problem of congestion difficult enough before? Now it has become more complicated on account of the landless man
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0214"/>
<col>415</col>
the noble Lord spoke of. I do not pretend to know the origin of the landless man. I know he exists, and that he is exceedingly inconvenient. Congestion can be relieved only by accretion or substitution or addition of land, where possible, or the substitution of one holding for another. For that purpose every acre of untenanted land that is available is necessary. For that land this new claimant has arisen. The theory is that comparatively large areas of grass lands should be broken up into comparatively small holdings devoted to tillage and should be given to men who have no land, and who would like to have some&#x2014;not at all an uncommon complaint in Ireland. I am not arguing whether this is wise or foolish, economically sound or unsound. Assume that this new plantation is an excellent idea&#x2014;that the land can be planted with capable men; even so, my point, and my only point, is that it is absolutely impossible for you to do both these things. You can not relieve congestion and provide for the landless man at the same time, and I want to know which His Majesty's Government desire to do. You cannot shelve this question on to this unfortunate elected Board. They cannot settle it. That is a matter that must be settled by His Majesty's Government. If you want to relieve congestion, say so in your Bill, and ear-mark every acre you can get until you have relieved congestion; but then you cannot satisfy the claims of the lacklanders. If, on the other hand, you mean to satisfy the claims of the landless man, say so in your Bill; but then you cannot satisfy the claims of the "congests;" your Bill will be a cruel fraud upon the unfortunate people in the congested districts; and in so far as you ask for public money for the relief of congestion and apply it to another purpose your Bill will be very little short of a fraud on the public.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01470">My Lords, I think I have now mentioned the principal counts in my indictment against the Bill. I think a composition with her creditors is not creditable to the country. In my opinion the compulsory clauses are fatal in some respects and unintelligible in others. Your proposals for the relief of congestion are absolutely bound to fail. I am sure interference with title in the way the Bill does&#x2014;that is, the title to land purchased&#x2014;will be absolutely fatal. Once you throw even a shadow of doubt upon
<col>416</col>
the absolute integrity and sanctity of a purchasing tenant's title, you may give up all hope of regeneration in Ireland. Ownership will cease to charm to effort; you will do away with all sense of security and the certainty that a man has that he will reap the fruit of his own labour himself, you will destroy the whole object of land purchase. For the evil system of dual ownership you will be substituting an infinitely worse system. Every farmer in Ireland will hold at the will of a tribunal of one, or at most three, Estates Commissioners; and you will create such a sense of insecurity in Ireland that you will absolutely stop any possibility of progress in the country, and reduce it to a state of chaos from which you will never be able to extricate it again. Those are my principal points. There are other important points, of course, such as the zones, the bonus, and so on. I do not want to touch upon them except, perhaps, to say that, like all the rest of the Bill, the bonus as arranged is entirely in the interests of the Treasury. The whole Bill, from the Preamble to the last Schedule, is a Treasury Relief Bill and nothing else. It takes no consideration for the tenants or the landlords or anybody but the Treasury. If you will look at the Schedule you will see that it will pay a seller better to exact the highest price mentioned and receive no bonus than to sell at the lowest price and receive the largest bonus. The Schedule is an instruction to the landlord to stand out for the higher price; however charming that may be for the Treasury, it is not at all pleasant for the tenant to contemplate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01471">I have occupied the attention of your Lordships at inordinate length. The only excuse I can make is that the Act of 1903 has worked such miracles in Ireland and that this Act destroys it. If you could only see how in a few short years the whole face of the country has changed where the Act has been fairly in operation, you could understand, at any rate, with what dismay I and any man who has the real interests of Ireland truly at heart looks upon a Bill which tears that Act to shreds. And what was the necessity for this great and retrograde change? On the Third Reading of the Bill in another place the Attorney-General gave a reason for compulsion, and the Chief Secretary gave a reason for the Bill. The Attorney-General said that compulsion was neces-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0215"/>
<col>417</col>
sary. I am not quoting his words, but the effect of what he said. He said compulsion was necessary because the Act of 1903 had succeeded very well in the East, where rich and prosperous landlords had sold to rich and prosperous tenants, but it had been a failure in the West. The Attorney-General is quite mistaken. If he had looked at the Estates Commissioners' last report he would see that in County Cork alone 17,944 purchases had taken place. In Limerick, Tipperary, and Kerry there had been 28,122 purchases. About twenty millions worth of property has changed hands in those Western and Southern Counties under the Act. I think it possible that the Attorney-General was thinking of the County of Mayo. In Mayo the Act has been a lamentable failure. In that county there are only 1,181 purchases recorded. But the Attorney-General may have forgotten what I dare say your Lordships will recollect, that one of the members for the County of Mayo has exercised all his powers and strength and influence for the last five or six years in endeavouring to wreck the Act of 1903. Speaking, I think, about three years ago, Mr. Dillon said&#x2014;
<quote>"I wish to Heaven we had the power to obstruct the smooth working of the Act more than we did. It has worked smoothly; far too smoothly for my mind."</quote>
I must congratulate the hon. member on his most lamentable success. By himself he succeeded in wrecking the Land Bill in County Mayo, and with the assistance of His Majesty's Government, he will, if this Bill passes, succeed in wrecking it over the whole of Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01472">The Chief Secretary's reason for the Bill was that the Act of 1903, the financial part of it, was "smashed beyond all repair." I am not going into financial matters, but I beg leave to doubt that the Act of 1903 is smashed beyond all repair. The House of Commons had no opportunity, or was allowed no opportunity, of considering the financial proposals in this Bill or of making suggestions or moving Amendments. It is not within the province of your Lordships' House to do so, and therefore there is no use or sense in discussing the matter, but I decidedly doubt that the finances of the 1903 Act have absolutely and hopelessly broken down. And I entirely demur to the statement that the only substitute for those financial proposals are the proposals that find a place in this Bill.
<col>418</col>
One thing at any rate is perfectly certain, that if the Chief Secretary to the Lieutenant-Governor could have obtained authority, which he certainly will not get from the noble Earl opposite, to whisper one little word "Consols," he would not have found it hard to repair the smash. I never could understand the reason, and I never shall understand, why, when a large sum of money is wanted for a great national purpose and is secured upon the Consolidated Fund of the country, it should not be added to the Consolidated Debt of the country. That passes my comprehension, particularly when the objects sought could be accomplished by that means, and apparently cannot be accomplished without it. The noble Earl opposite spoke of amateurish views on this subject. I would remind him that a good deal of opinion which he could not call amateur opinion was expressed in another place on the subject of Consols, and that in a division His Majesty's Government, with a normal majority of over three hundred, had only a majority of eight. Of coure, I admit that Parliament in passing the Act of 1903 gave no absolute bond. Parliament cannot give a bond. What Parliament says to-day it can unsay to-morrow. But if ever Parliament gave an honourable undertaking that if an Act worked well and satisfactorily it would fulfil its obligations and finance the Act&#x2014;if ever such an undertaking was made, it was made and on the part of all parties by Parliament in passing the Act of 1903. Six years ago Parliament put Ireland on a fair footing of prosperity. Is it fair to falsify all the hopes of the people of Ireland by refusing to fulfil our promises and cancelling an honourable undertaking? The Act has been a success. Nobody can dispute or deny that. The tenants have paid their instalments honourably and punctually, the benefit that it was stipulated at the Land Conference they should receive they have received. It was stipulated for them that they should receive a substantial reduction in their rents, and they have received that reduction. All parties have fulfilled their part of the contract except the State. Is that honest, is it honourable, is it not a bad example to set the Irish people? To use a merely material argument, you may be sure of this, that to carry on land purchase in Ireland, even if it were to cost &#x00A3;640,000 a year, as the noble Earl said, would be cheaper than letting it stop.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01476"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: Yes, but the Government's estimate of the amount required for land purchase is greatly exaggerated. I do not know what the bonus is intended to be under the Bill, because there is no amount mentioned, only percentage. In my opinion the bonus should be kept up to twelve per cent.; that would require about another &#x00A3;3,000;000 or &#x00A3;4,000,000. Put the total amount at &#x00A3;640,000, or &#x00A3;740,000; such a sum is not an enormous sum in view of a Budget going up to &#x00A3;160,000,000 or &#x00A3;170,000,000. I believe it would be cheaper to carry on land purchase even if it cost that amount than to have it blocked and stopped. With land purchase completed, the Land Commission and the Estates Commissioners and the Land Judges' Court would, of course, cease. They would have nothing more to do. With a contented and a peaceful Ireland you could make very large savings in many directions. And you may believe me that a discontented Ireland is a very expensive luxury, to use Lord Rosebery's expression. I shall be told that if this Bill is rejected there will be trouble. That has been in fact promised. I suppose there will be. It is very easy to say what ought to have been done considering the abnormal session that we are undergoing. If His Majesty's Government had brought in a Bill of a single clause relieving the rates of what everybody admits they ought to be relieved of&#x2014;namely, the charge for excess stock&#x2014;land purchase would have gone on very comfortably and quietly. The Treasury could have continued paying off arrears for a year or two until, at any rate, the other House of Parliament had a proper opportunity of giving appropriate consideration to a Bill of this kind. I do not know whether if the Bill is rejected there will be trouble. But if the Bill is passed, with all its imperfections full upon it, I am sure there will be trouble
<col>420</col>
also. I do not know which will be the lesser of the two evils.<lb/>
My Lords if you think the Bill can be amended and put into anything like a satisfactory shape, no doubt your Lordships will give it a Second Reading and endeavour to amend it; but I am bound to confess that I am not sanguine that you can do that. I am sure that I can credit His Majesty's Government with the very best intentions in this Bill, but I am afraid their good intentions will lead them where good intentions are generally supposed to lead. I am absolutely certain of this, that if a man were to sit down to devise a plan for blocking land purchase, for causing friction and disorder, for putting an end to the progress that Ireland is now slowly making, and to all chance of future prosperity, I do not believe he could invent a better instrument for his purpose than is to be found within the four corners of this Bill. That being my opinion, I have taken what I think is the only course I could take, and that is to move its rejection. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

My noble friend took a conspicuous, and I hope I may add a very honourable, part in the negotiations which in 1903 brought about an arrangement with regard to the Irish land question which certainly seemed to many of us to open a new era of hope. It must be profoundly mortifying to my noble friend to see the settlement to which he was a party battered and undermined, as I am bound to say it seems to me to be, by the proposals of this Bill. I should have been disposed to vote with him, but for a reason which, curiously enough, was one of the reasons he gave for desiring to throw out the Bill. He mentioned that the measure has never been adequately discussed elsewhere. In this House we shall have full opportunity of discussing it, and I cannot bring myself to believe that when we do so noble Lords opposite will be entirely impervious to the arguments we shall be able to bring forward.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0217"/>
<col>421</col>
Indeed, I noted with satisfaction an expression made use of by the noble Earl which seems to justify my expectation, for I think he told us that he was not without hope of being able to disarm our fears or meet our wishes on several points in the Bill.<lb/>
The Bill is certainly anything but a mere amplification or development of the Act of 1903. It differs from it in its origin and the policy by which it is inspired. The Bill of 1903 arose out of a conference in which both sides did their best to come to reasonable and honourable terms. This Bill has its origin in the Report of a Royal Commission in which I think one may say without disrespect that the big battalions were entirely on one side, and not only is that the case, but this Bill goes far beyond the recommendations of the Dudley Commission. There are other differences. The Bill of 1903 was founded on voluntary sale; this Bill is founded on compulsion. The Bill of 1903 offered terms that were attractive to both parties; this Bill offers terms which, I am afraid, will be attractive to neither. The Bill of 1903 afforded a fair promise that it would bring to an end that continuous litigation which has been the curse of Ireland during the last few years; this Bill opens up a new vista of litigation. Finally, while the Bill of 1903 offered great relief to those public departments concerned in the administration of these questions, this Bill contains provisions which obviously will add enormously to the obligations and responsibilities and work of those departments. Therefore, my Lords, it is a mere mockery of words to represent this Bill as merely a legitimate consequence of the Bill of 1903.<lb/>
I noticed that the noble Earl devoted more than half his speech to the discussion of the purchase provisions to be found in the earlier part of the Bill. I am not going to follow his example. I may say that I greatly regret that these provisions should not be more favourable than they are. The tenant's annuity is to be raised, the landlord is to be paid in stock instead of in cash, the bonus is to be reduced, and the long delay which has already discouraged people so much is, so far as we can see, not to be reduced. All these are serious impediments in the way of land purchase in Ireland. But I am bound to admit that the noble Earl did show, and I think, showed conclusively, that the time has come
<col>422</col>
when some reconsideration of the financial terms of 1903 has become inevitable. I do not pretend to any expert knowledge of these matters, and I will therefore confine myself to saying that I am very far from convinced that the financial arrangements contained in this Bill are the only financial arrangements which could be devised for the purpose of extricating us from the undoubted difficulty with which we are confronted. I believe there are other solutions of the problem, and I believe that it will pay you, and pay you well, to deal generously with it.<lb/>
I pass from that to other clauses of the Bill. In the first place, there is the manner in which it deals with the zones. The zones were the bed-rock of the measure of 1903, and it is really almost superfluous to enlarge on the advantages which they offer. The tenant under the zones receives a liberal reduction of an already liberally reduced rent. The landlord is secured reasonable terms. As for the State, the measure of the advantages given to the tenant is also the measure of the security obtained by the State. That this is no idle opinion is, I think, conclusively proved when one remembers that as lately as July in this year out of no less than 60,000 purchasing tenants in Ireland, only 463 were in arrear with the payment of their interest. Why are we to throw over the zones? Because, in spite of all the assurances of the noble Earl, I maintain that this Bill does throw over the zones. The noble Earl gave us several explanations. I think one or two of his explanations were not, perhaps, quite seriously intended. He told us that it was necessary to have the power of going outside the zones because in some cases the farmers' holdings had been carried away by landslides. In the House of Commons the Chief Secretary said that what he had in his mind was the erosion of the tenants' holdings by alterations in the Irish coast line. Seriously, are we to break down a clause which was the essence of the settlement of 1903 in order to provide for such frivolous and negligible exceptions as those which I have cited?<lb/>
But there are other reasons assigned. We are told that in some cases considerable sums have been added to the purchase money in liquidation of arrears due by the tenants. Well, I believe that to be a very arguable point. If a landlord, to whom
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0218"/>
<col>423</col>
his tenant owes a couple of years arrears, says to that tenant, "I will sell to you for twenty years purchase of your rent and say no more about the arrears," I cannot see that that is a very criminal or reprehensible transaction. But I am sure that my noble friends from Ireland are quite ready to meet His Majesty's Government on that point, and if they desire to put into this Bill words restricting the addition of arrears beyond a certain limit to the purchase money, that seems to me to be a very reasonable solution of the difficulty. But if that is what the noble Earl wants, let him put it into his Bill, and let us know where we are. But do not let us have the zones torn up merely because the Estates Commissioners desire to have certain powers which they do not enjoy at present for dealing with cases where there is reason to question the <i>bona fides</i> of the transaction. At any rate it seems to me most unfair to impose this new element of uncertainty upon the contracting parties, and not less unfair to impose this new obligation upon the Commissioners who will have to administer this Bill. I should like very much to be told by some one who will speak on the other side of the House whether the Estates Commissioners themselves advise his Majesty's Government that a clause of this kind is really necessary in order to make the law water-tight.<lb/>
Then I pass to the seventeenth clause, the clause in which we certainly believe that we have detected an intention to provide free access for the landless men, who are sometimes better known as cattle-drivers, to the benefits of the Act of 1903. The proposal to provide for the landless men by purchasing estates for their benefit was pulverised by the Dudley Commission. It was pointed out by that Commission that the primary effect of any policy of this kind would be to place an effectual obstacle in the way of what was the real and main object of the Commission&#x2014;I mean the relief of congestion. I object to this proposal also upon the ground that, if it is adopted, it cannot fail to be most embarrassing to the Estates Commissioners. They will have not only the congested portion of the population on their hands, they will have these other claimants who, in my humble opinion, have no title whatever to the assistance which they desire to obtain. The noble Earl gave us the history of this
<col>424</col>
problem, and he told us that it never would have arisen but for certain provisions for which we on this side of the House were responsible in the Act of 1903. I believe it to be most unjust to the authors of the Act of 1903 to saddle them with any responsibility for the policy of giving land to the landless men. In the Act of 1903 there are two provisions, and two provisions only, which, by any stretch of language, can be interpreted as designed to afford relief to the landless men. There is the second clause, which is strictly limited to the sons of tenants on the estate and to small farmers under &#x00A3;5 rent in the neighbourhood of the estate. That is the limitation in regard to sales carried out through the Estates Commissioners. In regard to sales carried out through the Congested Districts Board the only provision dealing with the point is limited in its application to the tenants who are adjacent to the estate which is being transferred and who are, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, themselves congests.</membercontribution></p>

But what I should like to enforce is this, that in the Act of 1903 we were dealing with voluntary sales, and voluntary sales alone. The case is entirely altered when you import into the transaction this new element of compulsion. I hope we shall take the noble Earl at his word, and if he really does intend to limit this seventeenth clause to those exceptional cases which he described to us&#x2014;if he only wants power to deal with the little houses surrounded by laurel bushes which he described in such picturesque language&#x2014;I hope he will draw the clause in his Bill so that the power which he really wants, and not the much wider powers which the clause as it stand undoubtedly confers, will be given. I do not think I am beyond the mark in saying that, if the clause should remain as it stands, it will be possible to bring crofters from the Outer Hebrides and establish them on untenanted land in Ireland.<lb/>
I wish to say one word upon the important question of compulsion. On this
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0219"/>
<col>425</col>
point the Bill departs very widely from the Report of the Dudley Commission. I am far from desiring to take up the position that in this or in any other part of the United Kingdom we can altogether object upon principle to the exercise of compulsion when compulsion is exercised for some useful public purpose. But surely it is necessary whenever you desire to obtain permission to exercise compulsory powers, to show that some kind of case exists for making that demand. I venture to submit to the House that we have had nothing like a case for compulsion, either restricted or unrestricted, put before Parliament. The Commissioners have already more land than they can handle; they have more land than they can pay for, and there is land in abundance to be had if they set to work in the right way to obtain it. I heard of a remarkable case which, I believe, is authentic. I am assured that through private negotiations something like 12,000 acres of land which the Commissioners had themselves designated as being suitable for their purposes were offered by the owners to the Commissioners, who declined the offer because they had no money with which to pay for it. What is the use of coming to us and saying that compulsion is necessary when the facts are as I have described?<lb/>
Our suspicions are, I think, pardonable. We know something of the manner in which these compulsory powers are to be exercised. All that is necessary, to use the language of the Bill, is that negotiations shall have been entered into between landlord and tenant. If a tenant or the parish priest goes to the landlord and offers twelve years purchase, that is negotiation; and the next step is the final offer made by the Commissioners, with an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner whose verdict is conclusive. In this case, as in other cases which we have recently discussed in this House, you have the very common spectacle of a supreme department driving the coach as furiously as it pleases, and then deciding what compensation is to be paid to the unfortunate people whom it happens to run over. There are other circumstances which justify suspicion. We have from time to time obtained indications of the sort of terms which would be accorded to those whose property might be taken from them compulsorily. We know that, in the view of the Commissioners, it
<col>426</col>
would be their business to buy land on a basis which would enable them to resell it. It is not a question what the land is worth to the proprietor; it is a question of the kind of bargain which can be made between the new proprietors and the Commissioners when the question of resale arises. In the Bill itself there is a clause which directs the Commissioners to have regard not to the intrinsic value of the estate but to the price which tenants and others are willing to give. A man has property which is worth a certain sum. What right have you, in taking it away, to be guided, not by the value, but by what somebody else who is waiting round the corner is willing to give you for it?<lb/>
There is another very remarkable feature about this proposal for universal compulsion. The vendors who are compelled to sell are to be paid in cash and to have priority over other vendors. What an extraordinary proposal! You have one owner who is as you put it "reasonable" and ready to come to terms with his tenants. He may have to wait ten years, and he is paid in stock which is worth considerably below its face value. You have another owner described by the noble Earl as the cantankerous man; he is to be paid in cash and paid immediately. Could any paradox be more extraordinary?<lb/>
If we are told that compulsion is to be so very rarely exercised, how do you get this enormous and inflated figure of &#x00A3;180,000,000 to cover future purchase transactions? I do not wish to be cynical, but I cannot help saying that these assurances of moderation, which I am sure are perfectly honest, must be a little discounted. The memory of the Evicted Tenants Bill is fresh in my recollection. Your Lordships will remember the assurances which were given to us then, and by no one more emphatically than by the noble Earl opposite, that the Bill was not intended to give relief to ordinary broken-down tenants but only to those who had lost their holdings in the "land war." If the noble Earl will inquire what has happened he will find that in a great many cases persons of that kind have been readmitted to their farms, and that the number of applicants, estimated by His Majesty's Government to be 2,000, has
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0220"/>
<col>427</col>
risen to 11,000, and that a great many of them have not been dealt with yet. We ask for some indication of the nature of these rare and exceptional cases in which compulsory powers are indispensable. Even if compulsion is exercised very rarely indeed, the mere fact that compulsion is there&#x2014;the existence of compulsory powers on the Statute-book&#x2014;deprives all transactions, even those which are voluntary in name, of their really voluntary character.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite made use of a most apposite expression in that connection. He spoke of having compulsion as a weapon in the background. Exactly! That weapon will be in the background, and every one will feel that it may fall upon his neck. I cannot help thinking that one can divine the reasons why the Government have not thought it altogether expedient to put upon the face of the Bill that they intend to use compulsion only in very rare and exceptional cases. A great deal more than that is expected of them by their Irish supporters, and it is my firm belief that if they do not specify a little more closely than they have done what they mean by compulsion in rare and exceptional cases, what they mean by departing from the zones in rare and exceptional cases, what they mean by dealing with landless men only when there is "the little house with the laurel bushes around it"&#x2014;the reason why they do not condescend to these particulars is because they know quite well that if they did, and if they put into the Bill a clear definition of what their intentions really are, they would have their Irish friends upon their back before they knew where they were. I have seen no case to justify either general compulsion or compulsion in special cases. If, however, the Government are able to show that certain lands in Ireland are really indispensable for the purpose of relieving congestion, that no other land is available, and that the owner has really no sufficient reason for his refusal to sell; if they can also provide us with a competent and impartial tribunal which shall decide as to the reasonableness of the demand and of the compensation offered, then we shall be glad to discuss with the noble Earl opposite whether compulsory powers carefully restricted in some such manner as I have suggested might not be inserted in the Bill.<lb/>
I pass to the proposals for the creation
<col>428</col>
of the new Congested Districts Board, and I will venture to say one word in regard to the question of congestion in Ireland. We are, I suppose, all aware that there are in some parts of Ireland areas where the people are much crowded on the land and where there is great poverty and misery, and we all desire that those areas should be dealt with in the most generous and humane manner; but I do entreat your Lordships to take what I would call a sober view of this problem. Above all things do not let us ignore the enormous improvement which has taken place, not only in other parts of Ireland, but even in the most congested parts during the last half-century. I do not believe that any part of the United Kingdom has made such rapid progress in the time as Ireland has. Since the middle of the eighteenth century the number of holdings below five acres&#x2014;that is, the smallest and most miserable holdings&#x2014;has diminished by no less than eighty per cent. It is also noteworthy that houses of the first and second classes&#x2014;that is, the better houses&#x2014;have exactly doubled in number, having increased from 300,000 to 600,000; while houses of the third class have diminished from half a million to a quarter of a million, and houses of the fourth class, the worst type of cabins, which then numbered half a million, now number 9,000 only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01481"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I ask if the noble Marquess's statistics are before the famine or after the famine?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01482"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: They start at the time of the famine&#x2014;the forties. That is a very great change. The noble Earl must also be aware that the people are better clothed and better fed than they have ever before been in the history of the country. Again, prices have risen, and while they were rising rents have been reduced by thirty or forty per cent. Then there is the recent development of old-age pensions; they have certainly mitigated in an extraordinary way the poverty of some of the poorest districts in Ireland. I cannot resist giving your Lordships one or two figures with regard to this point. The Poor Law Union of Belmullet, in County Mayo, has a Poor Law valuation in round figures of &#x00A3;11,000; the total amount of pensions already admitted is over &#x00A3;9,000, and there are several hundreds of cases still to be dealt with. In the Poor Law Union of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0221"/>
<col>429</col>
Swinford the Poor Law valuation is &#x00A3;42,000, the annual total of pensions admitted is almost exactly the same, and there are several hundreds of cases still to be dealt with. The whole of the poor Law Union of Belmullet is scheduled as congested, and nineteen out of the twenty-one electoral divisions of Swinford are scheduled as congested. What I want to call your Lordships' attention to is this. I am assured&#x2014;my noble friend Lord Mayo will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that the rent now paid in these parts of Ireland is usually somewhat under the Poor Law valuation. The noble Earl agrees with me; so that it comes to this, that these districts are receiving, in the shape of old-age pensions, a sum sufficient to pay the whole of the rental due to the landlords under whom they hold their farms. This surely does go to show that the question of congestion even in these remote places is becoming considerably less acute than it was some time ago.<lb/>
But I will give your Lordships another figure. I take the savings banks deposits, a return of which was lately laid on the Table of the House. It is remarkable, as showing the general prosperity of the country, that since 1881 the deposits in the Post Office savings banks have risen from &#x00A3;1,750,000 to &#x00A3;10,500,000. I have taken the trouble to take out the counties which are included under this Bill as congested counties, and I find, that not only is the increase in the savings banks deposits in these nine counties up to the level of the rest of Ireland, but that it has exceeded the rate of increase in other parts of Ireland. Deposits have increased sixfold over the whole of Ireland; in the nine counties which you are going to treat as abjectly poor and distressful they have increased sevenfold.<lb/>
I trouble your Lordships with these facts because I wish to raise my voice against the fallacy that what we are pleased to call an uneconomic holding, because the rental of it is below &#x00A3;10, is a holding the occupant of which is necessarily in a very miserable and impoverished state. Nothing of the kind. The man who pays a rent of &#x00A3;8 very likely has seven or eight head of cattle; he probably has some sheep; he probably has more land than he can till properly; he has free fuel not far from his door; and, altogether, I have no hesitation in saying
<col>430</col>
that he enjoys a bargain which would make some of our hard-working English cottagers who pay &#x00A3;5 or &#x00A3;6 a year for the use of a cottage and garden positively green with envy. And this is capable of proof, because we know that, when one of these small holdings comes into the market, the tenant right often sells for twenty, thirty, or even forty years purchase&#x2014;sums which are paid, not by the poor people in the neighbourhood, but very often by hard-headed men who come back from America and who know a good bargain when they see it. I dwell on these things because they do seem to me to show how dangerous it is to be induced by our genuine and natural desire to do all we can for the poorer parts of the Irish population to take short cuts and rash expedients which may land us we do not know where.<lb/>
Now one word as to the new Congested Districts Board. I quite admit that the noble Earl showed us this evening that some change in the present arrangement is called for. The Congested Districts Board has done much excellent work and enjoys a deservedly high reputation in many parts of Ireland. But since the Board was first formed many other things have happened. We have had the creation of the Department of Agriculture and Industries, and we have had the development of the Estates Commission under the Act of 1903; and the result has been that there is at this moment a great amount of confusion, of duplication of work, and, I will add, a great deal of extravagance, owing to the number of authorities who side by side compete with one another in the same parts of Ireland. Therefore I am quite ready to consider the propriety of a change, and I agree with the noble Earl when he suggests that the charge of Irish agriculture and industries should be transferred to the Board of Agriculture. But I own I cannot concur with him when he proposes that the whole of the land purchase and settlement work now done by the Estates Commissioners in the nine western counties should be handed over to the new Congested Districts Board.<lb/>
I think there is a great deal to be said for retaining within careful limits some system of what I would speak of as paternal administration for the districts which can properly be described as congested districts, and therefore, although it might be more logical and more symmetrical to get rid of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0222"/>
<col>431</col>
the Board altogether, and to divide its functions between the Estates Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture and Industries, I am quite ready to contemplate with equanimity the preservation of the Congested Districts Board in one shape or another. But I would suggest to the noble Earl that there are two principles which should be kept in view. In the first place, if you are to have this kind of paternal administration, try to confine it within the narrowest limits possible; and, in the second place, not only do that, but endeavour to establish a system which will bring about as rapidly as possible a condition of things in which the people will no longer look to paternal treatment, but will develop a spirit of self-reliance and will be able to shift for themselves.<lb/>
I take exception to the proposals in this Bill because it seems to me they do neither of these things. You enlarge the size of the congested districts; you drive the Estates Commissioners, who are a much more competent and much better equipped body than the Congested. Districts Board, out of a third of Ireland; and you establish in this new Board a system which, it seems to me, is likely to keep what I would call paternal administration in existence for an indefinite length of time and under conditions from which we are never likely to be able to extricate ourselves. In my view the machinery which you have set up for this purpose is the worst possible machinery that you could have invented for such an object. You are creating a large and unwieldy body, comprising nineteen members. Why is it that three members are sufficient for two-thirds of Ireland, and that you have nineteen members for the remaining one-third? The majority of them are to be elected, and to be elected by bodies not without their merits, which I freely acknowledge, but bodies of which their greatest admirers will not say that they are free from partisan spirit. You have only to see how they administer their affairs to be convinced of that. This large body is to be entrusted with the expenditure of immense sums of money, and with very large patronage. Patronage is, I think, always the stumbling-block of local bodies, and in Ireland particularly patronage is invariably the stumbling-block. I cannot conceive, when you are dealing with the particular sort of patronage which this Board will command&#x2014;I mean the transfer of land in
<col>432</col>
large quantities from one set of people to another set of people&#x2014;a body less well adapted to exercise patronage than this composite body, with its representative majority, which you are going to set up. I say therefore, with regard to this part of the Bill, speaking for myself, that while I am quite ready to co-operate with noble Lords opposite in putting an end to the confusion and overlapping which undoubtedly do exist at the present time as between these different boards, while I am quite ready to see proper provision made for the paternal and generous treatment of a certain particularly impoverished areas, I cannot bring myself to believe that the House will accept the extraordinary&#x2014;I would almost say the grotesque&#x2014;proposals to be found in this part of the Bill.<lb/>
There are other clauses to which I should have been glad to draw attention, but time does not permit me to do so. I will add only these two or three words upon the general aspect of the case. I am told that in the last twenty-five years there have been something like twenty-five Bills dealing in one form or another with the question of Irish land tenure. Is there never to be an end of this legislation? As for this particular Bill, I would like the House to consider what its ulterior effects on Ireland are likely to be. Let us think not only of the way in which it affects the pockets of landlords and tenants. Let us consider how it affects the prosperity of the Irish community. In a great part of Ireland you have, roughly speaking, only one industry, the industry of agriculture. Our national industries have thriven in the past because men have come to the front by their own energy and skill, and because the fittest of these men have emerged. In the rest of the United Kingdom that has been the case with the great industry of agriculture also. The tenant farmers of England and Scotland are men who, by a process of natural selection, have come to the front, and who, because they have been selected men, have surmounted the great difficulties with which agriculturists had to deal in recent years. But in Ireland the case has been wholly different. In Ireland under the present law, if a tenant farms his land badly his rent is reduced in order that it may suit the badness of his farming. If he cannot get through under these conditions, and has to give his holding up, he is reinstated, and not only reinstated,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0223"/>
<col>433</col>
but reinstated on his holding on conditions more favourable than those of his neighbour who has been punctual and hardworking.<lb/>
This Bill takes us further along the same disastrous course. You are not only going to drive out the landowner, but there are clauses which show that your desire is to get rid, so far as you can, of the larger tenants and to establish a dead level of small or middle-size holdings. Under this Bill, if it becomes law, the old pasture lands of Ireland, the admiration of those who visit that country, will to a great extent be broken up, and the cattle industry, on which the prosperity of the smaller Irish farmers so largely depends, will probably go to the wall. Not only that, but you will by this Bill, if it passes into law in its present form, unsettle the minds of the tenants who are hoping and expecting to buy, and you will unsettle the minds of those who have already bought their farms. In addition to that, you announce a policy which has perhaps been misunderstood, but which has been acclaimed by the Irish law breakers as a triumph of their defiance of law and order. Finally, you, who will not trust the London County Council to make a town-planning scheme of its own, are going to hand over one-third of Ireland, a great part of which is no more congested than Salisbury Plain, to a tribunal with a constitution and with functions, judicial and administrative, unheard of in the history of any civilised country. You cannot seriously expect the House to pass this Bill in anything like its present form. We on this side are ready to join with you in carefully scrutinising its provisions and in converting it, if we can, into a practicable and reasonable measure, but I do not think that anybody can pretend that as it now stands it merits any description of the kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01483"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FARNHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would not presume to address your Lordships' House so soon after having the honour of becoming one of its members but for the fact that I feel it my duty as a representative Peer for Ireland to do my utmost to oppose the principles in this Bill, which will be injurious to Ireland and to the landlords and tenants of that country. The great success of the 1903 Act was in a large measure due to the fact that it was the outcome of a conference between the landlords on the one hand and representatives of the
<col>434</col>
tenants on the other. An agreement was come to at that conference which enabled the Government of the day to pass an Act which had for its object the transference of land from the owner to the occupier without undue injustice to the landlord and without exacting from the tenants excessive payments for obtaining the fee simple of the land. This Bill completely breaks away from that conference. It introduces legislation which will be unfair to the landlord and tenant alike. Its principles are both confiscatory and Socialistic, and I believe them to be even more revolutionary than the Bill which is now being discussed in another place.<lb/>
If we take a brief study of Clauses 17, 41, 43, 64, and 69, they will show the revolutionary character of this Bill, which completely upsets the whole idea of land purchase as it has succeeded under the Act of 1903. These clauses empower the Estates Commissioners to acquire compulsorily any estates or untenanted land in Ireland, for they provide that when negotiations have been started for a sale and no agreement has been arrived at they will then be empowered to take that land compulsorily. Thus you might have an irresponsible body of, say, three or four tenants going to a landlord and offering him a price which it would be impossible for him to accept. The Estates Commissioners would then be empowered to make him a final offer. They themselves would name a price, and if he was unable to accept that offer without ruin to himself, they would then be able to take his estates compulsorily. A man holding a fee farm grant, and occupying and using the lands thereunder, will suddenly find his land regarded as untenanted and himself ousted to supply the demands of the cattle-driver and the landless man. By the term "landless man" I mean the man who not only has not got any land, but who never had any claim to have any land; he knows nothing of land, and if he was placed on it he would not know what to do with it. A vendor under this Bill is to have no say whatever in the price which he has to accept for his land. The price is to be fixed by the purchaser, to whose interest it is to keep the price as low as possible. This is nothing more than confiscation by compulsion, and the nationalisation of the land.<lb/>
I maintain that it is a gross injustice, and I cannot believe that the British nation, which has been able to boast of its sense of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0224"/>
<col>435</col>
justice and freedom, could ever allow such proposals as these to become law. Why has compulsion been thought to be necessary? is it that the voluntary system has failed? We know, my Lords, that the voluntary system has been only too successful. We have been informed that there are &#x00A3;53,000,000 of agreements now waiting to be financed, and I maintain that even more would have been lodged if it had not been for the policy of the United Irish League in interfering with negotiations. How can a Government which is unable to finance this voluntary system, with any show of reason get up and say that compulsion is necessary. I maintain there is no foundation for any compulsion whatever. If they maintain that compulsion is only meant for unreasonable landlords, why make the voluntary system an impossibility? For how do the Government propose to pay the landlord, who, if he is offered a reasonable price, would be willing to accept it? They propose to pay him with a three per cent. stock at face value, irrespective of its market value. In fact, they propose that the landlord has almost to float this stock. In other words, they propose to borrow from the landlord sufficient money to pay him off for his own estates.<lb/>
They are not content to rob the landlord alone; they proceed to rob the tenant, for they provide that where a tenant's holding is worth more than &#x00A3;3,000, and in some cases &#x00A3;5,000, they will not advance him any more money. This means that he will either be forced to remain on without hope of any other purchaser for his holding, or that he will have to surrender the remainder of his land, or part of it to the landlord, who, in his turn, will have it compulsorily taken from him as untenanted land and have it divided up between the cattle-driver and the landless man. Therefore this will be reducing the tenant's power of doing good in his county and his capacity for employing labour; and from the social standing to which he has risen by his own energy and ability he will be forced back to his former level, from which he advanced be it said to his own credit and to the credit of his country, which should be proud of him. But is that country proud of him? My Lords, if it is, this Bill is a very poor way of showing its gratitude. This Bill hits the small farmer just as hard as it hits the bigger one, for by hitting the larger tenant you deprive the smaller farmer of his market for his stock which, owing to a lack of capital and
<col>436</col>
the smallness of his farm, he is unable to rear himself. You may argue that you propose to take the land from the better class of tenant and give some of it to the small farmer, and enable him to rear his own stock; but what would be the result of that? He will, through his lack of experience of farming, be unable to compete with the better class of farmer, and he will go to the wall. If you give him this land you will also have to give him capital to stock that farm with. And these tenant farmers are shrewd men. They will realise that they will be unable to compete with the fanner who is already experienced in farming; they will sell their stock, and they will sublet their land again to the grazier. My Lords, I beg to move the adjournment of the House till a quarter past nine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01484">[<i>The sitting was suspended at eight o'clock and resumed at a quarter past nine.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01485"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FARNHAM</member>, resuming his speech, said: My Lords, when the House adjourned I was trying to point out that because you gave a small tenant more land and gave him capital to start it, you did not necessarily make him a successful farmer. He would, in all probability, be unable to compete against the farmers who thoroughly understood their own business; or else he would pocket the capital, sell his stock, and let his land to the grazier. This has in some cases already been done. One man was put on to a holding of 100 acres by the Estates Commissioners; the Commissioners bought twenty-three head of cattle for him at one fair, of which he sold fifteen at the following fair in another place, and his land is stocked with grazing cattle and he is selling the timber. Another man got seventy acres and a free grant; he is selling the timber and has sub-let the land. Another man got sixty acres and a grant of &#x00A3;100 to fit up a house. That man failed; he was unable to compete against the more successful farmers, and a Mrs. Ryan took over the land, sold the meadow by auction, and has sub-let the grazing. I only give these instances to show what will happen if you try and make successful farmers of men who have no knowledge of farming.<lb/>
It is all very well for Mr. Birrell to dramatically declare that the land is for the people and not for bullocks, but if Mr. Birrell believes what he says and is prepared
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0225"/>
<col>437</col>
to bring in legislation of this effect he will have to amend the law of nature, for the law of nature provides that we must eat to live, and that being so we prefer to eat bullocks rather than our fellow creatures. One of the best points of this Bill is the act that Ireland is to receive the sum of about &#x00A3;163,000 annually for the relief of congestion and distress. This is a fact which every one in Ireland will welcome, and Ireland will be deeply grateful to the Government for giving them this sum of money. But one of the worst points in the Bill is the nature and constitution of the Board which is to distribute this sum, and we sincerely trust, if we are to get this money as we hope we are, that the Government will take care to ensure that it will be distributed by a fair and impartial tribunal, which we have every reason to believe the proposed Board would not and could not possibly be. Now, my Lords, what is the necessity for the introduction of this Bill? What is the policy which underlies it? I have already pointed out that the failure of British credit to finance the voluntary system, as it was pledged to can with no shadow of reason be put forward as an argument for the production of confiscation by compulsion, and for those other revolutionary clauses with which this Bill bristles.<lb/>
In order to find out the real policy which is the cause of the production of this Bill it is necessary for a moment to take a look behind the scenes. This Bill is nominally introduced by a Minister of the Crown who, as such, should be impartial, and legislate for the good of the community at large. Recent episodes in another place have shown us plainly enough whose hands have caused this Bill to be drafted. When Mr. Birrell had the audacity to move an Amendment of his own without first consulting the Irish Party, he was met with such a howl of indignation that he meekly suffered the humility of voting against his own Amendment. This, my Lords, shows us plainly enough that the Bill is in reality that of the Irish Nationalist Party. What has been the persistent attitude of that Party towards land purchase? When the Land Conference met and came to an agreement about land purchase, that party pledged itself to support it, and it was Mr. Dillon himself who proposed the resolution which bound them to it. The outcome of that agreement was that the Act of 1903 was passed&#x2014;a triumph of conciliation; and, as a member of the present

Government who is now one of the sponsors for this Bill said, it opened up a new heaven and a new earth in Ireland. Ten days after the passing of that Act we are given the first inkling of the great breach of faith on the part of the Nationalist Party, and we find Mr. Dillon sowing the seeds of suspicion and of agitation in the minds of the Irish tenantry; for in a speech at that time he said:&#x2014;
<quote>"The passage of this Bill has only served to confirm in my mind the conviction, which I have always entertained throughout the whole of my political life, that in Ireland there is nothing to be hoped for except as the result of persistent agitation. To the amazement of some of us old campaigners we hear Irish landlords talking of conciliation, and while for my part I am entirely in favour of giving the new Land Act a fair trial and seeing what can be got out of it, I am so far sceptical that I have no faith in the doctrine of conciliation. I am willing to accept conciliation when the Irish landlords cease to be landlords, but so long as they are landlords I am sceptical of their conciliation."</quote>
From the date of that speech his policy became more and more clearly marked. Publications were prepared and issued to try and prove that the landlord was getting an exorbitant price and that the tenant was paying far too much. An agitation was started and the landless men instructed that they need only agitate and drive cattle and they would be able to make the Government give them as much land as they wanted. All this in some cases had the desired effect and stopped negotiations which might have come to a head, but in spite of it land purchase in the main continued to thrive.<lb/>
A new plan of action, therefore, has become necessary. Eventually, owing to the lack of funds and the curtailing of the bonus by the Treasury from twelve to three per cent., land purchase came to a deadlock and some financial amendment became necessary. Here, my Lords, was Mr. Dillon's chance, and he was not slow to take it, with the result that we have this revolutionary measure before us to-day. He has played his cards well, for whether this Bill becomes law in its present form or whether it is rejected he has secured the fact that agitation will continue in Ireland, for if it becomes law it means that there will be an internal strife set up between the landless men and the existing tenantry. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said that it was not possible to treat a congest as an emergency man and send him about
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0226"/>
<col>439</col>
accompanied by a couple of policemen; but if, as is proposed, a tenant is brought from the congested districts and planted down in another part of Ireland I maintain that the whole police force at the disposal of the Government will have to be planted down alongside him to keep him on that land. If this Bill is thrown out Mr. Dillon has threatened us with his dogs of war&#x2014;I suppose he means his well-trained and celebrated pack of cattle-drivers. We cannot believe that your Lordships' House will allow our country to be plunged into such a state of anarchy and completely destroy any hope of a permanent and lasting settlement of the land question, and we trust that this Bill will be so amended that it will become in reality a Bill for the furtherance of land purchase, and not, as it is now, an Act of revolution, Socialism, anarchy, and nationalisation of the land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01486"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who moved the rejection of the Bill and the noble Marquess who followed him have made several objections to this Bill. They say that it is ungenerous on the part of the Treasury because it puts up the rent charge which the Irish tenant is to pay from &#x00A3;3 5<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. per cent. to &#x00A3;3 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>.; they say it is ungenerous because it reduces the bonus which the British taxpayer is to give to the Irish landlord from twelve per cent. to something like seven and a-half, and they complain, too, that in all future agreements landlords may be obliged to take a three per cent. stock at par. Those, my Lords, are the three principal reasons why, if it comes to a Division, I for one intend to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill, because those are the three provisions in the Bill which do lessen the extreme burden of the Wyndham Act on the British taxpayer.<lb/>
I do not propose to go into questions that have been raised by other speakers as to how this Bill deals, with the Irish landlord and the Irish tenant, because there are plenty of Members of this House who are much more competent than I am to deal with any such subjects. But, if your Lordships will allow me, I should like for a few minutes to consider the whole position of British credit, on which, after all, this Bill is based, and on which the Wyndham Act was based. There is no doubt that at the present moment British
<col>440</col>
Government securities are, as compared with previous times, in a somewhat depressed position. It is very easy to give reasons for that. I noticed the other day in his speech at Birmingham that a noble Earl, who usually sits on the Cross Benches here, said, with very great confidence, that Consols were depressed because of the badness of the Government. That was a simple explanation, and any conclusion the noble Earl comes to will always be interesting to the country. But I venture to think it would have been still more interesting to the country if the noble Earl had gone on and given a reason for his belief. In what way can a Government affect the credit of the country by its goodness or its badness? Naturally a bad Government in any country can affect the country's credit. If a Government repudiates them the securities of that country will fall to nothing; if it talks of repudiating or cutting down interest the securities will fall; or if it goes so far as to add largely to its bonded indebtedness its securities will also fall. But the present Government has done none of those things. It has never in any way threatened the securities of the holders of British Government bonds. The present Government since it came into office has never issued one penny of Consols; it stopped the Public Works Act of the late Government under which much of what ought to have been the annual expense of the Army and Navy was put on to the Exchequer in the form of loans; and, furthermore, the present Government in the four years it has been in office has, I believe, paid off more debt than any Government ever paid off before in the same time. For those reasons, to say off-hand that it is the badness of the Government which causes the low price of British securities is, I think, somewhat rash.<lb/>
There are other reasons which I would submit to your Lordships' House as accounting very largely, possibly entirely for the low price of Government securities. One of them is the Wyndham Act, another is the Act which was passed also by the last Government by which Colonial Government securities were for the first time made trustee investments in this country. I do not want to go into this matter at length, but your Lordships know as well as I do what trustee securities were up to a few years ago&#x2014;British and India Government bonds, English railway prior charges, the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0227"/>
<col>441</col>
debts of Crown Colonies, and securities of principal English corporations. It was a question of supply and demand. What did the last Government do? They passed an Act by which the securities of the self-governing Colonies were made trustee investments in this country, and they thereby added enormously to the number of securities that were competing with Consols and other Government loans, and by that Act they automatically brought down the price of all English Government securities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01487"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: May I ask whether the noble Lord is talking about the Irish Land Bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01488"><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member><membercontribution>: I am, and if the noble Earl will bear with me a moment I think he will see that what I am saying is somewhat relevant. Under the Wyndham Act of 1903 the last Government created the addition of a large number of British Government securities. I do not know whether your Lordships are aware of what the total amount of securities so created, has been. It is the fall in Government securities which has made the finance of the Wyndham Act of 1903 impossible. In the year 1906 there were some &#x00A3;16,000,000 of trustee securities issued in the London market; in the year 1907, there were &#x00A3;14,000,000; in the year 1908, there were &#x00A3;41,000,000, and in the present year up to date there have already been &#x00A3;33,000,000 worth issued. The fact that there were &#x00A3;41,000,000 issued last year and &#x00A3;33,000,000 issued this year, is, I think, sufficient alone to account for the low price of Government securities. The total amount so issued in the last four years has been something over &#x00A3;106,000,000, and of those &#x00A3;106,000,000 &#x00A3;52,000,000 were either created trustee securities under the Colonial Securities Act or under the Irish Land Act. It is those two Acts of the last Tory Government which, as I say, put in this country an undue amount of trustee securities, which have caused this depreciation of British Government securities, and, by so doing, made the Wyndham Act unworkable. I think the noble Earl opposite will agree that that is relevant to the Bill under discussion.<lb/>
What is going to be the remedy? You will say, Has this depreciation ceased? Is it likely to cease? What is the position
<col>442</col>
to-day? There have been &#x00A3;41,000,000 of Irish landed securities issued already. Can the price rise when it is known by everybody in London that the further agreements which have been made amount already to &#x00A3;53,000,000? In other words, there are &#x00A3;41,000,000 of this Irish Land Stock on the market which have broken down the market, and if we had to go on with the Wyndham Act there are &#x00A3;53,000,000 more to come. In the face of that, I venture to say it is absolutely unlikely that these can be any great rise in the price of Government securities which would make the continued financing of the Wyndham Act possible. Noble Lords opposite may still think that the low price of these securities is due in some way to the wickedness of the present Government, and that if there is a change and the other side come in prices may rise. But what is going to happen if the other side come in? We had a great speech the other day by the ex-Prime Minister. He alluded with pride to the finance of the Irish Land Act, 1903, and held out great hopes that when his friends came back to office they would introduce legislation almost equally easy for the Scottish tenant and the English tenant to buy their holdings. If the finance of this scheme has broken down with &#x00A3;41,000,000 and you have &#x00A3;53,000,000 more already agreed on, and you have a Government estimate that on the top of that there is &#x00A3;73,000,000 more of Irish land to be sold, how in the world could any Government ever contemplate doing the same thing for Great Britain? It seems to me the reasons why the Wyndham Act has broken down are obvious, and it appears absolutely impossible that that Act can be continued as it is to-day.<lb/>
My own notion of the remedy for this state of things is a very simple one, and it is not the least likely to be adopted. You would, no doubt, put up the price of British securities if you took Colonial securities out of the trustee market, or if you repealed the Wyndham Act altogether, which I think would be the best thing to do. But, short of that, I do not see any alternative except the proposals of the Government, which at any rate mitigate the financial evils of the Act of 1903. If your Lordships will allow me I would just like to remind the House of what the proposals under that Act were. Under the Act of 1903 an Irish tenant can agree with an Irish landlord what the price of the land is
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0228"/>
<col>443</col>
to be, and when the price has been agreed the tenant can go to the British Exchequer and get the whole amount on loan. You know perfectly well if any one of you were advancing money on land anywhere you, as prudent men, would not advance more than two-thirds, or, at the outside, three-fourths of the value, but under the Act of 1903 you compel the unfortunate British taxpayer, who had no choice, to advance the whole of the money. The noble Earl shakes his head, but I think it is so. Then, again, the British taxpayer had something else to do. When the tenant and the landlord had agreed on their bargain, the British taxpayer had to find what is called a bonus, and give the landlord twelve per cent. as a present in addition to the price at which he had sold his land to the tenant. You would at least have thought when the Government of the day were making that handsome present on behalf of the British taxpayer they would have voted it out of the finances of the year. But nothing of the kind. They borrowed that too and left it to their successors of to-day, so that the unfortunate Government of the day has to charge the taxpayer with the interest on the bonus which the last Government gave to their Irish friends. I think the noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal understated it when he said that that finance was somewhat sanguine.<lb/>
What strikes me about this debate is that nobody so far has attempted to justify that finance. The noble Marquess opposite admitted that some alteration in the terms of the Act of 1903 was inevitable, but he said he would not go into the matter. I was very much surprised to hear that, because, if we are to judge by the newspapers, I thought the noble Marquess was going to add to all the other duties he performs so admirably the duty of exercising a sort of revising power over every Chancellor of the Exchequer from now onwards. At any rate, the noble Marquess said he was not going into finance, but he added that he thought it would have paid us well&#x2014;I suppose he means the British taxpayer or the British Government&#x2014;to have been generous. My-Lords, what does an Irishman consider generous? We find the whole of the money to purchase the land in Ireland. The last Government estimated it would amount to &#x00A3;100,000,000, but we now find it amounts to &#x00A3;180,000,000&#x2014;and we find that money without any margin of security. The bonus began at twelve per cent. and is
<col>444</col>
now reduced to seven and a-half, and the Government estimate that the bonus they have to pay and the losses on floating the loans which the Exchequer has to pay together are to cost the English taxpayer &#x00A3;25,000,000 as a present towards helping land purchase in Ireland. Yet the noble Marquess opposite thinks that we might have been generous. My Lords, I shudder to think what the Budget in any year will be when the noble Marquess is in power and has a generous fit on him.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite who moved the rejection of the Bill shook his head just now when I said that under the Wyndham Act the British Exchequer had no margin of security; they had to advance all the money. Technically, he is right. There were two securities provided for the British taxpayer. Firstly, there is the Irish Development Grant, a little over &#x00A3;100,000 a year, but &#x00A3;41,000,000 of Stock have been issued, and the Irish Development Grant is gone already. Secondly, there is one other security&#x2014;the Guarantee Fund, the fund that the English Government hands over to the Irish county councils to help them in their rates. That was provided as an additional security for the British taxpayer, but I do not think the noble Earl opposite was very anxious that that security should be continued. I will come to what he said in a minute, but he was full of what he called the meanness of the Government. He said the British Government were obliged to find the money to carry out the Wyndham Act, and that they had not done it. What is the position? That Act has been in operation for six years. Mr. Wyndham stated, according to his original plan, that for the first three years he thought the Government ought to find &#x00A3;5,000,000 a year, and after that he hoped the amount might be increased. The Government have exceeded their promises by something like &#x00A3;11,000,000, and yet the noble Earl used some very hard words about the Government. He said they were compounding with their creditors and setting a very bad example to the people of Ireland, that they were not honourable or honest, and that the course they had followed was not a creditable one&#x2014;severe words to be hurled at a Government which have not only carried out all their obligations, but have exceeded their promises by &#x00A3;11,000,000 in the course of six years. In the Wyndham Act there was a clause, agreed to by the Irish landlords and tenants, by their representatives in the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0229"/>
<col>445</col>
House of Commons, and by everybody all round, by which the Irish Guarantee Fund was to be responsible. What does the noble Earl say about that&#x2014;that the Government are neither honourable nor honest, and that their conduct is not creditable. What does he say about the Irish Guarantee Fund? He says the proposals with regard to it were absolutely impossible&#x2014;yet the last Government put them in the Bill&#x2014;and that the one solid security given to the British taxpayer in advancing all this money to the people of Ireland was a technical error; and the noble Earl moves the rejection of the Bill and says that that one clause must be wiped aside at once as it was always impossible, and it was only through a technical error that it had got into the Bill at all. Are we to do business on that basis? Is it not clear that the Wyndham Act was a mistake and that its finance is impossible, and that the whole thing has broken down because no market in the world will bear those huge amounts of land stock thrown upon it? Therefore, my Lords, if the plan of the Land Act of 1903 has broken down, as it is obvious to everybody that it has, then I say there is no other alternative before us but to support the financial proposals of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01489"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I consider that this Bill is an impossible one because every one must recognise that it is quite needlessly complicated and unnecessarily provocative. The speech which has just been delivered by the noble Lord who has such a knowledge of finance, shows that there is substantial matter to be discussed in reference to the finance of the Act of 1903, and that is not denied. I think whether we take the view which is suggested by him that it has broken down altogether, or the more moderate and reasonable view presented by my noble friend Lord Dunraven, that it may want some revision in some way, it is quite plain that it is desirable there should be some legislative re-adjustment of the financial position owing to the circumstances of the stock market and other matters. But if that be so, why not confine the Bill to that? It is suggested that a Bill was needed to revise the finance, and if the Bill had been confined to that and what was needed to make an equitable readjustment and to set the balance right, I venture to think the matter would have been discussed in that business spirit that the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, appealed to, and that an adjustment would have been
<col>446</col>
arrived at without any very great difficulty or complication. The Government, of course, is composed of able men&#x2014;that is, there are many very able men in it; but why was it necessary for 'them to go outside that large and important topic which called for adjustment and was so susceptible of adjustment to open up a re-examination of the whole policy on which the Purchase Acts were founded, and to tear up the Wyndham Act of 1903?<lb/>
I do not propose to follow the noble Lord in the discussion of finance. I have no special knowledge to enable me to do so; nor do I think it necessary in order to arrive at a reasonable conclusion with regard to this Bill at the stage at which we now are. But I may say, in passing, with regard to the raising of the tenants' annuity from three and a-quarter to three and a-half per cent., that although that might not mean a great deal to a man in big circumstances it would mean a great deal to peasants in Ireland. It may be that in the immediate present the contrast between the three and a-quarter and the three and a-half per cent. will not cause any serious dislocation of mind, but unquestionably, as time develops, there must be jealousy, if one set of tenants are found to be paying a smaller purchase annuity than another, and no explanation is to be given except the tall one that Imperial finance required it. Then I think it is also to be regretted, in considering the finance, that the bonus was not let alone; it was one of the great pillars on which the Act of 1903 rested; it was an encouragement and aid, and rendered it possible for the landowners to accept the purchase position presented to them. That has been changed. A new scheme in reference to the bonus has been drawn up. I myself do not think that as a business transaction it will assist the working of the purchase code, but there it is.<lb/>
Then the attempt to deal with the zones I cannot see has any business justification at all. The zone system was a business suggestion to save time, to save expense, and to save a duplication of inquiry and examination. That was its object, and it worked admirably; it saved great expense and delay. Now they say&#x2014;it is a stereotyped form in reference to this Bill with Mr. Birrell, and, to a moderate extent, with the noble Earl opposite&#x2014;that everything is intended to be used in an exceptional way, and only to a very small extent.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0230"/>
<col>447</col>
If those who were to administer the Act were to be gifted with angelic minds and superhuman sagacity we might be comforted with those assurances, but when I find a power to the Estates Commissioners to ride straight through the zones whenever they think right, I regard the clause as full of extreme danger. Passing away from the finance, where is the need of any provocative spirit going beyond the adjustment of the present necessities of the situation? Why attempt to go through all the whole machinery on which the land purchase code rested in order to effect this financial object? Every single one of the Purchase Acts&#x2014;I cannot say one more than another, but including the great Act to which the genius of Mr. Gladstone lent its force&#x2014;has been rested and rooted on the principle of voluntary action. You will not find a hint at any other influence, not a single one; but with a light heart the Government tear up all these principles and substitute a principle of compulsion; and it must never be forgotten, as has been said by my noble friend Lord Dunraven, that voluntary purchase cannot well coexist with the compulsory system. The argument is not equal or fair, the freedom is gone; once you enter into negotiation with the spectre of compulsion at the door the contest is no longer equal because the person with whom you are carrying on the negotiation can invoke that weapon in the background, and prevent the equality which had previously existed.<lb/>
I listened with respect and attention to the exposition of the Bill by the noble Earl opposite, and considering the magnitude of the task before him he condensed it, if he will allow me to say so, in wonderfully short time. The noble Earl, Lord Crewe, said there might be circumstances when justification might be found for some form of compulsion within reasonable limits and reasonably exercised, but when I take up this Bill and look at its clauses I remember that after all the Judges&#x2014;those poor abused people&#x2014;will not have to interpret the gracious words and the gracious manner of the noble Earl opposite; they will have nothing before them but the wide clauses of this Bill, which without stint or qualification give compulsion to two bodies over the whole of Ireland. What is the justification for it? I listened to the noble Earl attentively on that subject and not one syllable of a case did he suggest for the introduction of this great power.
<col>448</col>
I could understand a Government coming forward and saying, "This is a remedy which we do not like, but the circumstances are stronger than our wishes; we are assailed with this return and with that piece of evidence; we can no longer resist the evidence, and we are compelled, therefore, in spite of ourselves, to adopt this great remedy." But this matter has been discussed elsewhere only for some days, a stinted and starved discussion, and to-night we have had a debate extending over some hours. Can any of your Lordships, no matter what your memories may be, recall since the discussion opened any kind of case being made out for the magnitude of the compulsion that is sought to be enacted here? Where is the breakdown in the voluntary system? Since 1903, when Mr. Wyndham's Act passed, there have been transactions totting up to &#x00A3;84,000,000 of voluntary transactions, some of them completed and paid and others completed without being paid, and the purchase instalments we are all proud as Irishmen to know are paid accurately and well. That indicates the present prosperity of Ireland in a money way.<lb/>
Where does the pressure come in? This House passed the Evicted Tenants Act, which Mr. Birrell said was working well and could not be added to. The labourers of Ireland are adequately provided for by Statute after Statute and money grants, and three or four days ago Mr. Birrell stated in the House of Commons that he could not do more for the Irish labourers and that there was nothing more he could ask to be done for them. What case, then, is there for ignoring these facts? What case is there suggested or shown to exist for starting the tremendous policy of compulsion which is found in this Bill? My Lords, I venture to think that if one half of the energy which has been shown in this matter were applied to smoothing and simplifying the voluntary system there would be no question at all. Where is the proof of its necessity? It is notorious that in addition to the purchases that have taken place there are very many owners in nearly every county of Ireland who are most anxious to sell on any reasonable terms in the most voluntary way to any one who is willing to buy. The Congested Districts Board, I am informed by those who know very well, have on their hands hundreds, if not thousands, of acres of grazing lands awaiting disposition by
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0231"/>
<col>449</col>
them. I am glad to see that we have here one of the distinguished members of the Dudley Commission, who I hope will take part in the debate before it is over.<lb/>
The Dudley Commission had, of course, to deal with this question, and when the statement was made before them, as I suppose it was made more than once, that sufficient land could not be got from landlords willing to sell to enable them to meet the case for congestion, a very active and keen gentleman who was there at once applied himself to getting a return, which he presented in a couple of days to the Dudley Commission, showing that a great number of owners&#x2014;I think twenty-one&#x2014;were in a position to offer on the spot 12,000 acres for purchase by the Congested Districts Board and to be applied by them to the purposes needed. That will be found in Vol. 10 of the Evidence taken by the Dudley Commission, at page 1407, and I have no doubt that a great deal more evidence of the same kind can readily be found there. If any one thinks that I can be answered by citing from any other page of that Evidence I may say frankly that I have not read it all, and I cannot advise any one to do it; but, independent of quotations, is there any recent case that can be given within the last twelve months&#x2014;the Government have lots of time before the debate closes to-morrow&#x2014;where land has been refused to be sold to the Congested Districts Board or to the Estates Commissioners which has been needed for the purpose of checking congestion?<lb/>
I have said that the compulsion in this Bill is wide and unprecedented in its far-reaching character. Of course, compulsion is known to our law. Railway Acts are founded on compulsion, and it is given for many public purposes. In the Evicted Tenants Bill which we passed compulsion was granted, but there is nothing in the Evicted Tenants Bill which in the smallest degree supports the contention for compulsion in the present Bill. There the Bill stated the purpose for which it was to be used, its limited character, that it was confined to only two thousand tenants, and that before any one was restored it should be ascertained by the Estates Commissioners that the tenant to be restored was a fit and capable tenant suitable for the position. Is there a syllable in this Bill guiding or governing the discretion of either of the
<col>450</col>
parties entrusted with this work? Is there anything like it in any Statute of any civilised country? There is the Small Holdings Act which the noble Earl opposite is so proud of and administers with such care and attention. I have read that Act to see if there is any suggestion in it to support compulsion in the Bill before your Lordships. The cardinal proposition is found there that, if land cannot be acquired by agreement, that justifies the application of compulsion, and there is the great safeguard that that proceeding is administered by a great Government Department presided over by a capable head of standing and popularity. This, of course, requires us to examine the novel powers of compulsion that are given in this Bill. The Congested Districts Board are given a new congested district&#x2014;why I do not know&#x2014;and the Estates Commissioners are given the whole of the rest of Ireland. The Bill does not state that the parties who are to exercise the compulsion must be satisfied that there is a case for it; it is not said, from beginning to end of the Bill, that either the Congested Districts Board or the Estates Commissioners are to ascertain and be satisfied that lands required for the purpose cannot be acquired voluntarily and that there is nothing before them but compulsion. There is not a syllable said upon the subject. In the Evicted Tenants Bill there is a rigid limit put in of 2,000 people, but here there are absolutely no limits.<lb/>
My noble friend who spoke last on this side of the House gave extraordinary cases of men who were given farms up to 100 acres and of what they did with the trees upon them and with the stock that was given to them to work on. But there is no limitation here as to the quantity of land they are to get and no limit of any sort or kind, good or bad, placed on the exercise of their discretion by these people. I do not think the noble Earl opposite was comfortable in dealing with this part of the case. For whom is this compulsion to be exercised? Every one must admit that it is an immense power to give to any person&#x2014;whether one or ten I do not care in the least&#x2014;or to give to any Department the right to go in and turn an owner out without "by your leave" or "with your leave," and at a price fixed by themselves. For whom is this power to be exercised? I listened to the noble Earl with great attention, and I do not think he is in a position to answer that question in plain terms. Is it for the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0232"/>
<col>451</col>
landless men? That is a plain question. The noble Earl said that the landless men were not intended to be covered by any section at all.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01491"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is fortunate in not having a copy of the Bill in front of him. If he is in any doubt about it I can hand him a dozen. He concedes in other parts of the statement that the Bill includes landless men as well. There is no question about that. It is part of his argument that they had to be dealt with and were dealt with. I do not care whether they were dealt with in this subsection or that subsection. I think the noble Earl is wrong. But it was the intention of the Government, and that is what we have to deal with. I ask him, Is this compulsion to be exercised? Will the noble Earl answer me in plain terms? Is it to be exercised for the landless men alone, or for the congests alone, or for the two mixed up together? What is the effect of that? I have great respect for the noble Earl and admired the excellent exposition which he made with such conciseness, but I read over Clause 17 and came to the conclusion&#x2014;it might be wrongly&#x2014;from the way the noble Earl unfolded himself to the House at the point that he was not comfortable in that part of his exposition.<lb/>
Now, what is the meaning of a compromise? It is that each person has rights, and that each person must have a little give and take&#x2014;in fact, a great deal of give and take. Has the noble Earl read the Dudley Commission's Report&#x2014;not the whole, but a reasonable part of it? There, I think, he will find, in clause after clause and paragraph after paragraph, that if there is one thing abundantly plain it is that the Commission state with great force and great clearness that in their opinion the relief of congestion was to be found by relieving the congestion, and that if you sought to mix up that with the relief of the landless
<col>452</col>
men you would for ever perpetuate congestion. Is not that an immense fact? It is not one casual paragraph, but it is paragraph after paragraph. They dealt with every aspect of the question. We know the landless men. We know who they are and what they are. We know their hopes, expectations and wishes, but we tell you, as our deliberate opinion, that the only way to deal with congestion is to confine your efforts to the congests, and the only way to confine them to the congests adequately is by putting aside sternly the case of the landless men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01492"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble and learned Lord tell me why landless men are provided for in Section 2 of the Act of 1903?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01493"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I will with pleasure, but I strongly suspect that the noble Earl has a very fair suspicion. The Act of 1903 was an entirely voluntary Act, and what had to be dealt with in Section 2 was the provision for surplus lands after those primarily intended to be dealt with had had their claims satisfied. That is what is in Section 2. Surely it is as different as day from darkness to start bran-new legislation for landless men, providing not surplus land, but finding land out of which to drive owners by compulsion in order to find for these men new homes and new pastures&#x2014;something to quicken them and give them a pursuit in place of cattle-driving.<lb/>
The noble Earl was historically cautious, and if I were a suspicious man, which I am not, I should think that he went out of his way to say that he did not know who the landless men were. I do not know how he would stand cross-examination on that subject, but I think he would break down. The noble Earl said he did not know how they started. One would think that these landless men were mushrooms which sprung up in the night and fed on the dew. Why, they were never heard of in the time of the noble Earl. They never were heard of in the time of the eminent Statesman who was sitting near the noble Earl while he was speaking, Lord Morley. They are the creation of the present Chief Secretary. There was no cattle-driving until his time. He is the author and the creator of that new Irish pastime, and it was only about April, 1908&#x2014;I forget the exact month&#x2014;that cattle-drives
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0233"/>
<col>453</col>
commenced. Well, I am not going to say a word against them. Everybody must live, but certainly they are very lucky men. They break the law and a law is sought to be made for them, and by compulsion the real owners are to be put out to enable them to walk in under the <i>&#x0153;gis</i> and protection of the British Constitution. Well, my Lords, I will say only this on the subject, that with the clear findings of the Dudley Commission that the only way to give relief to congestion was to confine your efforts to the congests, it is startling and monstrous to find that all these findings are set at nought. But I will say no more on this point because I see a noble Lord opposite who is a master of the subject, and who having sat on the Commission will be able to speak with an authority which no person who has read only a moderate part of the proceedings could dream of doing.<lb/>
Now as to the change in the Congested Districts Board, I will only say a word. I believe on the whole the Congested Districts Board, has done able and valuable work in Ireland. I believe it is popular, but I know there is a great feeling on the part of many who have studied this question that the solution in the Bill is not wise. I do not put it more than that. Ireland is a well-Boarded country, and it would have been wiser to have distributed the powers of the Congested Districts Board over two of the other Boards which are working exceedingly well. But I do not go into that question. If the Congested Districts Board is to be maintained I do not understand the widening of its area so as to include many non-congested districts, and I do not in the least understand any justification for seeking to add the nine elective representatives. I say nothing against the individuals or against their honour or character, but it is obvious that men popularly elected who have not to provide a shilling of the expenditure, which all comes from the taxpayer, are not men whose qualifications fit them to consider the anxious and delicate duties, connected as those men are with local prejudice. Now the way this compulsion is to be exercised I will not discuss. It is startling. I suppose none of your Lordships have ever heard anything like it. Either of the bodies that exercise it may inspect and value without the leave of the owner, and, may be, without notice to the owner. It. may
<col>454</col>
be set in motion by a proposal from anybody&#x2014;it may be a member of the League for all I know, or a member of any other association&#x2014;and being so set in motion they would then have to go on and make a final offer.<lb/>
Mr. Birrell has not the very good fortune to be an Irishman, and therefore he is responsible for the curiosity of this drafting. The final offer is the only offer in the whole Bill. The price to be given is not a fair value, but it is to be what they are willing to give. Well, that is a very comfortable way of buying what you want, and there is no appeal, good or bad, to any one except as to price, and then the price is to be fixed by the Judicial Commissioner, aided by two skilled assessors selected by Mr. Birrell. What a comfort and consolation to the man who is going to be turned out of his property! The Bill says that the assessors are to be selected by the Lord Lieutenant. What does that mean? Does it not mean the Chief Secretary? I have the greatest respect for Lords Lieutenant, but what would they know or be expected to know about skilled and trained assessors? Why, the Lord Lieutenant would send off a line asking, "What on earth"&#x2014;I do not know what form of address would be used, but may be "earth" would be left out and he would not feel at liberty to appeal to a higher place&#x2014;he would ask, "What am I to do in reference to these blessed assessors?" and then the Chief Secretary would consult whoever he is in the habit of consulting in London on these subjects, and the two independent assessors would be sent to help the Judicial Commissioner.<lb/>
The whole structure of this business shows an effort made to squeeze out voluntary purchase and to coerce the owner. If there were time&#x2014;and there is not&#x2014;I could give section after section showing instances. I have sketched out five or six, but in mercy to the House and myself, having regard to the clock, I will only give one. The Congested Districts Board are given this enlarged district to do what they like with. And there is a section which says that no one is to bid against them, that no poor man in the whole district, or the whole world, is to be at liberty to come in and buy over the heads of the Congested Districts Board without their sanction. Did your Lordships ever hear such supreme nonsense as that? I pass
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0234"/>
<col>455</col>
by its grotesque injustice in saying that nobody, if he might like a farm or a property and might be willing to give a fair amount of money for it, shall be at liberty to buy it or make a bid for it without the sanction of those who have the power of coercing whenever they think it right.<lb/>
I do not understand the scheme of this Bill. I could understand it if it confined itself to finance, which required some adjustment. The way the Bill has been run with the Finance Bill excites some suspicion, because a suspicious person, which I am not, might have thought somehow or other their fates were interwoven. But why was it not sent here before? Why are all its stages sandwiched with those of the Finance Bill? It looks as if high-contracting parties had no child-like confidence in each other or in their work, and I should be very curious to read the last words of Mr. Birrell and Mr. Dillon on this subject. I can well imagine the judicial way in which Mr. Healy would indicate that "I told you so." But I am not suspicious, and all I say is this: If ever a Bill wanted investigation in Committee it is this Bill. I will adopt the course indicated by the noble Marquess and vote for the Second Reading, not with any great trust or confidence, but with an earnest desire that it may be improved and made into a somewhat more reasonable and fair Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01494"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to speak at any length on this Bill. I think pretty well everything I was going to say has been said before, and I think everyone must feel sympathy with me in having to follow my noble and learned friend who said everything that is to be said a great deal better than I can. However, I have only to say that I fully associate myself with those who look upon this Bill as an absolute obstacle to voluntary purchase which has succeeded so admirably for so many years. I speak with great diffidence as to its financial provisions because I do not pretend to understand finance, but I think that what we have heard is sufficient to show that some of its provisions are absolutely mischievous as impeding voluntary purchase, that others are inadequate for the object they have ostensibly in view of relieving the existing deadlock, and that some&#x2014;a very few&#x2014;are useful. They are few, but they are so far
<col>456</col>
useful that I am not prepared to support my noble friend who moved the rejection of the Bill.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, to come to a point that has been much talked of to-night&#x2014;the introduction of compulsion and the reconstitution of the Congested Districts Board. I hope the most strenuous opposition will be given to that by your Lordships. I think everyone will admit that a man's property ought only to be taken compulsorily from him when urgent necessity exists. Now, in the Province of Connaught where I live, and which has been specially mentioned as a place where compulsion is required, we are unable to find out not only that there is any necessity, but that there is any occasion for it. The Congested Districts Board have now more land than they know what to do with. They are the largest graziers in the Province of Connaught. Every fair is filled with cattle from the farms they have purchased and now hold, being unable apparently to dispose of them. We know besides, as was stated by the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench, that they have been offered large tracts of land at various times, to which there was no objection raised as to price, but which at the time they were unable to purchase owing to want of funds. It is most extraordinary that in a state of things such as this we should be told that there is any occasion whatever for compulsion. Is it not much more reasonable to suppose from past experience that any land they might require for purposes of migration could be acquired by them, provided they are prepared to give a reasonable price for it? But it is just the fair price which seems to stand in the way, and it looks very much, as has been stated by my noble friend who spoke last, as if the landless men and the cattle-drivers are looking, not only to obtain the property of their neighbours whom they have oppressed and injured, but to obtain it at a cheap rate, and that the Government have been induced by popular clamour to introduce compulsion to satisfy these unjust demands. If so, it is a manifest premium on agitation and an invitation to people to resort to turbulence and violence in order to obtain the benefits they hope for by legislation.<lb/>
My Lords, I must say that some words that fell from the noble Earl who introduced the Bill&#x2014;although I am sure he did
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0235"/>
<col>457</col>
not attach that significance to them&#x2014;would seem to give some support to a view of this kind. The noble Earl said that in parts of Ireland which were undisturbed and where the tenants were paying their rents contentedly there was no occasion for land purchase. Well, the inference might easily he drawn from that that orderly and law abiding farmers were not entitled to receive the undoubted benefits conferred on them by the Act of 1903&#x2014;the acquisition of the fee simple of their property on easy terms, and that these benefits were to be reserved for the turbulent members of their class in more disturbed parts of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01495"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble Lord would not misunderstand me himself, although he was afraid others might. It is undoubtedly true that the whole transaction of land purchase in Ireland arose out of the agrarian difficulties in that country. That, I think the noble Lord will admit, and it has been a disappointment to us that so much of the scope of purchase has taken place in those parts of the country where it seemed to us to be least required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01496"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: I should be more inclined to say that the necessity for land purchase arose not from agrarian disturbance in that country, but from the mischievous provisions of the Act of 1881&#x2014;the dual ownership conferred on landlord and tenant by that Act. That is, in my opinion, what rendered the Purchase Act expedient. But I am fully sensible that the noble Earl did not intend that any such inference should be drawn from what he said. The new composition of the Board would seem to bear this out. It is to be increased by nine members elected by the county councils; in other words, nominees of the United Irish League. Now the maxim and watchword of that body is the breaking-up of the grass lands and their division among the people of the locality. The original duties of the Congested Districts Board were confined in the congested districts to the relief of congestion&#x2014;at least, that was a great part of their duties&#x2014;by adding, when possible, to the small holdings and promoting migration to other districts. They were not appointed to divide grass lands among the cattle-drivers, and, what would practically amount to the increase of congestion, to dot
<col>458</col>
all over the country a multitude of small holdings. No doubt they were allowed by the Act of 1903 to dispose of superfluous land in their possession to certain people&#x2014;the sons of the tenants and. others limited by certain conditions. Those conditions have been so relaxed of late that it would appear as if they might give the lands almost to any one. We were glad to hear from the noble Earl that by subsection (<i>e</i>) of Section 17 it is not intended to give them to everybody, but as it stands it would seem that they might be given to anybody whom the Estates Commissioners may select. The Congested Districts Board as it is has, on the whole, done good work. Why not, therefore, leave it as it is to perform its duties, or a portion of its duties, for I think the provision transferring the promotion of industries to the Board of Agriculture is a very sound one. But leave the Congested Districts Board as it is to perform its old duties connected with congestion in its old area.<lb/>
Apart from the injustice of breaking-up these grass lands in this wholesale manner, there is another matter to be considered. There is the absolute dislocation of the cattle trade, for every one knows that young cattle require a large range and cannot be reared successfully on farms that have been divided into small parts. The same thing may be said of young horses. I read not long since that there was a shortage of horses for military purposes in the United Kingdom. Is it wise, therefore, to cut off the supply in this manner? My Lords, I have nothing more to say. I have only mentioned some of the objectionable parts of the Bill. Amendments will be submitted dealing with them which I hope will receive due consideration from your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01497"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall try in what I am going to say to be very circumspect in my language. I shall speak in sorrow rather than in anger. I regret on this occasion I have to dissociate myself entirely from the Party to which I owe allegiance, and to speak against the Bill now before the House; but as a Liberal and a believer in eventual Home Rule for Ireland I cannot join with them in trying to pass a measure which in its present form must absolutely prevent the possibility of Home Rule ever being given to my country, and is also so opposed to all Liberal maxims that I am
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0236"/>
<col>459</col>
astonished that any men brought up in the school of Gladstone, Bright, Forster, and Spencer can assent to its conditions. I can only imagine that the Cabinet has given a free hand to their Irish representative and that he has surrendered himself and his conscience to the leaders of mischief in Ireland. In those circumstances I am thoroughly justified in trying to do all I can to avert what I consider will be very grave dangers to our country, and in opposing those who wish to destroy its agricultural future.<lb/>
There are three points I wish to touch upon before I deal with the Bill itself. First, in examining this Bill in this House we are bound to consider what occurred during its passage in another place where a measure which deals with the lives and fortunes of thousands of Irish agriculturists was forced during three or four days through the House of Commons, exactly in the same way in which men were convicted and sentenced to death and goods confiscated under the terrible tribunals which sat in Paris in the great Revolution, and curiously enough the same instrument with a foreign name does the work in both cases&#x2014;the guillotine. Your Lordships may think I am making too strong an analogy or that I am laughing at this matter, but I am doing neither the one nor the other. There is a serious likeness. The unfortunate Frenchman undoubtedly lost his head as well as his property. In Ireland the Chief Secretary only deprives the Irishman of his livelihood, his means of existence, and his fortune, and with a callousness and carelessness which strikes me as significant. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"The game is up; you have got to accept my measure whether it is good or bad."</quote>
I will deal with this point more fully when we come to the compulsory clauses.<lb/>
The second point is as to how the Bill postpones any possibility of Home Rule for sixty or severity years. Are the Irish Nationalists such fools as to imagine, once the Treasury of England has lent these huge sums to Ireland, has installed three or four Treasury officials&#x2014;the so-called Land Commissioners&#x2014;as absolute rulers and dictators over every acre of land in Ireland, that England is going to run the slightest risk of giving Ireland control again over a penny piece of her money? By this Bill, if it passes in its present
<col>460</col>
shape, the Irish agricultural helots will be for generations under the heel of the British Treasury. That will be the effect of the Bill practically as it stands.<lb/>
The third point is worthy of the attention of even the Cabinet that is proposing the measure, and it should be carefully thought out by the taxpayers of this country. I have a right to speak upon it, as I believe I was the first person with the late John Bright to advocate land purchase or land sale in Ireland. I have brought forward several measures in this House with that object. I was consulted personally by Lord Spencer, Mr. Childers, and Mr. Bright in the measures that they had in hand, and for nearly twenty years I have worked assiduously at the three projects. The one point always kept in the forefront by the great Liberals I have quoted was that the sale should be voluntary and progressive. I remember Mr. Childers saving when he at length consented to a scheme of land purchase&#x2014;
<quote>"We must go slowly. If you sell all at once, even if it were possible, repudiation at some period is sure to follow."</quote>
It stands to reason if the different purchasers have different interests payable at different dates repudiation is most unlikely, if not impossible. On the other hand, the present Bill attempts by compulsion to make the sale immediate and wholesale, and will give the means of repudiation, and I have reason to think that even now such a plan is being fostered by some sections of the agitators. It is only by steady voluntary purchase you can guard against this. The Bill puts a premium on such a danger&#x2014;that of repudiation&#x2014;a danger which, if it occurred, must lead to a civil war between England and Ireland for the recovery of the huge debt which would be due by Ireland to the British Treasury.<lb/>
My last point is this; it is perhaps a sentimental one, but I have a right to urge it. We in Ireland hold our land under legal tenure such as obtains in England and Scotland. We have done nothing to invalidate that tenure. We have done all we could in our several ways to enhance the value of the land in our districts. My family and the families of many noble Lords opposite held lands in Ireland before England existed as a nation. We held them under tribal custom
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0237"/>
<col>461</col>
We held them afterwards under the most solemn covenants as feudal lords to your Kings. We have fought for them and retained them in evil days and in good days. We have spent large sums in improvements, and in doing our duty in our several localities. All this my family and others have done, and now we are to be compulsorily driven forth from our lands and homes because, forsooth, an English Chief Secretary is so alarmed at the United Irish League, that, he is obliged to say" the game is up." Cromwell instituted his Court (which, curiously, had three Commissioners on it) for confiscation and for driving the mere Irish to hell or to Connaught. We have now a Cromwell establishing the same type of Commission with the object of driving every Irishman, except his friends of the League, out of the country.<lb/>
We claim as Irishmen with these rights, with these credentials as resident and improving landowners, the same rights that you have preserved for the Englishman and the Scotsman. I say that if this Bill passes in its present shape it will place every Irish agriculturist for ever under the control and at the mercy of the British Treasury, will drive every atom of capital out of agricultural land, will put back the clock of progress for many years, and must lead every small farmer to envy his neighbour with a larger farm and covet his land, and thus create agrarian crime, not between landowner and tenant, for the landowner disappears, but between man and man, Irishman and Irishman, and farmer and farmer. I d o not say that the Bill is absolutely hopeless. There are clauses in it of great value; clauses which may be amended. Some of the difficulties which have cropped up since the Act of 1903 are properly dealt with. For instance, the finance clause which absolves the ratepayers of Ireland from guaranteeing the losses on the Development Grant is a great boon, and many of the technical clauses which grease the wheels of administration are of value. I cannot, therefore, agree to the motion for rejection, but I trust the House will try to evolve by careful and patient work some useful measure out of what at the present time is a most dangerous Bill.<lb/>
With regard to the financial proposals, I do not wish to say very much, but there are one or two points with which I should like to deal. The Treasury could, if they
<col>462</col>
had adopted any of the best Continental methods&#x2014;for agricultural land on the Continent has passed, without friction or loss to anyone, from owner to occupier&#x2014;have sold the land of Ireland twice over since 1866, and neither the Treasury, the landowners, nor the purchasers would have suffered or been one penny the worse. But that is past history. About half of Ireland has been sold, and you have to provide the means for selling the rest. As regards the tenant purchasers who are to be brought in under this Bill, the new departure is extraordinary. The Treasury exact a higher rate from the new purchaser under this Bill than they do under the 1903 Act, and therefore two types of annuity payers are created. What the result of this extraordinary man&#x0153;uvre will be it is hard to forecast. At first it will check all sales, and I think it will eventually give a handle for repudiation to the future annuitant occupier. They will say, "Why are we not put on the same footing as regards our annuities as those who have bought land under previous Land Purchase Acts?" Naturally, however, it is for the Treasury to decide this question, and as Lord St. David's has said, the expenditure has already been enormous and will be still greater.<lb/>
As to the finance of the Bill from a landowner's point of view, I have personally no great fault to find, and I am afraid I shall be at issue with some of my friends on the other side. I have always held that payment for land sold should be made in bonds, stock or cash&#x2014;half and half, if possible, but preferably in bonds, as was the case in Continental countries, provided always the bonds or stock were equivalent in value to cash. It is worthy of note that abroad, where the finance scheme was carried out on proper and wise lines, the land stock of several Continental countries stands much higher than our much-vaunted Consols. I see that in another place the Chief Secretary was urged to make better provision under his bond-issue clause for payment to vendors, but no answer was vouchsafed. I would strongly urge, if the Government and the Treasury wish land sales to go on, that some concession should be made in this direction.<lb/>
The change in the bonus system strikes me as unwise, and it will undoubtedly hamper future sales, as there are many who
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0238"/>
<col>463</col>
cannot sell without it, or must ask a higher rate or dispense with sale altogether. I conclude, therefore, that the finance provisions are the last effort the Treasury have been able to bring forward, and that they do not object to frustrate future sales as much as possible. If you are determined to work on these lines, let me urge what I have so often suggested. When you are offering bonds to the public, make them of the smallest denomination. A &#x00A3;10 or &#x00A3;20 Bond at 3 per cent. would be attractive to many of those in Ireland who now invest either on deposit accounts in banks, or in Post Office and other saving's banks. I venture to commend this idea most strongly. I know it would work well as far as finance is concerned, and it would interest the public in the success of the Land Purchase Acts.<lb/>
Now I come to what I think is one of the most dangerous proposals in the Bill&#x2014;namely, the abolition of the zones. I cannot think how any one who really wished to carry through land purchase could have suggested the reversal of the system of sales under zones. As one who has sold under all the Acts since 1886, I can safely say that the zone system was the key which unlocked the door of real land sale and purchase in 1903. It enabled the tenant and landowner to meet on equal and open terms. It gave each a starting point. Surely it would be possible without destroying this vantage ground to make it legal for the Estates Commissioners, if they suspect fraud or chicanery in a sale, to postpone negotiations until their inspector has inquired into the matter. From what I have read of the debates in another place I gather that there has only been one salient case of fraud among many thousand transactions.<lb/>
If the Estates Commissioners and the Government and Treasury wish to stop land sales for good, let them say so and do it; but the attempt to make the zone system responsible for fraudulent transaction is disingenuous, if not ridiculous and mischievous. If the Chief Secretary and his advisers want to carry on the sales of land they must leave the zone system alone. That system is based on judicial rents fixed by a Government tribunal. If the Government and that tribunal are honest, both sides, landowner and
<col>464</col>
tenant, must abide by those decisions. If the Government, on the other hand, is going to discredit its own work and the work of its employ&#x00E9;s we arrive at a deadlock. Perhaps that is what is desired by those who are the sponsors of the Bill.<lb/>
I now come to the compulsory clauses As regards those which deal with the congested districts, I will speak on them when we come in Committee to Part III. With regard to the proposal outside the congested area that if a landowner does not sell his estate he is to be made to do so by the Estates Commissioners making him an offer "at such price as the tenant is willing to give," I can only infer that the author of this Bill had in mind the confiscation clauses and Bills of Elizabeth, James I., Cromwell, Charles II., etc., and that it was proposed to make new plantations in Ireland on English lines. The result will be as disastrous as in those former days. I will now touch upon the mischievous scheme contained in the compulsory clause to deprive the landowner, not only of his land, but of all interests in any portion of it. All amenities are to be confiscated; his possibility of existence in his demesne or home farm is to be destroyed. He is to be denuded under compulsion of everything except his actual house, which is already ear-marked for a convent or monastic institution. I and others in Ireland know exactly what is meant by this scheme, and it is far wiser to speak out and let those on this side of the Channel who take any interest in Ireland know what is intended. For this reason I will speak more at length upon the compulsory clauses.<lb/>
The necessity of compulsory purchase was, I believe, hardly debated at all in the other place, as the closure precluded any one exposing its viciousness and absurdity, its oppression and object. In this House, I propose, as briefly as I may, to explain what it would mean to all agricultural classes in Ireland if this proposal were to become law. But before doing so let me point out the absurdity&#x2014;I hope all people realise how ludicrous it is&#x2014;that the Government should ask for compulsory powers, when they are unable to pay for the land sold voluntarily at this moment. As a matter of fact, fifty-two million pounds worth of land is now sold and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0239"/>
<col>465</col>
unpaid for, and the Chief Secretary wants powers to enable the Commissioners&#x2014;his Cromwellian Star Chamber&#x2014;to compel any one to sell any piece of land anywhere. I mean no disrespect to the present Estates Commissioners. I know them well and like them personally. I believe in their high sense of honour and impartiality, though I know well also how they are bullied and badgered by certain politicians, and I realise fully how frail Irish and even all human nature is when surrounded by importunate officials who are in their turn worried and fussed by questions in Parliament and pressure in high places, religious and political. I refer only to the Office; not to the individuals who compose it. The Commissioners, as I say, are to be allowed to compel any one to sell any piece of land anywhere, except in the case of a landowner his demesne house, garden, and home farm. The result might be that a landowner who had sold five years ago voluntarily would be waiting to be paid five years hence, while some other owner, who was compulsorily evicted, would be paid off at the price "his tenants were willing to give," and would be able to go away with his money at once. The Government cannot pay for years for what is already sold, and yet it wants compulsory powers to buy more.<lb/>
I have referred to the landowner's position under this scheme. Let me take the tenant's side of the case. Say a property voluntarily sold has to wait ten years for settlement, and the tenants have to pay three-and-a-half per cent. during that time, while a property alongside is compulsorily bought and paid for. The tenants on the latter get an immediate reduction and can laugh at the honest men on the other side of the hedge who are patiently awaiting their turn. How does this issue conduce to peace and quiet? It leads inevitably to bitterness, envy, and eventually agrarian crime. Everyone knows why these compulsory clauses are inserted in this portion of the Bill. They are the germ for compulsory acquisition of the resident landowner's home farm, demesne, garden, and eventually house, and everyone in Ireland knows the ultimate object that the framers of the Bill have in view. It is openly referred to by men of all shades of opinion, who say it is merely a question of waiting for a new Bill to come in, and then this germ will develop.<lb/>

Let me now point out the result economically to agricultural Ireland of such compulsion. Half of Ireland is now sold, and the majority of English nonresident owners have gone. The portions unsold are mainly represented by men who desire to live on in Ireland, or who wish their descendants to do so. If you try to force those men to leave the country, and if you take their land compulsorily, they will go. You have then a very grave danger immediately in front of you, because you at once force a number of unemployed labourers on the market. One noble Lord told me to-day that he employs 170 men. I myself employ a considerable number, and I should think every landowner in Ireland does the same. The Irish farmer, on the other hand, who has bought under different Acts will give out as little labour as he can, and will part with no land to anyone except by compulsion. What therefore will be the result? You will be compelled to bring in another Bill very shortly to force him to divide the farm which he has purchased under Government sanction, among the labourers of his locality. That will not conduce to peace. On the contrary, it will lead straight to agrarian crime of the most bitter kind. The object of these clauses is to prevent agricultural peace returning to Ireland. They are meant to keep this friction alive for ever, to stereotype and strengthen Treasury control over every acre of land, and to compel agricultural Ireland to become a land of white slaves, every man in which will be made to realise he has really no land of his own. He is there only on sufferance and is under the rod of the mighty Boards now being created and can do nothing without their permission. I have heard a good deal of rubbish talked about the Boards of Dublin Castle. There has never been anything like these newly-proposed autocratic bodies since the days, as I have said before, of Cromwell's <i>junta</i>, for driving the Irish beyond the Shannon; and this, my Lords, is the proposal of a Liberal Government. As an Irish Liberal and a believer in Home Rule I can only say I am amazed at the new departure, which is not only mischievous and unnecessary, but stupid.<lb/>
There are two clauses which will require very grave and serious attention. One of these is Clause 67, which deals with future tenancies. This, to my mind, is one of the worst suggestions in the Bill. It means
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0240"/>
<col>467</col>
opening up and perpetuating the rent-fixing work of the Land Commissioners. This Court is one that has done more to break down and destroy good feeling between tenant and landowner than any other. Its judgments are distrusted and disliked by both sides. They have been based on only one idea&#x2014;to reduce rent and keep many Sub-Commissioners employed. Yet it is proposed to keep this hideous anachronism going and to make it perpetual. The one object of the sale of a farm to a tenant occupier was to obliterate this system. The one idea of all who urged land purchase was to end this, and to allow each side to start afresh; in point of fact, to restore the Liberal system of free contract in Irish agriculture and Irish land finance.<lb/>
I come now to Clause 67. Future tenants referred to in this clause all became "future tenants" with their eyes open. They can purchase as well as other tenants. Their position is the same as that of other tenants. Section 45 is inserted to give work to those who may have got a nice easy job under the Land Commission, and to give the agitator another point from which he can jump off and start a renewal of agitation. Then under Section 15 of the Bill the amount of the advance to any one tenant purchaser is restricted from &#x00A3;5,000 to &#x00A3;3,000, and the purchaser must be "resident." This is absurd. The Act of 1903 recognised the necessity of inducing the larger farmers to remain in Ireland. Out of their class must come, and are now coming, the J. P.'s, the county councillors and all those who must, in every rural community, guide, help and govern. The landowner is going rapidly, and his house is becoming a religious domicile. The only people who will carry on local government are the larger farmers. The State is acting in a suicidal manner in trying to deprive these men of their right to purchase. These men will also be the only employers of labour, and if the Government wish to keep the peace in rural Ireland after the great confiscation is carried through they must bear in mind that the labourer will eventually claim his share of the loot. If the larger farmer who employs labour is wiped out, the struggle for existence by the labourers will begin more rapidly and be more disastrous.<lb/>
It may amuse your Lordships to hear a story hearing on this point. A farmer, who had two farms in the County of
<col>468</col>
Limerick, was a man of very determined character and was very well known in the district. He was approached by the Land Commissioners with a view to acquiring one of his farms and an inspector came down to tell him that this farm was going to be taken by the Land Commissioners for certain evicted tenants, or, what may now be called "landless men." The farmer looked at the inspector and said, "Now tell me, when will these men come down to take my farm." The inspector replied, "I cannot tell you the exact date, but it will be very shortly, as the arrangements are being made." Then the farmer said: "Well, you can tell the Land Commissioners from me that if those men come down to my farm on Monday they will be stiff by Tuesday." I daresay noble Lords know what is the meaning of the word "stiff" when used in that sense. The curious fact is that the Land Commissioners sent none of these evicted tenants down to the farm, and the man is still in undisturbed possession of it.<lb/>
There are several minor clauses in the Bill with which I agree. They are of a technical nature and in many respects are merely rectifications of omissions or mistakes in the 1903 Act. I will refer to these if they come up in Committee. There is one other clause I wish to refer to for one moment&#x2014;namely, the fee farm rent clause. Clause 69 is, to my mind, most dangerous, not to the landowners, as it will hardly affect them, but to the very large class of fee simple holders who would come in under it. Under previous Acts it was settled that holders of fee farm rents could sell to their under-tenants, reserve their own lands, and pay off the guarantor of the fee farm rent. Now it is proposed to deprive these men, in most cases large farmers, of their holdings and occupation. I consider this clause would put a premium on agrarian crime, as everyone will be trying to get a bit of this type of land, and the unfortunate farmer would be at the mercy not only of the Estate Commissioners but also of his poorer neighbours. It lends itself to an absolute orgy of land grabbing at the expense of, most likely, the most useful and necessary class in the Irish agricultural community&#x2014;namely, the improving large farmer. I know of many farms of these two types&#x2014;the fee farm grant and the long leasehold I know that their owners and occupiers are the very last men the Government should wish to displace.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0241"/>
<col>469</col>
The Chief Secretary I see stated he was a very bad draftsman, and I can only imagine this is another of his attempts at creating chaos in Ireland. I shall oppose this clause in Committee most vigorously, not from the point of view of the landowner, but to protect a deserving and useful class of agriculturist against the Court of Confiscation which it is proposed to set up in Dublin.<lb/>
As to the whole gist of the Bill, it strikes me first as the determined attempt of the man who wished to kill land sales and purchase years ago. I need not refer to the gentleman by name. As that attempt has failed hitherto, and there is now about &#x00A3;60,000,000 worth of land ready to be sold, the Government and Treasury have decided to check land sales as much as possible, to break and ruin the larger farmers who have trusted to the terms in the older Purchase Acts, and to sow dissension and troubles between larger tenant purchasers and smaller tenant occupiers by depriving one portion of them of their lands, and by handing those lands over to other tenant purchasers. The Bill will, if carried into active effect, devitalise the big cattle trade which sends so much money through the country. I am a tillage farmer myself, and a small farms advocate, but I know that the large farmer and the cattle jobber are absolutely necessary also. The Bill will force every landowner, whether he has sold his property or not, out of Ireland, and will deprive the country of any little capital these men may still have. It banishes for ever from Ireland one of the great axioms and beliefs of Liberal policy&#x2014;freedom of contract and individual independence.<lb/>
These two keynotes of existence are destroyed throughout agricultural Ireland, and a Commission of three or four, who may or may not be Irishmen, but are in any case Treasury servants, are placed in supreme command with despotic powers over the whole agricultural life of Ireland. Such a scheme has been unheard of before, and yet agriculture is our main business. What would people say if the Government were to place two or three Treasury nominess in possession of the rights of the Lancashire cotton spinning industry or the Welsh coal industries? We should never hear the end of such an attempt, and yet we poor and mere
<col>470</col>
I Irish, as Cromwell called us, are to be brow-beaten into accepting this Board of Commissioners, this Agricultural Star Chamber, this Vehmgerichte of the United Irish League. Any Irishman who has the pluck of a mouse must protest against such a mischievous measure.<lb/>
It is not necessary to refer again to the monstrous farce that the Government propose in this Bill. Compulsion is to be used to force every landowner to sell his property, and this at the very moment when the British Treasury is unable to complete for want of money the sales of &#x00A3;60,000,000 worth of land already sold. I will not drag in the old story of the treaty or covenant entered into between the influential leaders who signed the <i>concordat</i> between tenants and owners as to the terms of sales. I do not believe personally in the faith of any Government official, but I had hoped the possibility of giving peace to the Sister Country would have induced any Government&#x2014;they are all alike&#x2014;to have stuck to their compact. The present Irish authorities have decided not to do so. They think repudiation of that agreement, further agitation and more waste of money in Irish police, more Irish officials, Irish misery and trouble, is the best way to govern Ireland. They talk in their public speeches about giving Home Rule. They know in their hearts that this Bill is a tighter, harder iron link to bind Ireland to England as the wretched borrower is bound for ever to the moneylender, and that it makes Home Rule hopeless for years to come.<lb/>
The objects contained in this Bill are to give years of work to the officials and boards who already "utilise" and run Ireland; years of emoluments and practice to the Irish lawyers; years of agitation to the United Leaguer, Nationalists, M.P.'s, publicans, and all the hangers on who benefit by these organisations. As for agricultural Ireland, the objects of this Bill are destruction of freedom of contract, the sowing of the seeds of a land war between small and big farmers, and between labourer and employer, and eventually the repudiation by the Irish tenant purchaser of a debt collected by what is called the old original enemy&#x2014;England. It is not a cheerful outlook, and cannot, I think, commend the Bill to your Lordships in its present form. Whether it can be amended sufficiently is hardly for me to say at this stage; but
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0242"/>
<col>471</col>
I am of opinion that it might be made less impracticable for and harmful to the whole condition of agricultural Ireland, if a judicious compromise could be arrived at on some of its most mischievous features.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01498"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONCURRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire briefly to ask your Lordships to bestow careful consideration on Part V of this Bill, which deals with future tenants and was slightly touched on by the noble Lord who has just sat down. The Bill was first introduced by the Chief Secretary for Ireland in November last. In that Bill the section appertaining to future tenancies, in Part V, was very similar to Part V of the Bill now before your Lordships' House. The Chief Secretary supported that Part very strongly and based his argument upon the fact that in the year 1887 Parliament had passed an Act containing a clause that is generally called the "eviction-made-easy clause." The Chief Secretary stated with perfect truth that a great many tenants had lost their status under the policy of that particular clause; that they had become caretakers; and that he desired under his Bill to restore them to the state of so-called present tenancies. The Bill introduced last year did not reach this House before the close of the session. It was reintroduced this year and again included Part V, but the clause, although containing practically the same matter as before, had its retrospective action somewhat dangerously increased. The Bill went through all its stages in the other House, and I have here a copy of it printed as amended in Committee.<lb/>
After the Bill had passed through Committee words were inserted in Part V extending the scope of the section in the most extraordinary way, and including some provisions that your Lordships would hardly credit. Take a case like this. Where the tenancy right or judicial tenancy has been sold by public auction, where the purchaser has paid his purchase money, including all the costs and expenses incidental to the purchase and assignment, the tenant right he has purchased is to be taken away from him. The clause does not say one word about compensation to the man who has purchased, but the tenancy is to be given back as a free gift to the man who sold it twenty-five or thirty years ago. The Bill also proposes the cancellation of every existing lease
<col>472</col>
within the meaning of the Land Act of 1881. I do not think the Chief Secretary could have intended when those extraordinary additions were made to Part V that this clause should be seriously discussed in your Lordships' House. If it were capable of amendment an effort might be made to render it workable, but I am afraid it is not.<lb/>
I feel myself almost under a personal obligation to say a few words on this Bill. Looking round the House I realise that I am one of the few survivors of those who have taken some small part in every attempt in this House to frame Irish legislation for a period of forty years, including the Land Acts of 1870 and 1881. In various parts of the Bill two words occur with ominous frequency&#x2014;namely, "untenanted land." I say without fear of contradiction that the main argument addressed to the English and Scottish Members of this House to induce them to sanction the exceptional legislation imposed on Ireland was the statement that Irish land tenure differs essentially from the land tenure of England, Scotland, and all other civilised countries. We have been told that this exceptional legislation was only necessary because of the curse of dual ownership. I ask your Lordships what is "untenanted land." The owner must fall into one or two categories&#x2014;either he is the representative of the old yeomen, occupying his own parcel of land, paying no rent to a landlord and receiving no rent from a tenant, or he must be an ordinary landowner who has in recent years acquired the tenant right of land from an out-going tenant. I earnestly trust that your Lordships will give us attention and assistance in Committee when we are trying to improve the two parts of the Bill in the directions I have indicated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01499"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I see that this measure is entitled&#x2014;
<quote>"An Act to amend the Law relating to the Occupation and Ownership of Land in Ireland, and for other purposes relating thereto."</quote>
I think it might much more properly be described as "an Act to abolish the voluntary system of purchase in Ireland, and to substitute compulsory appropriation." The Act of 1903 contained many useful provisions, and among others three essential features which were very conducive to its success. They were voluntary agreements
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0243"/>
<col>473</col>
between vendors and purchasers, the system of zones, and the bonus. How have these three essential features been dealt with in this Bill? They have simply been swept away. In the place of voluntary agreements there is to be compulsion; in the place of zones an expensive and arbitrary system of inquiries as to the value of the land; and in the place of fixed bonus, one varying in inverse ratio to the price. Has the voluntary system failed to work properly, or has it worked so well and so successfully that the Government and its subordinates are desirous of putting a stop to the enormous purchases which have taken place under it? Under the voluntary system between &#x00A3;80,000,000 and &#x00A3;90,000,000 worth of land has passed into the possession of the occupying tenants, and although it must be admitted that a considerable portion of the purchase money has not been obtained, can it be said that a system which has been so enormously successful ought to be abolished and a compulsory system set up in its stead without very serious consideration, and without cases being brought forward to show an absolute necessity for a change?<lb/>
I must say it has been very difficult for noble Lords on the Opposition side of the House to carry on the debate, considering that we have to follow each other. We throw the ball over to the other side, and it never comes back. The Government have been challenged to show any case whatever for compulsion, and neither in debates elsewhere nor in your Lordships' House have we heard one single word said why compulsion is necessary. It seems to me that the very success of the voluntary system has been made the excuse for killing voluntary sales. Those tenants who have purchased their farms are too contented, prosperous, and peaceful to satisfy the agitator, whose occupation and income would be gone if Ireland were only permitted to be peaceful, quiet, and prosperous. Let the trade, the commerce, the prosperity of Ireland perish, so that the paid professional agitator may survive and thrive! That is the creed of the real authors and promoters of this Bill. What does the Bill provide in the place of the voluntary system? It provides by Clause 43 nothing but compulsory expropriation. The vendor is not to be consulted or to have any voice in fixing the price at which his land is to be taken away. He is not to be considered in any way. All that is required is that
<col>474</col>
somebody&#x2014;any one&#x2014;may come forward and offer any ridiculous price to the vendor, and if the vendor refuses to accept the terms offered, the assistance of the Land Commission can be invoked, and the Land Commission can come down, fix the price, and obtain the land compulsorily. They need not consult the landlord in any way as to the price, but simply take into consideration the price which the tenants, or other persons, may be willing to give. What sort of price is it likely that the tenants or other persons will give when they know that this is to be the standard by which the price is to be fixed?<lb/>
Then it is proposed to abolish the zones&#x2014;one of the most useful provisions in the Act of 1903. Under that provision, if a landlord and tenant agree to sell the land at a considerable reduction on the tenant's rent&#x2014;usually from twenty-five to forty per cent.&#x2014;the purchase goes through as a matter of course. Under the present Bill there will be an expensive system of inquiries. If the Commissioners are satisfied that an inquiry is necessary, they can have one in every case. How are they to be satisfied as to the necessity for inquiry? No doubt what will happen will be that they will listen to the <i>ex parte</i> statement of the would-be purchaser and will immediately institute an expensive and costly inquiry at the expense of the vendor. Then they are at liberty to alter the price and fix it as they please, and if the vendor declines to accept their price they can take his land compulsorily. He will not even be in the position of being able to rescind the existing agreement and of being placed in the position he was in before. I am aware that in another place a case has been quoted, and pressed for all it is worth, to show that this system has been abused. I know nothing whatever about that case, but I think it speaks volumes for this provision that although it has been in force for upwards of six years only one case has been quoted in which there is any suggestion of fraud, or anything of that kind happening. It is, perhaps, the one exception which proves how very useful this provision has been in assisting in the enormous sales which have taken place. By the bye, I have heard that that case upon which so much stress has been laid was decided by the Court of Appeal in Ireland and that it was decided that there was no fraud of any kind in the case, and that it was a perfectly legitimate transaction. I do not know, if the highest
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0244"/>
<col>475</col>
Court of Ireland has so decided, why it should be continually quoted over here as such an atrocious case as to require the whole land laws of Ireland to be altered. This Bill suppresses the zones, and in the place of that system encourages all sorts of inquiries and inspections. Those are scarcely matters to encourage land purchase in Ireland.<lb/>
I should like to say a word with regard to the congested districts. I am not very well acquainted with them, because I am glad to say my county is not a congested county now, whatever it may be if this Bill should pass. But I must protest in the most emphatic manner against the county with which I am intimately associated&#x2014;Clare&#x2014;being included among the scheduled counties in this Bill. There is no congestion in Clare, or if there is I do not know where it is, and I have been all over the county. Possibly some people may consider there is some congestion amongst the fishermen along the coast. Their chief occupation in life is fishing, but no doubt they occupy their spare time on their small farms. But is that a reason why the whole county should be scheduled as a congested district and handed over to the tender mercies of such a Board as that composed under this Bill? I see the Board is to consist of three <i>ex officio</i> members&#x2014;I think the Chief Secretary, the Under-Secretary, and the Secretary for the Board of Agriculture are the three&#x2014;five appointed members, nine representative members, and two paid members. In regard to the three <i>ex officio</i> members I desire to be silent. With regard to the five appointed members, by whom will they be appointed? Nominally, no doubt, they will be appointed by the Chief Secretary, but in reality they will be appointed by the man who has ever been hostile to landlords in Ireland and who is the real author of this Bill. Then we come to the nine representative members. They are to be elected by the local authorities, which, in some counties at all events in the West, are composed of the most violent agrarian agitators in the country, manipulated by the United Irish League. To complete the ball, there are to be two permanent paid members. What qualifications are these gentlemen to have? Apparently none except perhaps to absorb &#x00A3;4,000 a year of public money.<lb/>
Then we come to the property owners. How are they represented on this Board? They are not represented at all. They are
<col>476</col>
entirely ignored. The fixing of the price as well as the taking of their properties is left to the tender mercies of this Board, which will consist almost, if not entirely, of the nominees of the United Irish League. This Board will have control over one third of the whole of Ireland. Are the men of whom this Board is composed likely to show justice or fair play to these landlords? And yet this Board is not only to take land compulsorily, but will have the distribution of it. Think what an amount of favouritism, jobbery, and corruption there will be in the taking and distributing of land by this Board. Does anybody suppose that this Bill will facilitate land purchase or in any way relieve congestion? Under this Bill the land will be given to the "landless men." I understood the noble Earl opposite to say that he did not know the term, that it did not exist in his time in Ireland. He traces it, perhaps, to the Bill of 1903. I can assure him it has a very different origin&#x2014;namely, that of the United Irish League. That is the creator of the landless men in Ireland. The land will be given to those men, and woe betide the luckless congest who should venture to leave his own district and migrate to the fertile lands behind. His life will not be worth a moment's purchase. This Bill will leave the great question of congestion unsolved and make it impossible of solution in the future. Does any one who knows Ireland suggest that this Bill originated in the fertile imagination of the Chief Secretary for Ireland or in the Department over which he presides? No, my Lords, it had its origin in the brain of a man who has ever been hostile to the voluntary system of land purchase in Ireland, whose powerful mind has obtained the complete mastery over that of the Chief Secretary, and whose Party, to use the words of a distinguished member of that Party, retains in Dublin an office within whose walls the Government of Ireland is carried on.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH LAND BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01559">Debate on the Amendment to the Motion that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>, viz., That the Bill be read 2<sup>a</sup> this day three months, <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01560"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those of us who speak from this side of the House in this debate are, I think, in a position of some inconvenience, if not of some difficulty. So far, we have only had one official speech from the Bench opposite&#x2014;namely, the speech of the noble Earl the Leader of the House, and that speech was necessarily in the main expository in character. I noticed that during the hour and a-quarter over which that speech extended, the noble Earl devoted as much as three-quarters of an hour to an explanation of the finance of this measure. But I understand that that is a part of the Bill upon which it is difficult, if not impossible, for us in this House to make any impression. In the remaining half hour of his speech the noble Earl skated over the surface of the remainder of the Bill, avoiding the dangerous currents and the deep pools with a dexterity with which we are now perfectly familiar in this House, but which, if I may say so, although it may have enabled him to escape immersion, left us admiring but quite unconvinced. Since then no official speaker from the other side of the House has made any attempt to reply to our questions or to answer our arguments. In these circumstances speakers like myself cannot, I think, be blamed if there is a certain inevitable reiteration in our arguments, and if we press again and again the points to which no reply has has yet been vouchsafed. Hitherto, with one exception, no speaker who has not been connected with Ireland, either by birth or residence or official position, has taken part in this debate, but I hope it will not therefore be regarded as an impertinence on the part of an Englishman like myself to venture to intrude upon this discussion.<lb/>
This Bill is as much an English interest as it is an Irish interest, and from a certain point of view it is even more so. In the last resort it is the credit of the British taxpayer that is involved in the vast transactions contemplated in this measure. As far as I can make out, the direct obligation imposed upon the British taxpayer by this Bill will amount to over twenty-five millions sterling instead of the bonus of twelve
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0248"/>
<col>483</col>
millions that figured in Mr. Wyndham's Act. In addition to that the taxpayer here has to bear the costs of the flotation of the future stock, and the Chief Secretary for Ireland has told us that he will be mulcted to the tune of fifty thousand pounds in every million of stock that is raised. That is, I understand, the direct contribution of the British taxpayer to the settlement of this question. But then beyond that, and much greater than that, is his ultimate responsibility for the whole sum that is to be raised.<lb/>
Now, your Lordships know perfectly well what the figures are. Twenty-eight millions sterling have already been found and provided for this purpose. Fifty-six millions are now due in respect of arrangements that have been concluded, but owing to the want of money, have not as yet been carried out, and we are told by the Government that ninety-nine millions further are required. Now the whole of this vast sum, amounting to over one hundred and eighty millions sterling, and likely to swell, in the opinion of the most competent authorities, to over two hundred millions, is raised upon the basis of British credit. Irish credit alone would, of course, be insufficient to bear the burden. I do not, of course, fail to see that the combined interest of the landlord and the tenant in Ireland are more than sufficient to cover the advances that would be made under this Bill. That is quite true, but the only ultimate security that the taxpayer in this country will possess will be the economic soundness of the experiment you are going to set up in Ireland, and the character, the industry, the thrift, and the capabilities of the peasant population whom you are about to encourage and to institute. I therefore venture to say that this is a matter of vital moment to your Lordships' House, and it is for you as the custodians in this matter of the interests of the British taxpayer most closely and carefully to scrutinise the proposals under this Bill.<lb/>
I am certain that, if the British taxpayer realises the immensity of the stake at issue, he will be the last to complain of your Lordships' House for any attention, however minute and however close, that you may give to the consideration of this Bill. I think these considerations are all the more important because in the Report of the Dudley Commission very little attention is paid to the interests of the British tax-
<col>484</col>
payer, and in the debates I have read in another place not much seems to have been said about him. Indeed the greater part of this measure was never discussed in the House of Commons at all. It therefore seems to me scarcely possible to imagine a case in which the necessity for the action of a Second Chamber is better established than in this. If this Bill were to pass into law in its present form, this country would really have been committed almost without its knowledge&#x2014;because I am told that nobody reads the debates in the House of Commons now, whatever may be the case with your Lordships' House&#x2014;to a revolution in the agrarian system of Ireland as great as any revolution that may be expected from the Finance Bill that we are shortly to discuss in this House, with results upon the future economy of Ireland as disastrous and as profound.<lb/>
There is a further reason I venture to suggest why you should look carefully into this matter, and why even an Englishman from the outside may venture to speak upon it. Depend upon it the principles that underlie this Bill, though they may be for the moment confined to Ireland, will not be long before they permeate into this country. Compulsory purchase in the interests of a poor and meritorious class of people; the erection of a powerful and irresponsible tribunal swayed by the currents of public opinion in the localities concerned, and provided by His Majesty's Government with large funds&#x2014;an almost inevitable instrument of bribery&#x2014;for forcibly acquiring land at arbitrary prices which bear no relation to the market value of the day&#x2014;these are doctrines which will find, nay, which I think have already found, eager and willing disciples in this country. I remember a saying&#x2014;I think it was one of Mr. Disraeli's&#x2014;that St. George's Channel had been through all the centuries the greatest barrier that had separated the hearts and sentiments of the Irish people from our own. That may be the case, but it will be no barrier to the transmission of these doctrines and these principles from Ireland to England. The principles of this Bill are distinctly and directly Socialistic, and at the very moment that we are asked in this House to contemplate a scheme of finance which is in many quarters credited with those features, we are asked to pass into law and to sanction in Ireland an agrarian revolution which is on precisely analogous lines. I hold, therefore, that on
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0249"/>
<col>485</col>
the principle <i>Proximus ardet Ucalegon</i> we, as the possible, nay, even the probable next victims of the experiment, are entitled to look most closely into the first instalment of it which is presented for our notice over the way.<lb/>
To any one who has watched even from the outside the progress of Irish land legislation during the past quarter of a century, it must, I think, be a somewhat disappointing and even melancholy reflection that this is the latest phase to which we are now brought. Almost my first political recollections were connected with the question of land tenure in Ireland. When I entered Parliament the Statutes which were associated with the name of my noble friend Lord Ashbourne, who did so much for the system of land purchase in that country, were in course of being enacted. I remember very well the Land Bills of Mr. Arthur Balfour in 1891, and of Mr. Gerald Balfour in 1896. I recall the long and sometimes acrimonious debates that took place in the House of Commons on those Bills. Those measures attained a certain and a moderate amount of success, but they did not attain a complete success, because they failed at the crucial point of offering an inducement to the landlord to sell. Then in 1903 my right hon. friend Mr. George Wyndham, at a hopeful, and, I think I may say, even a dramatic moment, appeared on the scene with his eirenicon. I notice that the occasion was one that has tempted almost every speaker who referred to it to drop into metaphor and almost into poetry. It is true that everyone felt that the clouds that had settled over this question so long were being lifted, and that the dawn of a new and a better era was in view. I remember a phrase used by Mr. John Redmond, the Leader of the Irish Party in the House of Commons, to the effect that this Bill was "bringing to an end the struggle of centuries." And again Mr. William O'Brien said that this was "a great treaty of peace" between the contending parties in Ireland. Well, the Bill passed into law, and I hope I may say this, that nothing that has since passed has in any way detracted from the statesmanship of the author of that Bill, or of the Party that supported him in carrying it into law, or has snatched one single laurel from the brow of my right hon. friend. On the contrary, whatever be the fate of that Act, if it be modified or wiped out, it will always stand out as a landmark in the history, not merely of the Statesman and the Party that origin-
<col>486</col>
ated it, but in the whole history of land tenure in Ireland. It is a commonplace that the Act was a successful measure. It succeeded because it embodied a recognition of the simple truth that in order to make land purchase successful in Ireland you must make it to the interest of the owner to sell, and to the interest of the would-be owner to buy, and because the transaction between the two parties was absolutely voluntary in character, unattended by any element of partisanship or tyranny or injustice. It was almost, according to my recollection, a solitary instance of legislation by agreement between parties ordinarily widely opposed.<lb/>
I confess, if I may digress for one moment, that I have never been able to understand why that method should not be more commonly applied to the solution of our political difficulties. I am a great believer myself, especially from such administrative experience as I may have had, in round table conferences, and in getting the legs of a body of men differing on questions of principle accommodated under the same mahogany. I never can believe certain questions in our public life that they are ever likely to be satisfactorily solved unless we approach them by some such method. I speak of such questions as education, the liquor question, the extension of the suffrage, and the redistribution of seats, and I would like to add, although I am afraid it is a very Utopian suggestion, the land question both in Ireland and in England. However, I know very well that this is not merely a digression, but that the sentiments I express are Quixotic and probably impracticable. But anyhow, in the case of this measure, there was the fact of achieved agreement between the two parties, and so successful was the Act that it only broke down because of its success. The vendor was there, the purchaser was there, the transaction between them had been concluded, and all that was wanting was the money to finance the transaction to its concluding stages.<lb/>
Now this brief retrospect brings me to my point. Surely, when this stage was reached, it should have been quite possible for a Government, deriving guidance from the immediately previous history of the case, to offer some solution that would have carried on this continuity of agreement between the two parties. All that was required
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0250"/>
<col>487</col>
apparently was a measure which in the first place would have provided, if not permanently, at any rate temporarily, the large sum of money that was required to carry out the financial operations already entered into. It would have relieved the Irish taxpayer of the cost of flotation, which everybody agrees was never meant to be placed upon his shoulders. It would have given wider powers, if they were required&#x2014;though about this there seems to be some doubt&#x2014;to the Congested Districts Board, and it would have prevented the overlapping of functions between that Board and other bodies in Ireland to which reference has more than once been made in this debate Such a Bill, which might have been of modest dimensions, would, I believe, have been received without opposition&#x2014;I cannot speak for the other House of Parliament, but at any rate in the House of Lords&#x2014;and you might have proceeded smoothly and amicably upon your way. Why has the Government not done so? We know the reason perfectly well. It is because such a policy would not have suited the exigencies of the Irish Party. It is not to their interest that the question of land purchase should be settled rapidly and successfully on the lines which I have indicated. Last night I more than once heard these gentlemen spoken of as the supporters of His Majesty's Government. Surely that is a strange inversion of phrase. His Majesty's Government are the supporters of the Irish Party. It is, as I understand, in obedience to the commands of the Irish Party that such a solution has been vetoed, and the whole question of the land system in Ireland is now to be reopened. Thus we arrive at the point that all the best features of Mr. Wyndham's Act of 1903 are in reality to be swept away. I lay stress upon that point because surely it represents the facts.<lb/>
I listened last night with respect, and also with some astonishment, to that part of the speech of the noble Earl in which he defended the introduction of this new scheme. He represented it as a sort of harmless and innocent expansion of the existing law; as if he was a friend of Mr. Wyndham's scheme merely carrying it to its legitimate issues, as if he were a person who was placing, so to speak, a new thatch upon a house into which in the process of time the rains had succeeded in forcing their way. Surely these are not the facts of the case. As I understand it the Bill is as follows.
<col>488</col>
The bonus in Mr. Wyndham's Act has been whittled down substantially even if it has not disappeared; payments in stock have taken the place for the most part of cash; the zones are broken and many people think they are destroyed, and voluntary purchase has been absolutely destroyed. I thought I had here, but I am afraid I have left it behind, a speech from which I had meant to have quoted, by one of the highest of authorities on this matter&#x2014;namely, Mr. William O'Brien. In a debate in the House of Commons which took place in December of last year on the First Reading of this Bill, Mr. O'Brien made a speech in which the phrase occurred that this Bill, so far from being any amplification or expansion of the Act of 1903, would be its absolute destruction and would blow it skyhigh into the air. I accept those words, and count myself safe in sheltering behind such an authority. Those are, as I understand, the destructive and negative features of this scheme, which practically wipes the Act of 1903 out of existence.<lb/>
But now I turn to what is, after all, the immediate purpose, and the more important, namely, the positive and constructive, features of the new scheme. In the first place, reverting to the point that I took up in my opening remarks, you are about to place a new and onerous burden on the British taxpayer. Then you are invited to reopen the whole land question in Ireland, and you are invited to do this in response to an agitation of a most unscrupulous and immoral description, thereby placing a direct premium upon violence and disorder and crime. I might give many proofs of this, but I carry in my mind a resolution which was passed at a certain meeting of the United Irish League in which this Bill was acclaimed as "a triumph for cattle-driving in Ireland." Then in pursuit of your policy, you are attacking and breaking into the one branch of agrarian industry in Ireland&#x2014;the cattle ranches&#x2014;which seems in certain parts of the country to be best suited to the climate and to the needs of the people and which has been prosperous and successful in recent years. In place of that system you are going to set up a new system of small holdings of very doubtful economic value, the applicants for which are to indulge in a sort of headlong scrimmage, the lucky ones in the scrimmage being, as far as I can understand, destitute of any agricultural knowledge in many cases, and probably in a good many cases persons
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0251"/>
<col>489</col>
of very undesirable character. You are asked to abolish the one body which has hitherto covered itself with credit and obtained popular support and esteem in the management of property and sale of land; and finally you propose an expropriation of the rights of owners of the soil such as I venture to say has never been embodied in any legislation of any Parliament in any civilised country in the world. You say to every landlord&#x2014;and surely this is not an exaggeration&#x2014;that he is no longer to be regarded as the owner of the fee simple of his land, but that he is a mere tenant-at-will who may be turned out at any moment, either, in the case of a congested district area by the Congested Districts Board, or in the case of the rest of Ireland, by an official sitting at Dublin.<lb/>
Talk about evicted tenants. You are taking steps to scatter broadcast over Ireland in the future evicted landlords. Perhaps, however, if my language should be thought to savour of exaggeration, I may put the thing a little more clearly by asking you to note the exact character of the proceedings which, as I understand from the Bill, are to take place. It appears to be as follows. The whole of Ireland is to be divided into three parts. One part is to be handed over to the Congested Districts Board; the remaining two-thirds are to be the free playground of the new Estates Commissioners. Those, I think, are the proportions, and you give these bodies over these areas almost unlimited power of compulsory purchase over all estates and untenanted property. Now I come to the way in which it will proceed. Here I am well aware that I am putting a point that has already been submitted by more than one speaker on this side, but speeches of yesterday are apt to be ignored to-day, and I want to get from His Majesty's Government, if possible, an answer to the question whether the procedure I am about to describe is really the procedure meant to be carried out. It will be in the power of somebody, which means anybody, to make a proposal, or to enter into negotiations&#x2014;those are the terms of the Bill&#x2014;with the landlord for the acquisition of his property. Those proposals and those negotiations may be malicious or factitious or illusory, as the case may be. However, we will suppose that they have taken place. The landlord declines the offer, and says he does not want to sell. This fact is then reported to, or somehow or other comes to the notice of, the Estates Commissioners.
<col>490</col>
They then write to the landlord and send him what the Bill with cruel irony describes as their "final offer." I should have thought at this stage we ought to have had the first or preliminary offer. In fact, I doubt whether the word "final" should be in at all. However, they send this final offer to the landlord in writing, and along with this extraordinary document they send the amount of the price which they are willing to give. As far as I can ascertain from the Bill, that price need bear no relation to the value of the property in the neighbourhood, and certainly no relation to the value put on the property by the owner. Among the factors which they are to consider is the price which the tenant or other purchaser&#x2014;the interested party, the grabber&#x2014;may be willing to give. Well, if the landlord, confronted with this final offer, gives way, he is shorn at once of his property. If he declines to accept it, the matter is referred to Dublin or somewhere else, and after a short interval he is equally shorn. I would ask, Is it conceivable, is it credible, that a method of expropriation of rights in land of that description, can seriously be proposed by any responsible Government, or that they can honestly contemplate that it could be included in any measure likely to be passed by any responsible Legislature in Europe? I hope if I have put the case too strongly, I may be pardoned. I have put it strongly because I feel strongly, and with the hope of eliciting some expression of opinion from His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
May I say a word or two further about the case for compulsion? Our attitude on this side of the House is this. What is the case for compulsion? I have been searching for it not merely in the few hours that we have devoted to this discussion, but for weeks past, while I have been studying this question. The first place I went to was the Report of the Dudley Commission. What are the cases in which they recommend compulsion? They talk of one unreasonable person who might block the symmetry of a scheme of resettlement. Their eye is fixed upon an individual&#x2014;a unit. Then I went to the speeches of the Chief Secretary. He talked about compulsion being required, on one occasion he said in particular cases, and on another occasion he said in rare cases. Again we have not got to double figures. Last night the noble Earl the Leader of the House relapsed into the single figure, and talked about a cantankerous landlord. I do not know if he referred to the cantan-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0252"/>
<col>491</col>
kerous landlord as an individual, or spoke about him as typical of a class, but in any case are we not entitled to ask, "Where are these cases? May we not have particulars of them? "And then if they do exist and can be established, are we to believe, because one unrighteous man or five or ten unrighteous men exist, that therefore the whole city, which in this case is the whole country, is to be condemned? And are we really, in order to overcome the obstinacy or recalcitrancy of an individual, or even a small group of individuals, to revolutionise the whole system of land tenure in Ireland?<lb/>
Another point made by the noble Earl was this. He said that compulsion might be necessary in cases where land was actually required for the relief of congestion which could not be relieved in any other way. That case, if it could be established, stands in an entirely different category. If he were able to prove the existence of such cases, the causes for relief being obvious and genuine, the difficulties and impossibility of relief in any other way being established, he would present a <i>bona fide</i> case for the sympathetic consideration of noble Lords in this House. But suppose he were able to prove such cases, surely these are not sufficient justification for the setting up of a great and elaborate machinery, an enormous instrument of intimidation not applied to congested areas alone, not limited, to these cases to which I referred, but as far as I can see extending its tentacles over the whole surface of Ireland. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, if I may say so, really let the cat out of the bag when he used the phrase to which the noble Marquess behind me alluded&#x2014;"the weapon in the background." That is the real explanation of the whole matter. If the would-be purchaser cannot get the terms which he wants, he will enter into the transaction with the consciousness that behind him lies the power of compulsion; and similarly the landlord approaches the negotiations on the other side with the same consciousness, and with fear in his mind. Thus you arrive at this position, that the landlord enters the arena with both hands up, while the tenant enters it with one hand behind his back, and in that hand is concealed the bludgeon of compulsion. I hardly think His Majesty's Government can contemplate that these provisions will pass into law.<lb/>
I should have thought here again that it would have been possible for them to
<col>492</col>
present to Parliament a carefully thought-out proposal, defining the cases in which compulsion might be required, stating, and in all probability strictly limiting, the areas to which it might be applied, defining again the objects for which it was to be enforced, and, above all things, giving the right of appeal to a High Court Judge or to the Court of Appeal. I should have thought that was possible, and if they had done so your Lordships' House would again have been willing to discuss and to consider the matter. But no such provision appears in the Bill, and in its present form I think compulsion is a matter which will receive the approval of but few members of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Now may I turn for a few moments to the question of the Congested Districts Board as illustrating the methods of the Government? I listened last night to many encomiums of the old Congested Districts Board, and the reasons of the success and the popularity of that body are obvious. It was a non-elective body. That is, it was not swayed by those influences that are apt to get the better of men who have constituencies behind them. It was although largely official, a non-departmental body, and it was unaffected by party prejudices and feelings. It had great official experience, and was strong enough to resist any kind of pressure brought to bear upon it, and to give an impartial hearing and a just verdict. This body has enjoyed, as we know, very considerable powers. It possessed an income which was increased by steady increments to &#x00A3;86,000 a year. It possessed very great powers for the purchase and resettlement of land, and for the promotion of Irish industries and agriculture in general. It had under its control 400 electoral divisions in different parts of the country, and it is a matter of common agreement that it played a valuable and a substantial part in the pacification and economic improvement of Ireland. If one wanted proof of that, one might quote even the Chief Secretary himself. I have a passage from a speech he made in the other House on the Irish Councils Bill in 1907, in which he spoke of the Board as&#x2014;
<quote>"probably one of the most useful and one of the most popular bodies in Ireland."</quote>
Nevertheless it is admitted that certain criticisms were made, and legitimately made, upon the operations of this body.

There was what the Dudley Commission described as the duality of administration and the overlapping of functions between it and the Department of Agriculture. There was a sort of mild rivalry that seems to have grown up between this Board and the Land Commission in those parts of Ireland over which both of them enjoyed certain powers of purchase, and it may well have been that a certain rearrangement of areas, a certain redistribution of powers, possibly an amendment in its constitution may have been called for. Well, my Lords, this surely would not have been a very difficult matter. I should have imagined that the principles of readjustment and reconstitution might have been easily embodied in a Bill which would have received the favourable consideration of both Houses of Parliament. But His Majesty's Government would have nothing of the sort. In their passion to destroy, in their deadly partiality for the clean slate, they must wipe out the old Board altogether and set up an entirely new organisation in its place.<lb/>
I would like, if I may, to endeavour to bring home to you the real character of this new organisation which, it is proposed to create. In the first place, it is to be very large, and, I think, unwieldy in numbers, and as we all know the efficiency of these bodies is, as a rule, in inverse ratio to their numerical strength. It will be a body without traditions, possessing little or no training, with little experience in the matters with which the members will be called upon to deal. It is going to be invested with tremendous judicial and executive powers. It will have the distribution of an enormous patronage; it will have the ultimate control of something like forty or fifty millions belonging to the taxpayers in this country; it will distribute from year to year an income of a quarter of a million sterling; it is to have one-third of Ireland, much of which is not congested at all, as the theatre of its operations; it is to be free from Parliamentary control, and as far as I can judge free from any control whatsoever. And this body so composed is to be allowed to expropriate those owners of land in those portions of Ireland to which its authority applies; and in order to make quite sure that this body shall not do the work which is required of it, but shall, on the contrary, reproduce and stereotype the worst features of agrarian strife in Ireland, you go and place in the ascendancy upon it representatives of the
<col>494</col>
very class who hope they will benefit by the operation of its powers, and who in most cases are the agents of the United Irish League.<lb/>
Last night the noble Earl the Leader of the House gave us a defence of this portion of the scheme, and it was, if he will allow me to say so, even more surprising than some other portions of his speech to which I have referred. He said that this new Board was intended to create a <i>modus vivendi,</i> and to reconcile the existing conflict between the congests and the landless men. In other words, they were to be a body of umpires who were to hold the scales even between these contending parties. How is it possible for them to perform this function? Remember, these nine gentlemen are to be returned by the county councils of the congested districts. What is the position? I have obtained the figures of the county councillors in the congested districts in the nine counties to be placed under the Board. They are as follow: Donegal, Nationalists, 28; Unionists, 4; Clare, Nationalists, 29; Unionists, 0; Kerry, Nationalists, 30; Unionists, 0; Cork, of which four rural areas are to be declared congested, Nationalists, 49; Unionists, 0; Sligo, Nationalists, 26; Unionists, 0; Leitrim, Nationalists, 23; Unionists, 1; Roscommon, Nationalists, 29; Unionists, 0; Mayo, Nationalists, 33; Unionists, 0; Galway, Nationalists, 31; Unionists, 1. In other words, the approximate total in the county councils in these areas over which these enormous powers are to exist shows Nationalists, 278; and Unionists, 6. Now these gentlemen who are returned as Nationalists are, as everybody knows, members or supporters of the United Irish League, and as such they support the policy of the League. Now what is the policy of the League with regard to this matter? I could quote scores of passages in which the views of the United Irish League about congests and landless men have been stated in the most uncompromising terms. In this and in the other House of Parliament the congests are presented to us as a body, as they are, of innocent and meritorious persons who, by reason of their poverty, ought to be given some better proportion of parts of the soil in Ireland. But if you go to the meetings of the United Irish League they are described as outsiders, aliens, planters, land-grabbers, who are deserving of no sympathy
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0254"/>
<col>495</col>
and will receive no mercy at their hands. Therefore the whole efforts of the United Irish League and the county councils whom they return, and of the representative members of the new Board who will be returned by the county councils, will be directed to the settlement of this question in the direction of deciding against the congests and in favour of the landless men. How is it possible under these circumstances to describe these persons as umpires who are capable of holding the scales even? If they are umpires at all, they will be like the umpires we are familiar with at local village cricket matches who always give their own side "in." I need not labour this part of the scheme, because it has been absolutely pulverised in his Minute of Dissent by Lord MacDonnell, who sits opposite. I believe the noble Lord is going to follow me in the debate, and I hope that he will repeat for the benefit of your Lordships the opinions which he has there expressed upon this subject. I will only say that in handling the Bill I do hope that this new Board, with its enormous powers and its great capacity for danger, will disappear altogether from the measure.<lb/>
In the remarks that I have made on this Bill I have not dealt with the details, because I am not competent to deal with any of the more minute features of the measure requiring local knowledge, of which I am destitute. I have only ventured to call attention to one or two outstanding features of the measure which I hope your Lordships will alter with no trembling or uncertain hand. I altogether dispute the proposition that either the Peers in this House from Ireland, or the Peers on this side who represent England, are partisans in this matter. We are all of us just as anxious for the settlement of land purchase in Ireland; indeed, I think the Irish Peers must be more so than any Members of your Lordships' House. We are as much interested in the relief of congestion and in measures for settling upon the land the poor and miserable class to whom reference has been so often made. It is to the interest of every Irish Peer and also of every English Peer to see grow up in Ireland a strong, solid, solvent peasant proprietary in the future. Neither we nor those on the opposite side of the House make any claim to a monopoly of sympathy or patriotism or even of self-interest in the matter. We are all equally concerned in arriving at a successful, and, if possible, an amicable
<col>496</col>
issue. But there is one plea by which I hope your Lordships will not allow yourselves to be influenced. I refer to the threats, of which we hear so much, of what will happen if this Bill is not passed by your Lordships in its present form.<lb/>
We have been openly told by Mr. Dillon, who is the real <i>de facto</i> leader in these matters, that if this Bill is seriously modified he will "cry 'havoc' and let slip the dogs of war." I have no doubt that in his hands those animals are under excellent discipline, and that they will obey, as they have done before, the orders of their keeper. But I hope you will not be in the least bit disturbed or diverted by these threats, but that you will go calmly on your way with the consideration of this Bill. After all, the real issue at stake is not the transient experiences of the forthcoming winter but the future through a long vista of years. If this Bill, by prudent compromise and by careful revision in this House, can be shaped into a suitable measure, I am sure your Lordships on this side will be only too anxious to do it. If you fail in your efforts, or if your propositions are treated with contumely in another place, and if in consequence of anything that you may do His Majesty's Government should decide to drop this measure, then I venture to say the responsibility will be not yours but theirs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01561"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I came down to the House this evening in great expectation that I should hear from the noble Lord some information, and receive some guidance, as to how this complex matter should be dealt with. I am no stranger to the noble Lord's remarkable power of unravelling the most tangled skeins of revenue procedures and of rent laws; and I am a witness of the ardent desire which has always animated him to hold the scales of justice evenly between the owners of the soil and the toiling millions who cultivate it. But as the noble Lord's speech proceeded my hopes were clouded; phrases and allusions fell from his fluent lips which will leave their sting in Ireland. Nothing that he says gives any due as to how this <i>impasse</i> into which we have been led can be dealt with. A feeling oppresses me that although Ireland has the honour of counting him among her Peers, he has in no way entered into the feelings of those to whom a speedy ending of the land war in Ireland is almost a matter of life and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0255"/>
<col>497</col>
death. With great regret I say that I find in the noble Lord's speech no foundation upon which to build my own arguments.<lb/>
It is also with great regret that I find, myself on this occasion differing from my noble friend Lord Dunraven. For several years now I have had the great good fortune of being admitted to my noble friend's confidence and of discussing with him the various phases of Irish affairs. I think I speak with entire accuracy when I say that in no point of aim or object have we ever differed, although we may have differed as to the means by which our objects might be attained,. In this particular case, I do not think there is any difference in object between my noble friend and, myself. The difference lies in this, that he can trust the Government to make no such changes in this Bill as will make it acceptable to the people of Ireland. I, on the other hand, think the Bill is capable of amendment, that the amendments are not very great and should be introduced into it before it leaves your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I have heard with surprise and deep regret the remarks that have been made during the debate belittling the Act of 1903. I believe my noble friend Lord St. David's said that the best thing to do was to repeal the Act. I had the privilege of taking a share in the preparation of that Act, and I wish to offer to your Lordships some remarks regarding it before I proceed to deal with the Bill before the House.<lb/>
It is well known to all Members of your Lordships' House that the Irish land difficulty is one of very old standing. For more than half a century Act after Act was passed to restore order or to produce order from disorder in Irish land affairs, but not one of that long sequence of Acts succeeded in laying the foundations of settled peace, or in avoiding hardship to one side or the other. It was during the debates on the Land Act of 1881, I think, that it occurred to the mind of that great Statesman, the late Mr. Bright, that perhaps a solution of the Irish land difficulty might be found in the abolition of rent altogether, by enabling the tenant to buy out his landlord. Provisions were introduced into the Act of 1881 giving effect to that proposal, and. these provisions were enlarged in the Act of 1896, with which the name of my noble and learned friend Lord Ashbourne is so honourably connected. Time passed on, and it became an accepted belief in
<col>498</col>
Ireland that only in an extension of land purchase could a solution of this longstanding difficulty be found. Accordingly the Act of 1903 was passed. It was passed amidst universal approval. What has been the result of that Act? In the last Report of the Estates Commissioners it is shown that the total of transactions from November 1, 1903, to March 31, 1909, amounted to &#x00A3;78,661,011. In the six months which have elapsed since March 31 last, further sales and transfers have taken place, so that at the present time more than eighty million pounds worth of land in Ireland has passed from landlord to tenant. If it be remembered also that under the previous Land Acts of 1881 and 1896 land valued at twenty-three million pounds was also sold, your Lordships will see that as the whole land of Ireland is, I believe, valued at under &#x00A3;200,000,000, more than half the saleable land in Ireland has already been sold under the Land Purchase Acts. From the tenants' point of view that is a great achievement, but far greater than the mere money figures indicate is the change that has come over the Irish people in the tracts in which land purchase has operated. It requires that you should, go amongst the people, that you should compare their state now with the state of their neighbours who have not bought, to perceive the change that has taken place in the disposition of the people. Under the operation of this Land Purchase Act a spirit of industry, of contentment, and, of loyalty has grown up which is the highest testimony to the success of the policy of the Act of 1903.<lb/>
I have heard during this debate this policy measured in pounds, shillings, and pence. What pecuniary standard of measure can you apply to a beneficial change in the disposition of an entire people?<lb/>
Where does the difficulty occur which you have been called upon here to face? We have been told that the Bill in the first place destroys the zones. I venture to think that those who have said that have not read the Bill with the carefulness which it deserves. Section 14, upon which the criticism is based, must not be read by itself alone; it must be taken also with Section 20. But let me consider what force there is in this charge that the zones are being destroyed. I agree with those who say that if the zones had been destroyed a very serious injury would have been inflicted upon land purchase in Ireland.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0256"/>
<col>499</col>
It is stated that the zones are the cause of the high prices which have prevailed under the Act of 1903. Nothing could be more fallacious. The high prices that have prevailed since 1903 are due to the low interest which the Act of 1903 introduced compared with the higher rates of interest which prevailed under the Acts of 1881 and 1896. I am not prepared to say that the zones may not have in some degree contributed to that, but that they were not the main contributory cause is, I think, clearly demonstrated.<lb/>
Now what does Section 14 say? It says that in certain circumstances the Estates Commissioners must make inquiry as to "the security for the advance" or "the equity of the price." These are the two things which have to be taken separately. As to the security for the advance, I am quite aware that under the system which is known by the term "zone," the purchase price is based upon judicial rents, and so far, there is a security and an assurance that the price is such that the State can with safety advance. But there are certain cases in which agreements are made out of Court. They are registered in Court as judicial rents, and purchase agreements are founded upon them. These agreements do not pass under the scrutiny of the Courts, and do not give the same assurance which judicial decisions give as to their sufficiency in the interests of the taxpayer. All that the first portion of this section provides is that where the Estates Commissioners shall be satisfied that there is a danger to the taxpayer, they shall make inquiry and see that no improper methods have been adopted in fixing the price. In regard to the equity of the price, as I read the section, there is no intention of going behind any agreement which landlord and tenant make with each other. In Section 20 it is stated that the Estates Commissioners must inquire as to whether the improvements which the tenant has made in his holding have been included, whether the price has been based upon improvements which the tenant has made in his holding, and for which he has not been compensated by the landlord. This is purely a matter for discussion in Committee. I cannot, of course, speak for His Majesty's Government, but I am sure if there is any clear contradiction between the two parts of the Bill in this respect the matter will be corrected.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the question
<col>500</col>
of finance. The purchase money under this Bill may be divided into three classes. There is, first, a sum of money which has been paid for land that has already been bought. That, at the present time, amounts to thirty millions, and in regard to that no loss whatever has fallen upon His Majesty's Treasury. The costs of floating that thirty millions&#x2014;the average cost was twelve per cent.&#x2014;was &#x00A3;3,600,000, and upon that an annuity of three and a-quarter per cent. interest and sinking fund has been met from the Ireland Development Grant. That grant is purely Irish money; and the corresponding and equivalent amounts which were given to England and Scotland are being utilised for their proper object in the promotion of primary education in those countries. But in neither of those countries is the necessity for primary education more manifest than in Ireland; yet, in order to finance the Irish Land Act, the Treasury have diverted this amount of &#x00A3;185,000 from its legitimate purpose. And yet allegations are made that the Irish people are not to be relied on to pay their debts. I repudiate that imputation in the strongest terms.<lb/>
The next sum I come to is the fifty millions which is the amount necessary to finance pending agreements which are deposited in the Estates Commissioners' Office. It is quite clear that the costs of flotation of this sum must be either borne by the Treasury or must fall upon the Irish ratepayers. I heard it stated last night in the course of the debate that the Irish ratepayers are under a strict bond to pay this money. What is the origin of this obligation? When the Act of 1881 was introduced, and again when the Act of 1896 was passed, a guarantee fund was made a part of the financial system of both Acts. In 1881 the interest on Consols had not been reduced, and Consols were at par. In 1896 the interest on Consols had been reduced to two and three-quarters per cent., and the price was 109. No suspicion ever crossed any one's mind that any obligation or liability was imported or connoted by the existence in those Acts of the guarantee fund, and when the Act of 1903 was passed the provisions of the previous Act were incorporated in it, but nobody at that time throught that any obligation would fall upon Irish taxpayers than had fallen on them under the previous Acts. But I need not labour this point, because the common-sense of both Houses
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0257"/>
<col>501</col>
recognised that upon no grounds of justice or honour could this obligation be imposed upon the Irish people. Quite properly, the Treasury came forward and said "We will take upon our own shoulders this cost of floating the fifty million pounds." Therefore in regard to that the account is clear.<lb/>
The Irish people are grateful to His Majesty's Government for what they have done. Only in one particular do I think this settlement in regard to the fifty million pounds is a little hard. Under the terms of the Act the landlords are entitled to be paid in cash, but under the arrangements made by the Treasury only five millions in cash is to be floated every year. I make no complaint against the Treasury. I do not say that in 1903 any suggestion was held out that a greater amount of money would be raised in any other year than five millions. What Mr. Wyndham said was to the effect that "in the first three years of the Act we will not throw upon the market more than five millions, but we hope to quicken the pace a little later on, so that the whole transaction of &#x00A3;100,000,000 will be dealt with in fifteen or sixteen years." That meant that in no particular year of the fifteen or sixteen years would a larger sum of money than five or six millions, or perhaps seven millions, be raised. For my own part, I make no complaint against the Treasury on that account, but the position now in regard to the Irish Landlords is that many of them will have to wait eight or ten years before they get payment of their money, and as many of these landlords are indebted landlords, paying perhaps five per cent. interest while receiving three and a-half, I say their position is one of cruel hardship. I also say that I think they have just grounds for an appeal to the Government to give them better terms than those which the Bill incorporates. The Bill seems to suppose that Irish Land Stock should never get above ninety-two, but it is now at eighty-five, so that if any Irish landlord takes the option of payment in stock, he loses straight way something like seven per cent. That is a point on which I think Irish landlords in this general settlement, as I hope this will be, of the Irish land question, could make, with considerable reason, an appeal to the Government.<lb/>
Now I pass on to the final part, the finances of this Bill. The noble Earl the Leader of the House put the future purchases at
<col>502</col>
&#x00A3;70,000,000, although I shall not be much surprised if they do not cost &#x00A3;90,000,000. The position is this, and here I have to deal with the question of compulsion. The key of the situation in dealing with this matter is the issue of stock at three per cent. It is perfectly clear that the only way this enormous sum of &#x00A3;90,000,000 can be advanced is either by throwing the cost of flotation on the Treasury, by throwing it on the Irish people, or by issuing three per cent. stock, which means throwing it on the landlords. The Treasury refused to accept any further liability, and I am not here to say that they should. The Irish people refuse, and you cannot enforce it in this case, seeing that you have abandoned it in the other. Only the third way remains. Now what happens? When an agreement to sell is proposed between landlord and tenant, the latter will say "I am willing to buy, but I will only buy at the price which my neighbours have paid." Take the case of a tenant with a &#x00A3;100 holding. That tenant will buy under existing terms at three and a-quarter per cent., say at twenty-three years purchase. His landlord is to get &#x00A3;2,300. The tenant's annuity is three and a-quarter per cent. on that, which, I think, is &#x00A3;75. If this Bill should pass in its present state, no tenant will give more than &#x00A3;75 for the same kind of property, which means that the three and a-half per cent. imports no greater charge on him than the three and a-quarter did to his neighbour. How is that to be met? It cannot be met. It is one of the deterrents to land purchase.<lb/>
I wish to be perfectly clear and state the deterrents on the one side and the arguments for and against, and then I will give my own conclusions. If this Bill passes in its present shape every landlord may have to sell at from one and a-half to two years purchase less than before. I do not think that is a very great hardship, because I agree with my noble friend Lord Dunraven in thinking that Irish landlords, on the whole, have bought from one to two years purchase too high, and the raising of the annuity to three and a-half per cent. will automatically effect a reduction which in my opinion ought to be effected. What is the other deterrent? When the landlord takes his three per cent. stock and throws it on the market, he will get &#x00A3;97 or &#x00A3;96 per cent. for it. Local stock is selling in the market at ninety-seven and though this stock will
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0258"/>
<col>503</col>
cease to be called Irish Land Stock, and will be called Guaranteed Stock, and thereby will secure a higher price in the market, it still will sell at some few pounds of discount. That is the second deterrent element which this Bill has introduced to the landlords. The third deterrent is the bonus. The bonus as at present drawn penalises the owner of good land in order that the owner of bad land may get more than its value. These reasons combine to deter the landlord from selling under this Bill. What will then happen? If the compulsory provisions of this Bill remain, landlords will have recourse to them. If the Bill remains unaltered, the landlords must have recourse to them. I agree with everything that was said last night to the tendency which this Bill will have to prevent dealings of an amicable nature, that it will all tend to compulsion. The tribunal that you have under the Bill could be changed probably, as the landlords would insist (and if they did I would support them), in asking for a Judicial Commission and the two Judges of the High Court, not that I mistrust the tribunal of the Bill. Such a tribunal would give the landlords as high a price in my opinion as they deserve. I agree with my noble friend Lord Dunraven in thinking that there ought to be for the landlords no terror and no dread in the idea of compulsion. During the time I was engaged in assisting Mr. Wyndham in preparing the Act of 1903 I had many conversations with all the more important landlords of Ireland, and with one especially, an extremely prudent and far-seeing man, the late O'Conor Don. He was entirely in favour of compulsion, and I myself do think that if the landlords could get over their objection to the word compulsion it would be to their entire interest under this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01562"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Lord will pardon me for interrupting, but I should like to hear the occasion on which the O'Conor Don, a very old friend of mine, said that he was in favour of compulsion, or used words to that effect?</membercontribution></p>

When the Bill was first Introduced in 1903, he did not like it altogether, and said, "I should prefer a compulsory measure as no doubt in that case the sum that the landlord was to receive would be put into the Act."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01567"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: I have no remembrance of that, but I can assure your Lordships that this is a matter on which my recollection is absolutely precise. I have had several conversations with him in which he always insisted that compulsory purchase would have been an advantage to the Irish landlords. However, the matter is not of great importance. But what would happen if a general scheme of compulsory purchase was accepted by the landlords? Under this Bill His Majesty's Government would have to raise seventy or ninety millions in cash; they would have to pay the cost of flotation on the whole of that sum; they would have to give prompt payment, because it is not to be supposed that the State could expropriate the owner of an estate and refuse to pay for it. Let me point to another difficulty that is raised but has not been noticed in the course of this debate. In making a proposal leading up to a compulsory purchase, the Estates Commissioners, who buy only to resell, would have to find out from the tenants in some way or other what they were willing to give for their holdings. Say that the tenants agreed to give &#x00A3;10,000 for an estate, and say that on appeal to the judicial tribunal the landlord was awarded &#x00A3;12,000. The Land Commission could not retreat, having instituted these proceedings, so then they would be left with a property worth &#x00A3;12,000, for which the tenants were only willing to give &#x00A3;10,000. Then there would have to be another compulsion. You would have to bring compulsion on the tenants to buy. If you did bring compulsion on the tenants, you would be sowing a seed which in a very short time would produce the poisonous crop of repudiation. These considerations suggest to me that this proposal for compulsory purchase should be cut out of the Bill in the interests of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0259"/>
<col>505</col>
the Treasury alone. If the landlords wish it to be cut out I should support them, although I do not think they are wise in wishing to have it cut out. But if the Treasury wish to maintain it, I should begin to doubt the sanity of the Treasury. That is all I have to say on the question of finance.<lb/>
I have troubled your Lordships at very considerable length, but before I sit down I wish to say one word regarding the Congested Districts Board. I entirely concur in what my noble friend Lord Dunraven said as to the necessity of representative institutions in Ireland. I have said so in the Minute which I felt bound to record on the Report of the Congestion Committee, but in my opinion this Board is eminently not one for a representative element. This is a Board which deals with the expropriation of the landlords in a large part of Ireland, and it would not be fair to the landlords to have that great work carried through by any body except one whose impartiality and competence were beyond reproach. I was for five or six years on the Congested Districts Board, and conducted its business in the intervals of its sittings. I think I ought to know everything connected with every branch of that Board, and I say without any hesitation that if you put on to it a representative majority selected from the county councils in the Western Counties&#x2014;I do not cast any imputation upon the character of these men, some of whom ought to be appointed nominated members of the Board&#x2014;appointed by election, and therefore having to work up to the dictates and to the wishes of their constituents, you will have a Board remarkable for its inefficiency.<lb/>
On this question of the Congested Districts Board I have three suggestions to make. I think, in the first place, that all the purchases of land in Ireland should be concentrated in the hands of one body, the Estates Commissioners, who have now an unrivalled experience in purchasing land in Ireland, and who, as far as I am enabled to know, have given general satisfaction. It is fatal to economy in the purchase of land to maintain two standards, and if you maintain the Congested Districts Board as a purchasing authority you will have two standards in the future as in the past, but even more divergent than they have been, because the Congested
<col>506</col>
Districts Board in the past was always responsive to the suggestions of the Under-Secretary and of the Chief Secretary. The second suggestion is this. All the functions which are now exercised by the Congested Districts Board, and for which a special department has been created&#x2014;namely, agriculture, fisheries and industries&#x2014;should be transferred from the Board to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. The third suggestion is that the Board should be restricted to its present area, and that its operations should not be extended to the whole West of Ireland.<lb/>
I have stated officially and publicly that the method of administration followed by the Board is not as productive of that strength of character as that of the Estates Commissioners. There always seems to me to have been too much spoon feeding in the method of administration by the Board. What we want in the West of Ireland is to put people as soon as we can on their own resources, and let them work out their own salvation. They are doing that under the auspices of the Estates Commissioners, who also deal with congestion as well as the Board. It was perfectly possible to compare the two methods of working and the results, and the conclusion which was borne in upon me was that there could be no hesitation in making a choice between the two. The last point I have to say is about the elective element. I need not repeat what I have said, but should your Lordships, as I sincerely hope you will, send this Bill to Committee, I shall be prepared, if no other noble Lord will take the duty, to place upon the Paper such Amendments as will, in my opinion, convert this Bill into a useful and beneficial supplement to the great Act of 1903, into a Bill which would help even further to lay the foundations of prosperity in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0003P0I0260"/>
<col>507</col>
and by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. In the first instance the two noble Lords queried whether there had been adequate discussion in the House of Commons, and Lord Dunraven said he considered the lack of discussion a sufficient reason for the rejection of the Bill. On the other hand, the noble Marquess considered it quite the opposite, and thought it a reason for au adequate discussion in this House.<lb/>
I have had a comparison made of the actual time spent on the Bill of 1903 as compared with the present Bill in the House of Commons. The Bill of 1903 took in all sixteen days. This Bill took thirteen days, without including two days which were spent on the Bill last autumn. The compulsory clauses we are told were guillotined. I cannot find that this is the case. I noticed that the compulsory clause, which I suppose is generally taken as Clause 64, was discussed during the whole day on the eighth day of the Committee. I am also informed that discussions in Committee took more or less the form of a Second Reading debate. For instance, on the first day they had the new rate of annuity; on the second day, the new three per cent. stock, and incidentally the making up of differences between land and consols; on the third day, bonuses and landless men; and up to the sixth day was spent on the constitution of the Board and compulsory purchase. So I do not think it can with justice be said that this Bill has received no consideration in another place.<lb/>
Lord Lansdowne said that he considered landlords who had not yet been paid suffered a very real grievance from the dilatoriness of the Government in this respect. There is no doubt about that. Irish landlords, and I myself among them, have suffered very much from not being paid in time. We have often had large mortgages to pay, often paying four to five per cent., while getting only three and a-half. But it must be remembered that under the Act of 1896 all landlords who elected to sell their estates must of necessity have known that there would be a very large block before they could be paid. That was common knowledge as early as 1896, and I think Mr. Walter Long recognised that when he brought in the Bill to which reference has already been made. When
<col>508</col>
the present Government came into office they were faced with this difficulty&#x2014;what was it possible to do? The Irish Development Grant was very nearly exhausted, and therefore all the cost of flotation must fall on the Irish ratepayer. The noble Lord said this was only a technical mistake. It is not a mistake, because it is the law of the land, and has been supported by the Law Officers on both sides. The Treasury are going to take over the whole of these undertakings in this Bill. They will take over the fifty-three millions, and, in addition, take over the expenses with regard to the flotation and the bonus. Your Lordships will understand that if it had been possible to raise money at three and three-quarters at par, there would have been no necessity for this Bill, but the difficulty now is that such a thing is not possible, and the only possibility of placing the finances of this Bill on some sort of sound basis is, I think, by the suggestion that in future land purchased in Ireland will be self-supporting, and that stock will be paid to landlords at the rate of three per cent. Arrangements must be come to between landlord and tenant with regard to this.<lb/>
The noble Lord said he hoped it would be possible to accelerate the payment of this fifty-three millions. It may be possible, and it is likely that the present staff of the Estate Commissioners will be more or less increased so as to allow of a larger amount of stock being paid each year. With regard to the zones, the noble Marquess said they were virtually torn up by this Bill and done away with. I do not think that is quite correct. We all know what use they have been in Ireland, and there is no intention on the part of His Majesty's Government of doing away with zones. What they do is this&#x2014;they simply leave to the Estate Commissioners a discretionary power by which they can, if they are dissatisfied with any particular arrangement or undertaking with regard to an estate, inquire into and see that the State has proper security for its money.<lb/>
Lord Ashbourne asked if we could bring forward any case in which fictitious value was being asked for. I have looked the matter up and have found one case. An owner agreed to sell to his tenants at a certain price. He arranged with the tenants that a further sum was to be added to the agreed price, and as soon as he had
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0261"/>
<col>509</col>
received payment himself he would hand over this further sum to the tenants, so that the object of the arrangement was that both vendor and tenant should receive an ulterior benefit. The vendor would receive twelve per cent. and the tenants would receive a sum in cash. It was believed that a great many cases of this sort existed in Ireland, and it was for this reason that the present clause in this Bill was drafted so as to give the Estates Commissioners general discretionary power to examine into any given estate. Lord Ashbourne also raised a point with regard to compulsion. He stated that in the event of compulsion being exercised, the Estates Commissioners had a perfect right to schedule and purchase any land which was already purchased under the Acts of 1886 or 1891.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01569"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: No, I think it was Lord Dunraven.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01570"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble and learned Lord's pardon; but that remark was made in the course of the debate last night. I have inquired into that, and I find that land already bought and paying an annuity is not subject to this Act to any extent at all, and neither the Estates Commissioners nor any person in Ireland can purchase land which is already paying annuity. I have the quotation here, but if Lord Ashbourne does not think it is stringent enough we will make that perfectly clear. There has been a great deal said about compulsion. Several noble Lords seem to think that the Estates Commissioners are going to acquire land all over the country. That is not the case at all. The Estates Commissioners will exercise their powers very sparingly indeed. Lord MacDonnell gave a very good instance. He said the Estates Commissioners might propose to buy an estate and their final offer might be &#x00A3;10,000. The landlord would appeal against that, and on its going to the Judicial Commissioners they might award him &#x00A3;12,000, but the tenants would refuse to exceed the price of &#x00A3;10,000. What is going to happen? Who is going to pay the extra &#x00A3;2,000? It is obvious that the Treasury will not. It falls on the county. That in itself would not make the compulsory clauses very popular. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, made reference to the fact that any person could put into force the compulsory powers
<col>510</col>
of the Estates Commissioners. That, I understand, is an error. The noble Marquess shakes his head. I will give him a justification for my remark&#x2014;I have lost the reference for a moment, but I will come back to it. I am informed that any person wishing to put compulsory powers into force must of himself be a tenant within the meaning of the Act. That, I am informed, is the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01571"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: It is wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01572"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: I am informed that that is the case, that he must be a tenant within the meaning of the Act. The noble and learned Lord also said that great dissatisfaction would be caused in Ireland by the different rates tenants would have to pay, that under the present Act they only paid two and three-quarters, whilst under the future Act they would be paying three and a-half. My Lords, there has been no trouble so far with regard to that; there are a great many tenants who have purchased under the Ashbourne Act and who are paying three and one-eighth, and there has been no trouble there. An Irishman's one wish is to acquire land. Every time he pays an instalment towards the purchase of land he gets nearer the goal of his ambition, and I do not think that he really cares whether he pays three and a-half or three and one-eighth or three and three-quarters per cent.<lb/>
I will now touch very briefly on the compulsory powers so far as they affect the Congested Districts Board. I am sorry that Lord MacDonnell is so averse to the composition of this Board. I think it has always been recognised that compulsory powers were absolutely necessary in that part of the country, and I would venture to quote from the Annual Report of the Congested Districts Board for the year 1894&#x2013;5 on that point. This Report was made to my noble Friend the present Secretary of State for India&#x2014;
<quote>"The Congested Districts Board are in possession of information that there are large tracts of land that may be used to enlarge the holdings of small occupiers and to promote schemes for migration from congested districts. The Board cannot give effect to this important department of their work unless more funds are placed at their disposal and compulsory powers given to them to acquire lands at their just values."</quote>
The Report goes on to say that large powers are desirable to give effect to such
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0262"/>
<col>511</col>
schemes on a large scale. This Report was signed by Mr. Gerald Balfour and by Mr. Arthur Balfour, who was also a member of the Board. The noble and learned Lord asked whether I could produce any evidence of the necessity for compulsory powers in the congested district area. I have been able to find some very interesting cases in that respect. During the existence of the Congested Districts Board there have been thirty-two cases in which landlords have refused the Board's offers for their estates, totalling to as much as &#x00A3;318,000; 103 cases of refusal to sell grass land, and in no fewer than 244 cases owners have given no reply whatsoever to the circular asking whether they were willing to sell their land or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01573"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Would the noble Lord give the dates? I pointed to cases within the last twelve months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01574"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: The answer to that is that during the last twelve months the Congested Districts Board have had no money with which to offer to buy anything.

From this Report there is no doubt that in certain parts of Ireland compulsion to a certain degree may be necessary. I think most noble Lords will agree to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01581"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: No, not one.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01584"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: That is very just. But there are a great many cases where the Congested Districts Board will want to get a certain bit of land in a particular district, and if they cannot acquire that by compulsory power what are they to do? It is beside the point to say that they could get land elsewhere; the point is that they want land in a particular district.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01587"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Is that to be taken from the money already asked for, &#x00A3;56,000,000, or where is it to come from?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01589"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: From what und?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01590"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: I am not perfectly certain on that point. Noble Lords have also taken very great exception to the composition of the Congested Districts Board; they have said they objected very strongly to the elective element therein. No one seems to have touched on the point that the administrative committee of the Board had entire control of the finance. There are four permanent and two elected members of that committee. Although the Board may suggest some policy to the administrative committee, that committee will not sanction it unless they like. They are a sort of small Treasury; they have absolute power in that respect. I think noble Lords take a wrong view especially with regard to that elective element.<lb/>
There is one question with regard to Clause 17 of the Bill with which I wish to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0263"/>
<col>513</col>
deal&#x2014;namely, with respect to the landless men. Landless men, as my noble friend behind me stated, are a product, or a by-product rather, of the Act of 1903. Before that time no one had ever heard of a landless man. Particularly, great objection is taken to subsection (<i>e</i>) of that clause because noble Lords from Ireland seem to think that the Estates Commissioners can put anybody down on the land under this provision. That is the last thing which the Estates Commissioners wish to do. The Estates Commissioners have taken this power simply to be able to deal with the residues of estates. The residue of an estate may be left which is not suitable for a tenant farmer, and it is simply in order to be able to deal with that that this has been inserted. If noble Lords do not think it practicable and we are forced to it we are perfectly willing to meet them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01591"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: That is to leave out the landless men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01592"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: No; it is subsection (<i>e</i>) that is objected to, because it is said that any person can be put on the land under it. That is not the wish of the Estates Commissioners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01593"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Are the Government willing to strike out the reference to the landless men?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01594"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: There is very little difference really in respect to landless men in this Bill from the Act of 1903. The Act of 1903 allowed tenants' sons to purchase, and this Bill allows tenants' sons and also people in the neighbourhood to purchase. I do not think there is very much to cavil at there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01595"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01596"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: I have dealt as far as I can with most of the points which have been raised by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, and the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven. I am glad to hear that your Lordships propose giving this Bill a Second Reading. I am sure this Bill will, as any noble friend Lord Mac Donned said, do a lot to further the prosperity of Ireland. We all agree&#x2014;all of us who are going to live in Ireland&#x2014;that without land purchase there, and without the peasant becoming the proprietor of his
<col>514</col>
land, there is very little hope of any ultimate settlement or rest in that country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01597"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to correct a misstatement which was made, I presume unknowingly, by the noble Earl who has just sat down. The noble Earl said that Mr. Arthur Balfour and Mr. Gerald Balfour both approved of conferring compulsory powers on the Congested Districts Board. That is absolutely inaccurate, and in my hearing has been contradicted by both those gentlemen times innumerable. I have in my pocket a letter from Mr. Gerald Balfour, received only this morning, in which he repeats his statement that nothing of the kind occurred. What did occur was this. At a certain meeting of the Congested Districts Board, at a time when Mr. Arthur Balfour was chairman of the Board, the Board in his absence passed a resolution that it was desirable that they should have compulsory powers. At a subsequent meeting at which Mr. Gerald Balfour was present, the report referring to this resolution came up for consideration, and he, as chairman, was obliged to sign the minutes of the meeting, as every chairman is&#x2014;a signature which does not at all express approval of the course taken at any previous meeting, but merely authenticates the minutes and nothing more. That has been stated again and again, and I believe it is to be found in the evidence of Mr. Gerald Balfour before the Dudley Commission. It is entirely inaccurate to say that either of those gentlemen on any occasion expressed an opinion that it was desirable to confer compulsory powers on the Congested Districts Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01598"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Amendment before your Lordships' House is that this Bill should be read a second time this day three months. I do not at all agree with the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, who has moved that Amendment, but I feel I cannot give a silent vote upon this Bill for the reason that there are two financial provisions in it which I think cannot be ignored. The first is the one which relieves the ratepayers of Ireland from any further liability. I should like to read what the leader of the Nationalist Party, Mr. Joho Redmond, said upon this subject:&#x2014;
<quote>"Therefore, so far as we are concerned" [that is, the Nationalist Party] "we could not put any obstacles in the path of this Bill, If there was
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0264"/>
<col>515</col>
nothing else in it at all except this question of congestion, if there was nothing else in the Bill except the lifting off from the shoulders of the ratepayers of Ireland &#x00A3;500,000 or &#x00A3;600,000 a year, which is the alternative of stopping land purchase altogether, it would be impossible for us to stand in the way of its passage into law &#x2026; &#x2026; but there are many other things of great value to it in Ireland."</quote>
There we come to the parting of the ways. There are other things which he thinks of great value to Ireland in the Bill but this House does not agree with him.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, for the Bill. You are all aware that this is the second session of the Bill, and it differs but little from the Bill of 1908. I am not going to waste your Lordships' time in seeking for epithets or adjectives with which to abuse the Government for the way in which the Bill was rushed through the House of Commons, but the tone of its originators was "Take it and swallow it," and all Amendments of a reasonable and drastic nature were walked to a quick death in the Division Lobbies of the other House. The Bill before us contains two principles&#x2014;the continuation of land purchase but under compulsion, and the dealing with congestion in Ireland. The first has resolved itself really into a financial question and nothing else; the second is an economic one which we all know carries with it certain financial provisions. I should like to say something on the first.<lb/>
Every Land Act in Ireland dealing in any way with the transfer of land from the landowner to the tenant has been carried out on the voluntary system, and from the time that Mr. Bright forty years ago brought in these proposals up till the last Act, the Wyndham Act of 1903, that system has been successful. The money advanced by the State has been punctually paid back by the tenants in Ireland. They have met their debts almost to the uttermost farthing, and we therefore on those grounds only, because these debts have been paid, begin to really think that the voluntary system has been a success. The noble Earl in his speech when bringing in the Bill said&#x2014;
<quote>"I put this Bill forward as what the Americans call 'a business proposition.'"</quote>
I should like to ask the noble Earl whether it is a fair business proposition to pay in paper, in stock, and not in gold. He said that &#x00A3;2,000,000 was to be paid in
<col>516</col>
cash and &#x00A3;2,000,000 partly in cash and partly in stock. I do not see that in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01599"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: No, it is not in the Bill. But I rise to correct a slight inaccuracy in the statement of the noble Earl. It is &#x00A3;2,000,000 in cash and &#x00A3;2,000,000 in stock for those who are prepared to take half of each&#x2014;&#x00A3;4,000,000 in all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01600"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Yes, they can take cash if they like, but we all know they will have to wait a very long time for that cash. The Chief Secretary has very often said things to smooth over the matter, and, as my noble friend Lord Curzon said, to glide over the currents and the dangerous pools, but we want to see it in the Bill, and then when we come to a later stage the matter can be discussed. The noble Earl said that the Act of 1903 was carried through Parliament in a burst of generosity, and that everybody shook each other's hand and drank each other's health, etc., etc., and we were all as happy as possible. I should like to ask the noble Earl if he ever read the speech of Mr. Bowles, the Member for Lynn Regis. Also Mr. Coghill in his speech abused the Bill in every possible way and talked of its being "a raid on the British Treasury." I do not think that is an instance of generosity, and I think the noble Earl rather overstated the matter in that respect.<lb/>
I should now like to say a word with regard to what the noble Lord, Lord St. David's, said yesterday. He concluded his speech by saying that no one in the course of the debate had attempted to justify the Wyndham Act, and that the Wyndham Act had broken down and its finance was impossible. He made a speech which I think I am right in designating as the speech of an amateur Chancellor of the Exchequer. He said that because Colonial securities have been introduced into the Trustee Act Consols had fallen. I should like to ask the Government if they think that taking Colonial securities out of the Trustee Act would be a very popular measure? I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord St. David's, is an Imperialist or what he is, but his speech struck me as dealing rather with Imperial finance than with the Irish Land Act. We all know that the noble Lord has interests south of North America. I only wish to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0265"/>
<col>517</col>
say that there are valuable securities down there which might have affected in some way the price of gilt-edged securities in this country.<lb/>
In this Bill we have compulsion to sell and compulsion on the tenant to pay a larger annuity&#x2014;that is the State rent. I am not quite sure that there is such a universal demand in Ireland for compulsion as the Chief Secretary and the members of the Government wish to point out to us.<lb/>
I should like to read to your Lordships an extract from what a noble Lord who is, I think, now in the House has written to me with regard to his tenants. He says that two or three tenants bought during his father's lifetime, and that early this year one or two of the tenants approached the agent with the request, which was very earnest, that they should not be forced to purchase. This arose from the fact that there was no specific rent day on the estate and that the tenants could pay when they liked, always with a satisfactory result to the landlord. As long as they paid that was the great thing; whilst those who had purchased had to pay on May 1 and November 1 to the rent collector of His Majesty's Government, who refused to give them any extension of the time in which to pay, which was most inconvenient financially to the tenants owing to the fact that they had to sell their live stock at a bad time. That does not show, I think, that there is really very much wish amongst tenants to purchase. I am not talking of the West of Ireland; I am talking of parts of Ireland away from the West where compulsion would be put in force as is in this Bill.<lb/>
We all know that the Bill is brought in because of the calculations made under the Wyndham Act that guaranteed land stock could be issued at at least &#x00A3;95 for each &#x00A3;100 stock. That seemed reasonable enough, but owing to the fall in stocks the Guarantee Fund is almost exhausted, and under the 1903 Act the loss will fall upon the ratepayers. That is an acknowledged fact. We all know that this Bill is founded on the Runciman Report&#x2014;that is, the Report of a Departmental Committee of the Treasury. I ask your Lordships' House and everybody concerned in this matter, Is the Treasury really better off because compulsion has been tacked on to
<col>518</col>
the Bill? Really it looks to me as if this is what might have happened: that the Chief Secretary was faced with this serious situation that land purchase must go on&#x2014;he has admitted that; the Treasury were appproached and they said they could do it on certain terms, and they may have suggested, "If you put compulsion into the Bill you will have the Nationalist vote." That sounds very well. I am speaking for the farmers of Ireland who make their living out of the land, and I begin to think that we who live in Ireland have really been made fools of over this question, because I do not see myself why compulsion should have been tacked on. Is it for a financial reason? I have never heard that suggested. It has been tacked on in order to make it popular in certain quarters. We object to compulsion. When Clause 1, where the tenant is made to pay 5<i>s.</i> per cent. for his annuity, came up in another place, the Nationalist members and the Unionist members joined together and voted against the Government. That is a very rare combination. That was on the question of the tenants. Then the compulsion on the landowner is really of the most drastic kind. The compulsory sections are Clauses 64, 65 and 66, but the Estates Commissioners may by order delegate all or any of their powers to any one or two of their number with no appeal except on law and not on fact.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I should like to say a word with regard to what fell from Lord MacDonnell. I cannot congratulate the noble Earl who introduced this Bill on the way he has been treated by the Back Benches. One noble Earl, whom we all know very well, a very old friend of mine, attacked the Bill in no unmeasured terms. My noble friend Lord MacDonnell says he will support the landlords against compulsion although he does not quite see how the Treasury will take that. Lord Granard cited a case with regard to the zones, and then said he believed a great many cases existed. When we come to Committee I think we must hear what those cases are because I noticed that a great many of the remarks of the noble Earl&#x2014;I say it with all respect to him&#x2014;were more fitted for Committee than Second Reading. When we come to close quarters I hope we shall have those cases mentioned. As to the Estates Commissioners and the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0266"/>
<col>519</col>
power that can be exercised by a Commissioner, broadly speaking it means that one man can take land in any part of Ireland for any purpose he thinks fit. The drastic powers of compulsion to be exercised by a Commissioner against landowners reminds me of the sequestration of property in a conquered country after a war. That is exactly the case, and noble Lords cannot deny it. As has been said again and again from these benches, there has been no case made for compulsion, none whatsoever. The noble Earl read out some cases from the Report of the Congested Districts Board as showng that compulsion was necessary and that Mr. Gerald Balfour and Mr. Arthur Balfour were in favour of compulsory powers being given. I think he had his answer from Lord Atkinson with regard to those two gentlemen, and I hope that answer was perfectly satisfactory.<lb/>
The most complete speech and the most perfect speech with regard to this Bill was delivered by the Chief Secretary in 1908, when he explained its provisions. The right hon. gentleman said that if you gave compulsory powers for one-third of Ireland to the Congested Districts Board for the relief of congestion it would be impossible to withhold similar powers from the Estates Commissioners outside that area, otherwise the boundary question would arise. We know that question will constantly arise, and that is one of our objections to the Bill. The Chief Secretary went on to say that nobody knew better than Mr. Wyndham that there were many estates outside the congested districts which presented precisely the same difficulties, and to include one and exclude another would, in his judgment, cause great injustice. My Lords, we will deal with that question also in Committee. The Chief Secretary added that it was obvious that the powers would have to be exercised within close limits owing to the limitations of the resources of the Estates Commissioners. That is the only saving clause in the Chief Secretary's statement where he put forward strongly and explicitly that there was to be compulsion but under limitations. He said that those powers were as necessary in the one case as in the other to secure social order. I do not myself see where the social order will come in when one man is paying one rent on one side of the hedge and another man a different rent on the other. I know what my countrymen are. The Chief Secretary

said it was social order which alone could justify these provisions of the Act of 1903.<lb/>
I do not wish to say anything personal at all. I only speak from the political point of view with regard to the Chief Secretary. He has given way on many points, but he has not given way on this. I see no change here. Grass lands, pig styes, woods, apple orchards, shingle and rocks are all mixed up together in one huge Irish land stew to be ladled out by Mr. Commissioner so-and-so to whom he likes and how he likes. My Lords, I can see the cow-hunters and the cattle-drivers&#x2014;I know them, and we have read about them and talked about them in this House&#x2014;gathered round waiting with interest for a very large ladleful. We are threatened with direful consequences if this Bill is not passed as it is presented to this House. It has been said before that "the dogs of war are to be let loose." That is entirely too grand an expression. I would rather read it that the curs of village ruffianism should be unmuzzled to bark and bite at the heels of respectable men.<lb/>
No doubt we shall be told in Committee that there is compulsion existing in England under certain Acts. But is over &#x00A3;50,000,000 owing in England for voluntary agreements for purchase between landlord and tenant? There is no analogy at all in the case, and if any analogy is made we shall, of course, be glad to argue it to the uttermost point. I must remind your Lordships that the representatives of the tenants and the representatives of the landlords came to an agreement at the Land Conference. I am sorry my noble friend Lord Dunraven is not here. I noticed that the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, said he took all honourable part in that agreement. I perfectly agree with that. I helped him. Compulsion was not in that treaty of peace, and I ask the responsible Ministers of the Crown if they are once more going to throw the apple of discord amongst us owing to financial considerations which have nothing to do with Ireland and which are not the fault either of an individual Irishman or of Irishmen collectively.<lb/>
I should now like to say a word with regard to the zones. "Zones" is a technical word, and I quite understand noble Lords from England being immensely
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0267"/>
<col>521</col>
confused by the technical terms which have grown up with successive Land Acts in Ireland. At one time I did not understand them myself. I understand them only too well now. Dryden says "An embroidered zone surrounds her waist." The zone we talk about in an Irish Land Bill is a much more prosaic question. I feel it is like talking Greek sometimes when using these technical terms. I am sure Greek is a great deal better understood by many noble Lords than some of the terms used. Tenants and landlord enter into a market, let me call it a Zone Market, and if they come to an agreement the Government can step in, in the shape of the Estates Commissioners, and say "Very well, you have come to an agreement and we will accept your terms within certain limits." I will not mention the limits; it is not material to my argument; but they step in and say "The money will be advanced, you are within the zones, it is practical business, and we ratify the bargain." The noble Earl, Lord Granard, said that we say that is entirely swept away. It is not entirely swept away, but the Estates Commissioners come in and begin asking questions about the price. "Is the price good enough?" Under the former arrangement they did not come down and examine the holdings and delay the matter in any way, but you now give them the opportunity of doing so. If there is any question of shortness of money it is very easy to delay the matter in that way, and we all know that it has been delayed in many cases because the money is short.<lb/>
Then as to the bonus. After all, we are told that you are very generous with the bonus. I suppose the generosity is based on this, that the Runciman Report reduced it by a stroke of the pen to three per cent. The Government have given us in this Bill a sliding scale for the bonus. I do not want to go into the figures at all, but the truth of the matter is that the bonus has slid away down the scale. The bonus was very important to us. The noble Earl knows as well as I do that it was the sweetener that enabled the landlord to sell his land. Now I come to the congested districts part. I approach this subject with no feeling of rancour whatsoever. I know what congested districts are, I have been in some of the very poorest, and I have seen very great poverty indeed. That was some years ago, but you must remember that owing to the Congested Districts Board as at present constituted a great deal of that poverty has been alleviated
<col>522</col>
and those people have been helped in many ways; and I am glad to see that the money provided for the new Board amounts to exactly &#x00A3;144,750. At the present moment there is no cry of distress in Ireland, and the West of Ireland has enjoyed a very fine season. The sun has shone there while the rain has poured down in other parts of the United Kingdom, and the President of our Trish Board of Agriculture has told me with truth that there is very little potato disease&#x2014;that bane of the peasantry of the West&#x2014;there, greatly owing to the efforts of the Board of Agriculture and the Congested Districts Board.<lb/>
There is no doubt there is congestion in the West. Let me remind your Lordships that it is divided into three classes&#x2014;the maritime class, people living on the seaboard: the intermediate class, half maritime and half landsmen; and the inland class who cultivate small holdings and never go out on to the ocean at all. Before I continue with regard to this question of congestion in the West, which I approach, as I said before, with no feelings of rancour or disagreement at all, I should like to say something again with regard to the author of this measure. I do not speak in any personal way at all. I have the pleasure of the Chief Secretary's acquaintance, but when we have a measure of this importance I think it is necessary to ask oneself what are the political achievements of the man who brings it in. I ask your Lordships, and I ask everybody in Ireland, what has Mr. Birrell done to promote the prosperity and welfare of that country? Mr. Birrell succeeded Mr. Bryce. Mr. Bryce left the country to go to America to occupy a great and honourable place there. Cattle-driving had begun. It continued in Ireland under Mr. Birrell's administration to such an extent that this industry was seriously threatened. I never thought it would go on and ruin it, and I never said so. I do not think we are all such fools in Ireland as to allow it to go on, no matter what Government are in power there, because cattle and horses (which were "driven" too) in an agricultural country like ours where we have the best grass in the world for cattle rearing and feeding is our most important industry. Let us see what Mr. Birrell did. He brought in the Councils Bill. The rejection of that Bill was about the cleverest thing the Nationalist Party have ever done. I give Mr. Birrell credit for the Roman Catholic University Bill,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0268"/>
<col>523</col>
and I was very glad to see it was passed. I will not say anything more about the Chief Secretary.<lb/>
I should like to say a word with regard to the extraordinary provisions in the Bill by which nine counties are included in the congested areas. I have a table here with regard to the county of Cork showing the amount of land that could have been bought for the relief of congestion&#x2014;always supposing congestion existed there&#x2014;when it was in the open market. We can deal with that in Committee. Now I should like to quote to your Lordships something from an entirely independent Report with regard to the congested districts. You all remember the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation. Lord Balfour of Burleigh and Lord Blair Balfour, in their joint recommendations, said&#x2014;this was in 1902&#x2014;that in the congested districts there were two classes mainly, the poor and the destitute; that there were hardly any resident gentry, very few traders and officials, and that nearly all the inhabitants were either poor, or on the verge of poverty; that in those districts, the very poorest in Ireland, the taxation was by far the highest, but the local resources were so low that even with a high rate of taxation the indispensable needs of the locality could not be properly met; that there was very little spent on outdoor relief and there were very few indoor paupers because the people were very helpful to one another, and although so poor themselves largely supported their destitute. My Lords, that is very true. Let the Government make out a case where it can be shown that land adjacent to these poor holdings cannot be got without compulsion. I want to show that land can be got without compulsion.<lb/>
Let me call your Lordships' attention to what the O'Conor Don said with reference to compulsory purchase. In his evidence before the Dudley Commission he said it was a novel thing, when you could get more land than you could use without compulsion, that although A did not want to sell his land and B's was quite as good you should take A's. He agreed if owners of land would not part with it that there might be a case for compulsion, but he did not agree that that was the case. His opinion was that it had been proved pretty conclusively that it was not so, and until all the land that could be obtained voluntarily had been acquired there was no case for compulsion. I heard the O'Conor
<col>524</col>
Don's father's name quoted in the debate just now. All I can say with regard to that is, <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>. My Lords, I will not detain you longer. I will only add that, as one living a good deal in Ireland and living in peace, I do not hesitate to affirm that at this moment the Irish people suffer from no grievances, political or social, which it is in the power of any Government to allay. There is absolutely no need for this up-rooting of a system of land purchase which has for nearly forty years worked well and worked for peace&#x2014;I allude to the voluntary system. There is now in Ireland no Government oppression, no class oppression, no religious oppression, and no oppression at all unless it is an oppression not to be allowed to seize your neighbour's goods or resort to violent measures if you do not agree with his views on land tenure. My Lords, this complicated and drastic measure settles nothing, but, on the contrary, unsettles everybody in our country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01601"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not detain you many minutes as there is only one point upon which I wish to remark. It is a point that no one has touched upon yet, and that is the effect the migration of congests to the grazing lands has upon the cattle trade of the country. That is one of the most vital points, and in order that it may be understood I must explain to your Lordships that among the grazing farms in the West we have what are called judicial holdings&#x2014;small holdings under &#x00A3;20, holdings between &#x00A3;20 and &#x00A3;50, and. holdings above &#x00A3;50. The small men breed most of the young cattle, the middle men breed some, and the biggest judicial holders generally buy the cattle young from the small holders and when they become one and a-half or two years old they pass on to the grazier. It is absolutely necessary that they should go to the grazier, because the cattle cannot develop on small holdings; they want scope as they grow. If you take away the grass land occupied by the grazier all the small holders will become bankrupt; they will not be able to pay their instalments if they have bought their holdings, or their rents if they have not bought, and the result will be that although you benefit congestion in another district by the migration of the congests you will create paupers in the districts to which they go. I live in the country and farm my place myself, and I know perfectly well what the custom with regard to rearing cattle in Ireland is as I have explained to your Lordships; and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0269"/>
<col>525</col>
you ought not to break up an established custom suddenly before you see whether the proposed change is going to have a good effect.<lb/>
The result of the Act of 1903 is that lands have been divided largely, and I can assure your Lordships that the cattle trade has been affected. There are too many young cattle in the country now to supply the graziers, and young cattle are a drug in the market. You may go round the fairs and you will see a lot of half-starved underbred cattle which have been reared on poor land and which the graziers will not buy. We hear about there being a boom in the cattle trade. There is a boom in the sense of a rise in the price of old cattle in condition because they are scarce, but young cattle, as I say, are a drug in the market. I think I can prove that to your Lordships by one or two quotations. The first is an article in the <i>Roscommon Messenger</i>,a very strong Nationalist newspaper of April 3 last, when the spring cattle trade was at its height. It is dealing with one of the results of land purchase. I do not want to abuse land purchase and I do not think this paper wants to either. It says that recent fairs in the county have brought under notice one of the natural results of land purchase which may lead to very serious injury to the cattle trade in the country if necessary precautions are not taken, and that within the last six or eight months there had been an entire absence in their fairs of herds of well finished cattle owing to the system of land purchase in the country.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, the <i>Tuam Herald</i> of April 17, commenting on the same subject, says it is abundantly clear that not a moment too soon has the question been raised, and that we cannot allow universal purchase to go on without seeing whither it leads and where it ends. It goes on to say that the Irish cattle trade has been an established institution and must not all at once be subjected to a change a little short of revolution without seeing whether or not it is a change for the better. It points out that the small farmer raises young store cattle which, at the age of twelve to eighteen months, he sells to the grazier, and if the grazier who prepares the cattle for exporting is to go under, and he is being gradually stamped out by land purchase, the small owners and breeders must at once turn round and supply his place if possible. That, my Lords, has been the effect on the cattle trade in Galway and Roscommon. In August last I was going down from my place
<col>526</col>
in Galway and there was a fair being held at Gort at which the train stopped, and an inspector got into my carriage and complained that there was not a single young fat beast to be got that year and that there had been 2,000 less cattle carried from Ennis station. It may be asked why do not the people complain? My Lords, they dare not. There is no independent public opinion in Ireland to-day. I think the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, will admit that. The League forms public opinion, and if people do not follow the League they know what will happen to them&#x2014;outrage is the first thing, possibly murder in the end, and boycotting always.<lb/>
I would like to say a good word for the graziers. We are told by the Irish Nationalist members that graziers employ little or no labour. That is perfectly true, but they put more money into the pockets of the small men than if they employed labour. We will suppose a grazier has a farm of 100 acres of moderately good land, and, allowing one beast to two acres, supposing he buys a young beast for &#x00A3;7, that &#x00A3;7 goes into the pockets of the small holder, so that the grazier buys at the rate of &#x00A3;3 10<i>s</i> for his acre, all of which goes into the pocket of the small man. Is there any other farmer who spends as much as &#x00A3;3 10<i>s</i> an acre? Why is it that they are unpopular? The fact of the matter is that the grazier is a more or less independent man; he is not popular with the Leaguers and therefore is not allowed to become popular with the small tenants. Grazing farms are the only farms that produce what I might call a fair competition rent for the land, and if you place small men on the land who are not agriculturists in the ordinary sense of the word at all although they may understand spade labour and the putting of a few potatoes in, the result will be disastrous. I am in favour of relieving congestion, of course, but what is the good of bringing over to the rich grass lands of Galway small men who know nothing whatever of farming?<lb/>
Sir Horace Plunkett holds the same opinion, if I may quote from an excellent article he wrote in the June number of the <i>Nineteenth Century and After.</i> He points out the uselessness of importing these small men on to grass lands, and says they would have to be taught to be efficient labourers before they could begin to learn to be farmers. I do not agree with Sir Horace there, because I have had experience of these men as labourers and do not want
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0270"/>
<col>527</col>
any better; the only thing is they require to have a man over them to show them what to do. They have not much constructive power, but put a good man over them and you do not want any better labourer. Sir Horace goes on to speak of the immense general importance to Ireland of discrediting the agrarian idea which leads every man to cling to his own land or to covet his neighbour's, and although he agrees with the necessity for the reduction of congestion yet he says the Government should refuse to give a farm to any man who has neither the knowledge and skill nor the working capital to enable him to make a living out of it.<lb/>
I believe the real way to relieve congestion is to get employment elsewhere for the men in the congested districts. Galway, for example, is full of marble and granite, and there is a small company at work there now developing quarries. They have put &#x00A3;17,000 into it, and although it is only a small beginning they are already paying away &#x00A3;100 a week in wages. If capital could be got into the country to start that kind of thing it would relieve congestion considerably, and I would far sooner see &#x00A3;500,000 spent in developing such an industry than in giving it to landowners to induce them to sell their grass lands. When the Committee stage arrives I shall bring down some samples from the quarries of the company I have mentioned for any noble Lord to look at who cares to do so. It has been assumed that if the land is transferred from the possession of the owners to that of the tenants everything in Ireland will be settled. I think there are three very great dangers behind that assumption. One certainly is that capital will leave the country, another is that if the grass lands are divided it will certainly mean ruin to the cattle trade which is the most promising industry we have in Ireland. As soon as compulsory land purchase becomes general the loyalists will be driven out of the South and West, because that is the whole object of land purchase. It has been an agitation from start to finish to get the landlords out of their lands in the South and West because they are loyal subjects. If any noble Lord doubts that opinion I can amply justify it by quotations from the speeches of Irish Nationalist members. In every speech up to to-day they have said they want us out for that, reason.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01602"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: I will not detain your Lordships very long in bringing before you, as best I can, the reason why I wish to
<col>528</col>
support the Second Reading of this Bill. I think it is admitted that there would have to be a re-adjustment of the financial position under the Act of 1903, and that appears to me to make it necessary for us to consider the points in this Bill as they appear before us. First of all, I must say what an extreme advantage it has been to us in this House to have had this Bill discussed, a Bill containing as it does such sweeping conditions altering to a very great extent the land purchase system in Ireland. The noble Earl who brought in the Bill said the Act of 1903 was passed amid congratulations, conviviality, and the shaking of hands by everybody. May I tell your Lordships why there was that great conviviality? It was because it meant a return to that freedom of contract between man and man which is so clear to every one of us. That conditions of things is to be swept away and the arrangement underlying the whole of the 1903 Act which made it such a phenomenal success is to be set aside. We have only had dug up before us one single case of irregularity of purchase, and I believe that case if it were inquired into would be found to be not so bad as it is supposed to be.<lb/>
In bringing in the Bill the noble Earl omitted to allude to Part IV. That Part of the Bill brings the whole of Ireland under compulsion. It is put at the end of the Bill as a sort of afterthought. That appears to me to be a peculiar feature, and we cannot in all fairness apply it to particular parts; we must apply it to the whole of Ireland. I should like to ask the noble Earl who brought in the Bill whether, following the argument of the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, we shall be able to discuss and amend the financial clauses of this Bill in Committee. I do not know whether that would raise a question of privilege, but Lord MacDonnell, in his very able speech, suggested that there was a possibility that we should be able to discuss and amend the financial clauses of the Bill in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01603"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I see the noble Lord wishes an answer now, and I am unwilling to answer that question at such short notice. The noble Lord knows as well as I do what the custom is as regards the privileges of the other House&#x2014;that is to say, that to increase or diminish or vary a charge upon public funds has not hitherto been considered to fall within the province of this House, and the noble Lord will have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0271"/>
<col>529</col>
to judge how far any Amendment he may desire to put down on this part of the Bill is in conflict with that long-established rule.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01604"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: Quite so. It may be a case of privilege, but it appears to me that this Bill has come before your Lordships' House in a very curious way. The financial clauses of the Bill were not discussed at all in the other House, and I do not know whether that fact would be any justification for altering them in this House. It appears to me to be a very odd position of affairs that a Bill of this kind dealing with such large financial matters should be brought up to your Lordships' House and we should not be in a position to in any way touch it or amend it. As regards the financial proposals, it appears to me to be a perfect farce that they should never have been discussed in the House of Commons, and yet the Bill has been brought up and placed on the Table of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01605"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I understand that one day was given by the other House to the discussion of the financial Resolution associated with the Bill, and a second day to the Report of the financial Resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01606"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: Then I have been misinformed, but One day appears to me to be a very short space of time in which to deal with the financial provisions of a Bill of this description. Perhaps the noble Earl will be able to tell me whether he may put our Amendments on the paper. Whether they will be considered or not is another question. The noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, gave us a concrete case just now showing that a considerable loss would fall on the landlord if the Bill passed in its present form, and that it might mean a loss in selling the land of two years purchase on the rent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01607"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: In the case I gave the House the loss amounted to one and a-half year's purchase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01608"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: There is one clause which the noble Earl who brought in the Bill appeared to treat with great affection&#x2014;Clause 17. I myself entertain the greatest misgivings with regard to the whole of that clause, because it means the incorporation into the Bill of that very dangerous element which has sprung up in Ireland of the landless men. Landless men do not exist
<col>530</col>
only in Ireland; they are a by-product that you get in any country in the world. If law and order are not guarded landless men will spring up anywhere and make themselves a trouble, and I maintain that it is quite unjustifiable to say that landless men are the outcome of the Act of 1903. They are a by-product created by the Government through not taking care to look after the law and the property of the people in Ireland.<lb/>
The history of the Congested Districts Board is one of the nicest things in Irish history. It emanated first of all when Mr. Arthur Balfour was Chief Secretary for Ireland. But now you have been putting men who are not agricultural men on these lands, and you have been running great risks. An Irishman is a man who will take any land you put him on and see what he can do with it. I cannot help thinking that there has been too much hurry in dealing with congestion in the West of Ireland. But is the system of buying, dividing, and altering the size of holdings and putting men here and there going to obtain as a permanent institution in Ireland? The procedure to get untenanted land which has never come into the Courts is very peculiar, and the question of buying these untenanted lands is a very delicate one; for where negotiations have been entered into and failed it means that the property is depreciated in value. One word more about the compulsory clauses. The noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, said last night that compulsion meant cash payment, and that cash payment would mean another block, and a block which would be very hard to get over, in the Land Commission Courts. There is a block now of &#x00A3;52,000,000. According to the noble Earl's figures there are &#x00A3;75,000,000 required to complete sales.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01609"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I ought to explain about the &#x00A3;75,000,000. I took that as a sort of half-way house between the two extreme figures which have been named.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01610"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: Assuming it to be &#x00A3;70,000,000, supposing you brought in compulsory purchase to-morrow you would have a block at once and a worse block than you have now. You cannot have the two things running side by side. You must have the one or the other. If you have compulsory purchase you must inevitably have cash payment, and you will have a worse block than you have now. We on this side of the House only ask that you will
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0272"/>
<col>531</col>
allow the voluntary system, which has been such a phenomenal success, to continue as it is now. I dare say the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack when he addresses your Lordships' House will give us a case to prove that compulsion is necessary. We maintain, on the other hand, that land suitable for dealing with congestion can be obtained voluntarily if the owners are paid in cash and if they are properly approached. It is very curious, if the voluntary purchase system has been such a phenomenal success, that you should immediately knock it on the head and start another one. I am afraid, my Lords, I have gone over a lot of old ground, but with a Bill of this description and with the voluminous speeches we have had in the course of the debate it is almost impossible to avoid going back over some old ground. But I do trust, if we are to read this Bill a second time, that we shall be able to make it a Bill which will not inflict injustice on the owners and occupiers in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01612"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that if there are any who have doubts as to the advisability or the necessity of a Second Chamber those doubts must disappear when it is realised in what condition this Bill, a Bill of great importance and magnitude, has been sent to your Lordships' House. I may say it has been practically undiscussed in another place&#x2014;certainly its chief clauses have been undiscussed, because they were guillotined by means of a powerful majority; and therefore I say it is necessary in those circumstances that your Lordships' possessing here fortunately no guillotine and no question of that guillotine, should discuss each of these clauses when we go into Committee in the manner in which I think they ought to have been discussed in another place.<lb/>
In the course of his speech last night my noble friend Lord Dunraven drew your Lordships' attention to the very short time that was permitted in the House of Commons for the discussion of this question. I do not think I need weary your Lordships by again going over the details he gave as to the amount of time given to this very important measure, but I heard with some surprise statements from the two noble Earls on the Front Bench opposite which seem to show that they think adequate
<col>532</col>
time and adequate discussion have been given to this measure in another place. In the course of his speech Lord Langford, who spoke last, made a statement in which he declared that no proper time had been given to discuss the financial clauses of this Bill. The noble Earl opposite, I have no doubt speaking as he believed absolutely correctly, declared that a certain amount of time had been given to the discussion of these financial clauses. Since your Lordships' House adjourned this evening I have looked into this question, and I find my friend Lord Langford was absolutely right. I find that one day was given to the financial Resolution in Committee, but that it was gagged without discussion in accordance with the rules of the guillotine as carried out by His Majesty's Government in another place; and I find that one day only was given on Report. The Report of the Resolution was taken on July 23, one day being allocated under the gag resolution to the Committee stage of the clauses, which occupied certainly not more than half an hour or so. Therefore, I think my noble friend, Lord Langford was perfectly justified in saving that the financial clauses of this Bill had been run through the House of Commons with hardly any, if any, adequate discussion.<lb/>
I must remind your Lordships again, because it seems to be forgotten on the Front Bench opposite, that although this Bill contains no fewer than seventy clauses only ten of them were discussed at all in another place. To the Second Reading only two short days were given; for the Committee stage eight days, of which four were Fridays and therefore short days; for the Report stage, two days were given, the only clauses discussed being Government clauses; and for the Third Reading, only half a-day was given. I would ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack whether in his experience of the House of Commons he has ever known a Bill of this magnitude rushed through by means of a powerful majority with such unseemly haste, which I think, is absolutely injurious to the interests of Parliament as a whole. I confess I heard with a certain amount of surprise from the noble Earl Lord Granard, that he considered the Bill had been sufficiently discussed in the House of Commons. It is not for me to confute the noble Earl, who is not here, but I refer him to his colleague Mr. Birrell, and to two of his Nationalist supporters, Mr. Redmond and Mr. Kavanagh
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0273"/>
<col>533</col>
What said Mr. Birrell with regard to this measure? Mr. Birrell said&#x2014;
<quote>"I agree there are some parts of this measure which have not received proper, or indeed, any Parliamentary discussion."</quote>
I think out of the mouth of the Chief Secretary I can prove that this Bill has not been fairly discussed, and I would ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack if he can give some reason why, on the confession of his own colleagues, this Bill has not been properly discussed in another place, and is sent up here where it is expected, I suppose, to be accepted literally without discussion. Mr. Redmond said that if there were no great Budget called for in this session the whole of the session could be most properly occupied with the discussion of this Bill. Mr. Kavanagh, also a supporter of the Chief Secretary, virtually said the same thing; and therefore I do ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack if he will give us some reason, when he replies to me, why a measure of this importance is sent up to your Lordships' House from another place without discussion. My Lords, I have my own ideas. I cannot but think it is the desire of His Majesty's Government to conceal from the country the shortcomings of this measure; but I hope your Lordships when we arrive at the Committee stage will not allow anything of that sort, and that you will discuss fully and freely every one of the clauses so that the country may understand what is the nature of this Bill.<lb/>
I say at once that if this had been a measure to promote the transfer of land in Ireland by means of purchase it would receive the most cordial support of the Party to which I belong, not only in this House but also in another place. I have myself from the moment that I commenced my political career as an Irish member of the House of Commons done my utmost, as far as lay in my power, to promote the transfer of land from owner to occupier in Ireland on terms agreeable to occupier and owner and with no appreciable risk to the State; and I look back with satisfaction to the various measures that I have been privileged to support. I look back to the measure of my noble friend Lord Ashbourne in 1885 which did so much to solve the great Irish land problem; and of all the measures of land purchase which have been put forward by the Party of which I have been a member I can say with perfect truth that I
<col>534</col>
have done my utmost, as far as lay in my power, to promote those measures. But, my Lords, the Bill before us is not merely a Land Purchase Bill. It was not initiated in another place and sent up to your Lordships with the idea of transferring the land from the owner to the occupier on the terms I have put forward. This is a Bill which has been truly described in another place as calculated to paralyse the whole system of land sale and land purchase in Ireland. There are many other objects aimed at in this Bill far beyond the principles we have always supported. There is undoubtedly what is called compulsory sale. Upon that I shall say a few words before I sit down; but in this Bill, which we were led to believe was a Bill to promote the sale and purchase of land in Ireland, we find involved an enormous number of provisions of an absolutely extraneous character. We find there is the reconstruction of the Congested Districts' Board. We find also many provisions in this Bill which, if the question is fairly considered and thrashed out in your Lordships' House, must prove to be absolutely injurious to the question of land purchase and land sale in Ireland.<lb/>
A great deal lies been said about the Act of 1903. I am proud to think that as a member of the Government of that time I had a good deal to do with that Bill in sup porting the proposals of my right hon. friend who was then Chief Secretary for Ireland, Mr. George Wyndham. But remember what was the basis on which that Act was founded. There was a general agreement on both sides of the House of Commons, and also on both sides of your Lordships' House. It received the sanction and the support of the Nationalist Party in Ireland, and consequently I may say that it was a universally satisfactory Bill. But what is the Bill now before us? I cannot gather much from what took place in the House of Commons, because no discussion of the question was allowed there; but even from what I have heard in your Lordships' House in the course of the last two days I cannot but gather that this Bill is not universally approved of by all the sections of those parties who support His Majesty's Government either in this House or in the House of Commons. The finance question, of course, is a very serious one. If His Majesty's Government had introduced a measure which would have lubricated the wheels of finance, by which, I mean, introduced some measure which
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0274"/>
<col>535</col>
would have remedied some of the imperfections with regard to finance in the Act of 1903&#x2014;for I do not think there ever has been a Bill introduced into Parliament of any sort or kind without imperfections&#x2014;that measure would have received the hearty support of the members of the Opposition, whether in this House or in the House of Commons. But this Bill does nothing of the sort.<lb/>
I am not going to enter into the question of finance. It has been dealt with by Lord MacDonnell, and I have no doubt that in Committee it will be dealt with equally fully. Therefore, I do not propose now to enter into details; but what I do complain of is that the only solution, so far as I can gather at the present moment, to obviate the financial difficulties that have accrued is that the tenant who has bought should pay a higher annual sum to the State and that the owner who has sold should not receive his money in cash. As has been shown in the course of the debate, these two proposals must act most injuriously towards the whole question of transferring the land from the owner to the occupier, on which, I think, the future land question of Ireland depends. Not only will it do that, my Lords, but I think these proposals will injuriously affect the present arrangements that have been made.<lb/>
Having said so much, or rather so little, about the financial question, because I think that is really a question for Committee, I pass to what I think are the chief clauses in the Bill which will most injuriously affect the question of the transfer of land in Ireland. I deal first of all with the zones. Now that question has been discussed from various points of view, but I have not gathered from anything that has been said that anybody can controvert the statement that the zone system initiated by Mr. Wyndham has been most beneficial in the transfer of land from owner to occupier. The only fault, perhaps, that can be found with regard to the zone system is that it has worked too satisfactorily, for it has what is vulgarly called "taken on," and a vast amount of land, far more than ever was anticipated, has been transferred from owner to occupier. The rapidity and the ease with which those transactions have been carried out have been due entirely to the admirable system of the zones as intro-
<col>536</col>
duced by Mr. Wyndham in his Bill of 1903. I do not think the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will contradict me when I say that the transfer of land has been extremely rapid and extremely satisfactory, and that the only drawback has been that there has not been money enough to meet the requirements from the action of these zones.<lb/>
What is the only objection put forward to the admirable working of the zone system? Undoubtedly the Nationalist Party did not approve of the progress made under the zone system in the transfer of land in Ireland. Undoubtedly that transfer, making the occupier the owner of his holding, is very injurious to those whose sole object in life is agitation in Ireland. Consequently, if the zone system, which has worked so satisfactorily, and would continue to do so if left alone, is allowed to remain, they recognise that agitation must be abolished. Therefore, they put forward a number of arguments as to why the zones have not worked satisfactorily. One of their arguments is that the prices of land are too high. If that is true the zone system must be unpopular. But is the zone system unpopular, either with the occupier who desires to buy or with the owner? If it were so the intending purchaser would naturally and wisely refuse to buy directly under the zone system and would insist on buying through the Estates Commissioners. Well, have they bought through the Estates Commissioners to a greater extent than they have through the direct system of sales, as they are enabled to do under the zones? I think the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will find that nine-tenths of the total applications to buy land have been under the direct sale of the zones, and not at the hands of the Estate Commissioners. Therefore, the statement that the zones are not popular is contradicted by the figure I have quoted.<lb/>
Then we know, again, that the Nationalist Party, which are synonymous with the United Irish League, are extremely anxious to abolish the zone system, and the leaders of the Nationalist Party or the United Irish League Party held a meeting of their various constituents in September last year in which they denounced the whole of the zone system. But they have been repudiated by the men whom they advised not to take advantage
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0275"/>
<col>537</col>
of the zone system, for in the two months following September last year; in which this appeal was made, applications for money to be advanced on direct sales amounted to nearly &#x00A3;13,500,000. I venture to say&#x2014;and I hope the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will take note of my assertion&#x2014;that the zone system is not only not unpopular but has worked with the greatest advantage in Ireland for those who desire to buy land. Then we have been told by the Nationalist Party that under the zones the occupiers of land who are anxious to buy have made improvident bargains. I have myself a higher estimation of the sense, the shrewdness, and the ability of the occupiers of land in Ireland than evidently the Nationalist Party have, and having had a certain amount of experience&#x2014;I have sold all my property in County Down&#x2014;I do not hesitate to say that the occupier of land is quite as capable of taking care of himself as the man whose land he wants to buy. If the occupier had been improvident and had given more than he could afford to pay, would not the result have been apparent in the fact that he would not have paid the annuities which were due? Is not that a proof that the tenant has not only got what he wanted, and that he has not lost, but has in all probability gained by the bargain? The noble Lord, Lord St. David's, made a long speech yesterday, but as I am not a financier I could not follow him with regard to all the points he put forward; but on one point I could follow him and controvert him. Lord St. David's seemed somewhat doubtful as to the security on which money was advanced to the occupier in order to enable him to buy his holding. Well, my Lords, I say at once that when the State advances money it is bound to recognise its responsibility and be perfectly assured that the annuities to be paid for the advance should be paid regularly and without any doubt or any fear that the State will not receive its just return.<lb/>
But now let me go back to the various Purchase Acts with which I was connected. I should like to hear from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack whether he is aware of the regularity with which these annuities have been paid. From the very commencement the annuities have been paid regularly by these Irish tenants, and in a manner which has
<col>538</col>
not been equalled, Certainly not surpassed, by the London tenants of those Dukes who are so often held up to reprobation. If the noble and learned Lord cares to look through the figures he will find that the arrears are not even in thousands, but are only in hundreds; and therefore when Lord St. David's tells us there is no security I ask him to prove it, seeing that I can show that the interest on the money has been paid with a regularity of which anybody in any part of the United Kingdom might be absolutely proud.<lb/>
Again, my Lords, we are told that the prices given under the zones do not represent the full security. The man who says that, to my mind, is absolutely ignorant of the details of the question as to how Irish laud passes from the occupier to the owner. The money advanced under the zones is only the owner's interest. But what remains? There remains the security to the State of the farm itself, and there remains above all what is known in the North of Ireland as tenant right, which your Lordships in England would understand as goodwill, and the goodwill of the farm generally surpasses by a very great extent the fee simple of the value of the land. Therefore I venture to hope that I have proved Lord St. David's statement to be absolutely inaccurate, and it would never have been made had he really studied the question of the transfer of land in Ireland, the regularity with which the payments were made, and the security of the State in obtaining its just return for its outlay.<lb/>
Now what I want to know is this&#x2014;What is the attitude of the Government with regard to zones? The Government seem to me to take up a very curious attitude. On the one hand they denounce the zones, as I gather by their Bill and speeches, while, on the other hand, they seem inclined to allow the zones to go on. They do not wish, so far as I can see, entirely to abolish them, but they give powers to certain commissioners to interfere and endeavour to make a bargain&#x2014;a system which has never before been known amongst those who have accorded the Land Act of 1903 the right to come between the zones. What is the reason of this change in the zones? I have proved, I think, that the zone system is not unpopular, that it is advantageous to the owners and occupiers of land in Ireland, and that the amounts which have been
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0276"/>
<col>539</col>
advanced have been at no risk whatever to the State. Therefore I am at a loss to understand on what grounds the Government propose to alter this zone system which has worked so well. I know exactly the excuse that is put forward. It is that unreasonable sums have been advanced in order that in the sum advanced the payment of arrears might be included. It was mentioned by one or two of my noble friends behind me. But I ask His Majesty's Government to give me some specific cases in which this has taken place. From what I have heard, the cases are few and far between. Lord Granard gave one; but can he tell me of a number of cases of a similar character? I have not heard of them. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will tell me. If this state of things has taken place which we are told is the reason for abolishing the zones, then let the Government first of all give us those cases, and if they are proved to be correct then let them do one of two things&#x2014;either move an Amendment to their own Bill in your Lordships' House insisting that an inquiry shall be made as to the arrears over a certain number of years, or else let them, as my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition suggested yesterday, put down two years of arrears which should be allowed within the sphere of the zones. I think that is a fair offer to the Government. But I do ask before anything is done and the zones condemned that we should be given some specific cases as to how the system of zones has been abused. Having realised the extraordinary rapidity with which sales have been managed and the extraordinary absence of friction with which these sales have been carried on under the zones, I say that it is not right that this system should be interfered with, as it would retard, and retard most materially, the good work done under the zones by the Act of 1903.<lb/>
As to the question of the bonus, there seems to me a great deal of misapprehension as to the reason why the bonus was given in the Act of 1903. I do not think noble Lords have any idea of the expense that is required to effect a transfer of land between the owner and the occupier, and it was because the expense was so great in regard to the proof of title and many other things in the transfer of land, that that bonus was given, and more especially in order to meet the very high rate of interest
<col>540</col>
paid on charges on property in Ireland, for without that bonus being given it would have been absolutely impossible for the owner of property to sell. That was the reason why, a ter a considerable discussion in the House of Commons, it was decided that the bonus should be a fixed bonus and not a sliding one, and it is on those grounds, without going further into the matter, that I think your Lordships should very carefully consider the question before you decide to alter the system from a fixed to a sliding scale.<lb/>
But now, my Lords, the most important question in the whole of this Bill is what I may call the compulsory sale, so frequently called compulsory purchase, although I do not know why, because no one is compelled to buy, but people are compelled to sell. Your Lordships, however, will understand what I mean by it. That principle was never under discussion in Committee of the House of Commons. I should like to ask the Lord Chancellor why that was the case, because I think the most important feature of this measure is the change from the voluntary system in the Act of 1903 to the proposed compulsory system under the Bill now being discussed. I should like to hear why it was never discussed. But I would say that, in discussing the whole question of taking land compulsorily, there must be two objects prominently before the mind of any just man. First of all, is it necessary to take the land compulsorily; secondly, if you are convinced that it is necessary, are you doing it in a just mannner? Let me deal first with the question as to whether it is necessary to take this land compulsorily. I think the only excuse that can be put forward for taking land under this Bill compulsorily would be by proving that it was absolutely impossible to get land otherwise. But is that the case, my Lords? I maintain that at the present moment that state of affairs does not exist. My noble friend the Leader of the Opposition dealt very fully with this question yesterday. He will correct me if I am wrong, for I am speaking from memory, but so far as I could gather from his speech he seemed to think there was property in the congested districts of not less than 12,000 acres which was inspected by people competent to inspect&#x2014;the Congested Districts Board&#x2014;and which it was agreed would be absolutely suitable if it could be bought. Why was it not bought?
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0277"/>
<col>541</col>
Because there was no money to buy it. Surely, my Lords, you cannot say that you ought to take land compulsorily when there is much to be sold voluntarily. At the present moment there is land of the aggregate value of &#x00A3;53,000,000&#x2014;I think the noble Earl opposite gave this figure although my figure is &#x00A3;56,000,000, but that is a detail&#x2014;which it had been agreed to sell under Mr. Wyndam's Act, but for the purchase of which money is not available.<lb/>
I ventured, I hoped not rudely, to interrupt the noble Earl, Lord Granard, when he was talking about taking land compulsorily. What I want to ask is this&#x2014;Are the Government proposing to take land compulsorily and to pay for it when they have no got the money to pay for the land in respect of the agreements which have been made and which were made voluntarily? If that is the case, I am very anxious to know where the money is to come from. If His Majesty's Government do not carry out the contracts agreed upon up to those fifty odd million pounds they have no right to take money to invest in fresh lands which they propose to take compulsorily; they have no right to do that until they have paid their rightful debts. We understand and believe that it is proposed to reduce the amount of money which is due to those who have voluntarily agreed to buy and sell by taking some of it to acquire land compulsorily. I cannot believe that anybody with a sense of justice can take money which has been agreed upon, and invest it in taking land compulsorily which has not been agreed upon. Before embarking upon any system of expropriation, any system of taking land compulsorily, the amount of money that has been agreed upon should first of all be paid off, and therefore I hope that your Lordships will not agree to allow any question of taking land compulsorily and paying for it with the money which has already been agreed upon, and more or less promised&#x2014;I hope your Lordships will not allow that to be done under this Bill. I think I have proved that it is not necessary to take land compulsorily.<lb/>
I now proceed with the other part of my argument. Is it just to take this land? Let me examine the provisions of this Bill in which it is proposed to take land compulsorily. The proposals are of a most
<col>542</col>
remarkable character. The first step in taking this land is the "final offer," and the final offer is to be the first step. There is to be no bargaining. The noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, laughs, but it is no laughing matter for those whose land is about to be taken. The Bill says that the final offer is to be the price which the Estates Commissioners are willing to give, and in arriving at that price, the Estates Commissioners are to have regard to the price which the tenants and other persons&#x2014;I draw attention to that&#x2014;are willing to give. Therefore it would seem that a wholly ridiculous and inadequate offer on the part of any tenant, perhaps some unknown tenant, may be made, and if refused by the owner, as it would be refused, that starts the procedure which begins the "final offer." Therefore I am justified in saying that the first step is the final offer and the final offer is the first step. A noble Lord opposite rather criticised a remark by a noble Lord on this side of the House with regard to the question as to whom "any person" may be. I think that in the Committee stage of this Bill we should have Clauses 17 and 43 clearly defined as to what "any person" may mean. It might be the man on the spot or it might be somebody walking about the streets of London, and anything more dangerous it would be absolutely impossible to imagine. What is to be the effect in Ireland if this provision is taken advantage of? The result will be that the owners of property will be forced to take the lowest possible price, a price far below the market value. Then what will be the result of that? Those who have purchased already, those who have agreed on their purchase deeds, would naturally think that they had paid far too much, and it is quite possible that those who have agreed to buy their lands for their sons might repudiate those agreements. They might do even more. There might be the feeling that a man had paid too much, and he might refuse to pay his annuity.<lb/>
I was very much struck last night by a remark by the noble Lord, Lord Castle-town, who knows the state of Ireland a great deal better than I do. The noble Lord stated the belief that since this idea has been in the air there has also been in his district an idea to repudiate not only agreements, but to repudiate annuities. He went further and said he believed that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0278"/>
<col>543</col>
if there were a general repudiation of these annuities the result would be a civil war in Ireland. I would commend to the Government that carefully thought-out statement and ask them, in the face of that, whether they are justified in going on in the course that is being pursued. There is one question I want to ask, a really important question. Does the Chief Secretary really mean to carry out the proposals he has put forward with regard to compulsory sale? Mr. Birrell, replying to objections brought against the clause, declared that they were not likely to be realised because he said that for many a long day to come the cash at the disposal of the Estates Commissioners would be so small as to render it most unlikely that they would be put into operation. The Chief Secretary was referring to these compulsory powers. I want to know what that means. I think we are entitled to have an answer on that subject. Obviously, if the clause is to be worked it is unjust. On the other hand if it is only meant for show, if it is only meant to hoodwink the Irish Nationalists into believing they have the substance when they only have the shadow, I think your Lordships will be justified in putting an end to that state of affairs by removing the clause altogether.<lb/>
Now I come to Part III, the part which deals with congestion. The question of congestion occupied a most extensive inquiry at the hands of the Dudley Commission and should have received by the House of Commons considerably more attention than it did Mr. Birrell, in introducing the Land Bill in 1908, said the Commission attracted an enormous amount of attention and excited great interest in Ireland, and that if the House of Commons imagined that they could refer a question of such vital importance and deep interest to a Commission of this sort and then pay no attention to that Commission's Report, they would be repeating the evil behaviour for which, unfortunately, there was some precedent in the past. What has the House of Commons done with regard to the Report of the Dudley Commission? The whole <i>personnel</i> of the Congested Districts Board is thrown into the melting pot. The House of Commons was only allowed a few hours at the fag end of the session to discuss a question which took the Royal Commission two years to investigate, by means of 116 public
<col>544</col>
sittings devoted to the examination of 560 witnesses through over 60,000 questions. Their work is recorded in eleven volumes of evidence, besides nearly twenty-one pages of supplementary matter. Surely it must therefore have been a joke on the part of the Chief Secretary&#x2014;one of the somewhat remarkable jokes he makes&#x2014;when he allowed the Report to be considered in such a short space of time. Therefore I do hope that when this question comes up in your Lordships' House it will be thoroughly discussed and thrashed out from every point of view. There are very important alterations made&#x2014;alterations to increase the number of members of the Board, to increase the elective element, to enlarge the Board's area, and to confer upon the Board compulsory powers of purchase. For what purpose was that body originally created? It was created to endeavour to allay the distress and misery existing in certain congested districts. That Board did its work right well, and the changed condition of affairs in those districts is shown by the money invested in the savings banks and the increase in the thrift and industry of the people.<lb/>
But what is proposed to be done now? It is proposed to alter the whole constitution of the Board. It is proposed to add to it a number of elected members. What does that mean? To the ordinary man in England it sounds very plausible, but we who live in Ireland know full well that local pressure will be put upon those elected members to do what they can for their own districts, and so carry out a system of jobbery simply in the interests of the districts with which they are associated. If they did not do so jealousy would be created and the lives of those people would be a misery. And their business must be neglected. How can a great body of nineteen people, some of them elected, some of them not, carry out the work which a practical body has been doing for the last few years? They will resolve themselves more or less into a body of discussion and debate, and a body such as the Congested Districts Board, which has the distribution of public finance, should be above anything of that sort. They ought to be above local pressure and able to deal with these great matters with absolute impartiality. But what would be the result of this? We know full well that these elected members would be the nominees of the United Irish League, and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0279"/>
<col>545</col>
that the United Irish League has never hesitated to bring pressure of a most unpleasant character to bear upon people who, to them, are obnoxious. I have had cases brought before my notice, in which a great number of labourers' cottages have at times been put down on certain spots, not because they were wanted there, but because it was thought they would annoy the man who was the owner of the land. That is not an unusual occurrence. If that is the case with regard to labourers' cottages, what will be the condition of affairs if they have still further and greater powers entrusted to them?<lb/>
The main object of the Government in this Bill is, I understand, to migrate from the congested districts to other districts those people who are what are called migrants. What reception would those people have at the hands of the members of the United Irish League if they were planted on to land which those who were cattle-drivers thought was to be their reward for the action they had taken part in during the past two years? Do you think that migration would be encouraged under this new elected Board? We know well the opinion of those in authority in the United Irish League with regard to the landless men. There is plenty of evidence as to the opposition which the landless man feels towards the migrants. Reference is made to it in the Report of the Evidence of the Dudley Commission, numerous resolutions have been passed by branches of the League against migrants, and county councillors and other leading local members of the League have advocated the claims of the landless men as against the claims of the migrants. Under this Bill what is going to be done? You are going to let loose the cattle-drivers on the migrants. That will be the result of your proposals with regard to this alteration of the Congested Districts Board, and the whole bottom of your Bill is knocked out if these migrants whom, under your Bill, you propose to transplant into these districts, are not allowed to live there because the cattle-drivers object to them.<lb/>
Why is this Bill introduced? I do not think any one will say it is introduced for the purpose of promoting prosperity in Ireland. Can any one say that it is introduced for the purpose of promoting the transfer of land between the occupier
<col>546</col>
and the owner which is now working so admirably? Can anybody say that under this Bill you are going to relieve congestion by putting migrants down in a district where they will not be allowed to live? I do not think any one will contradict me when I say the clauses of this Bill will not carry out those objects. They will ruin some of the chief resources of Ireland. Lord Clonbrock told us yesterday that in Connaught horse-breeding was a great advantage in supplying remounts for the Army. The noble Lord did not tell your I Lordships of the enormous amount of cattle reared on these grazing ranches, or the amount of cattle exported annually on which the agricultural classes chiefly depend. The amount of stock reared on these ranches in Ireland can be calculated by millions, and if you break up these ranches, if you try to make them into mere agricultural holdings on which to put migrants who have had no experience of farming or who will be driven off by the cattle-drivers, you will bring to a deadlock one of Ireland's greatest industries.<lb/>
Why, then, is the Bill introduced? It is introduced simply as a <i>quid pro quo</i> to Mr. Dillon and the Nationalist Party for supporting the Liberal Party at the present moment in the House of Commons. It is the reward given to the members of the United Irish League for having decided that while this Bill was in progress there should be a cessation of cattle-driving. "Give Mr. Birrell a chance" was their cry. But does Mr. Birrell himself believe in the Bill he is introducing? I venture to say he introduced this Bill simply because he was told to do so, and he did so with the greatest possible reluctance. Here are Mr. Birrell's own words&#x2014;
<quote>"No one would accuse any Chief Secretary of wishing to introduce a Land Bill if he could possibly avoid it. I have done the utmost I possibly could do to avoid introducing the measure."</quote>
Those are the words of the Chief Secretary in introducing one of the most important measures ever introduced into Parliament. This Bill is not introduced to benefit Ireland. To my mind, if carried in its present condition it will mean the ruin of Ireland. It is because I feel so strongly on this subject, it is because I feel, living in Ireland as I do, how much Ireland depends on being governed by a firm system, endeavouring to promote prosperity by transferring the land on equitable terms

from landlords to tenants, that I beg your Lordships, when this Bill goes into Committee, to consider it most seriously in each and all of its details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01613"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think everybody will admit that the whole subject of Irish land and its tenure is one of the most complicated legal, social, and political problems that can be presented for the consideration of any man, and I am under this disadvantage in comparison with the noble Marquess who has just spoken, that I have not his intimate personal knowledge of the working of this subject. I have knowledge merely as a Parliamentary student during a long period of years, and my knowledge is secondhand. An additional difficulty is placed in my way by the manner in which this debate has been carried on. All through the debates that I have heard in reference to this subject there has been a constant series of accusations against the Government of the day, varying hardly at all either in phrase or in substance, and going on now, in my own experience, over a period of twenty-nine years. In each one of those debates the same kind of accusation has been made in the same kind of language as was used yesterday and as has been used to day.<lb/>
Let me see, for example, how the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, dealt with the matter. The noble Lord, if I may respectfully say so, did not contribute a single suggestion towards the solution of these difficult questions. He said that the Government were under the heel of the Irish Party; that the Irish Nationalist Party wished to prevent a settlement; that we have re-opened the whole of the question of land purchase; that we have destroyed all the elements of the Act of 1903; that the Government of this country are setting up an enormous system of intimidation; that we had a passion to destroy and a deadly partiality for a clean slate. We have also been told that the loyalists are to be driven out of the country, and that the Government wish to conceal from the country the real meaning of this Bill. Of course this is Parliamentary discussion, and I suppose Parliamentary invective differs from personal and private invective because of a certain usage; but there is no foundation for any one of those charges, and I will endeavour to establish
<col>548</col>
that with regard to particular charges made on this occasion, and others which have been made upon every occasion during the whole of the agrarian revolution that has been proceeding for more than thirty years in Ireland. I will myself endeavour to refrain from rhetoric. I am a great admirer of Lord Curzon's eloquence, but I cannot help thinking that if he could deal with these questions with a little less eloquence and a little more in a matter-of-fact way we should be more likely to come to some conclusion. I will endeavour to be matter-of-fact, and, as far as I can, to be accurate.<lb/>
In the first place, let me ask what is the occasion of this Bill? The Chief Secretary for Ireland expresses a great reluctance to bring in any Irish Land Bill. I can completely understand his feelings. I think there are very few Members of this House who do not sympathise with him. But let me see what were the circumstances and necessities attending the introduction of this Bill. The primary necessity was a necessity of finance. I do not make any reproach at all to Mr. Wyndham nor to his colleagues in the Government of 1903. But we must all acknowledge that they based their proposals upon serious miscalculations. In the first place Mr. Wyndham said that the size of the problem, the value of the land which was to be purchased under this scheme, was one hundred millions sterling. Now that was obviously wrong. There have been contracts already amounting to &#x00A3;85,000,000 sterling, and if his calculation had been right we should have been within &#x00A3;15,000,000 of completing the whole of the transactions. We know from the figures that there is from seventy-five millions to ninety-eight millions of property still to be disposed of. We know that the size of the problem was understated by one-half. In the next place, the Government of that day acted upon the assumption that two and three-quarters stock would be issued at par. As a matter of fact, the stock which has been issued during the last five or six years has been issued at eighty-eight and a fraction, and it is now still lower, and if we continued on the footing on which the Act of 1903 was introduced there would be a complete departure from the absolute limit of the demands upon the Treasury which was promised at that time in Parliament by the Government of the day, and on the faith of which Parliament passed the Act
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0281"/>
<col>549</col>
of 1903. An immense block has arisen in consequence.<lb/>
The complaint is made, "Why do you not increase the staff?" and the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, said "What you are proceeding to do is asking the State to make a composition with its creditors." But Mr. Wyndham's pledges did not relate merely to the amount of stock that would be required or to the rate at which it would be issued, but also to the rate at which the purchase would proceed. My noble friend the Leader of the House referred to that in his opening speech, but no reference whatever has been made to it in the subsequent debate. Let me remind your Lordships of what was said by Mr. Wyndham in 1903. He said there was to be "due and zealous regard in this respect to the national credit." Surely we must all share in an opinion of that kind. He then proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"I say emphatically that it will be neither financially prudent nor administratively possible to expand these operations at a pace so high as to make us go to the City for more than &#x00A3;5,000,000 in any one of the first three years after the passing of this Act."</quote>
But during the first three years after the passing of the Act upwards of &#x00A3;5,000,000 was issued every year. He proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"After three years, in my opinion, it will be possible and desirable to mend the pace. After three years we ought to be able so to mend the pace as far as we are concerned as to enable all saleable land to be sold in the course of some fifteen years."</quote>
In other words, it would be at the rate of &#x00A3;7,000,000 a year. In the fourth year upwards of &#x00A3;5,000,000 was issued, and in the fifth year upwards of &#x00A3;6,500,000 was issued, and I must say it seems to me very difficult to blame the Treasury in that particular, remembering the promises that were made and the conditions upon which the landlords themselves and the tenants knew it was intended to operate when the Bill was passed. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition admits that the time has come to reconsider the financial arrangements. Any one who has not only a jealous regard but who has a reasonable regard for the national finances of the country and the national credit, which is valuable for Ireland as well as this country, must feel that the noble Marquess is fully justified in making that statement. But it is easy to say there should be re-
<col>550</col>
consideration. It would have been most interesting from one of the distinguished authors of the Bill of 1903 to have received some assistance towards getting out of the deadlock created by that legislation. We were assenting parties to the legislation of 1903, I entirely agree, but being in Opposition and without official knowledge we could not be expected to be acquainted with all the financial foundations.<lb/>
Our solution of the deadlock is this. There are four parties who are concerned in these transactions. There is the landlord, the tenant, the Treasury, and the ratepayer. Nobody proposes that we should proceed on the lines of the Act of 1903 without some change, and for this reason, that it would leave upon the ratepayers a charge of about &#x00A3;640,000 a year. That is what will be the effect unless some Bill is passed to mend the situation. We do not propose that the ratepayer should bear that sum of money, and the Treasury is ready to come to his relief. I must confess that the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, made a remarkable statement when he was dealing with the liability to fall upon the fund in relief of rates. It was solemnly laid down in the Act of 1903, and was a condition given as a security to Parliament, that the Treasury would not be called upon to find the money. The noble Earl has referred to this as a technical error in the Act of 1903. He is very tender to his friends, but I think he was, I will not say unkind, but a little severe upon his opponents. Under this Bill the ratepayers will be relieved from the responsibility for this &#x00A3;640,000 a year.<lb/>
Now I come to the Treasury, and let us see how they are dealt with. The Treasury are generally supposed to have no friends, and though I do not agree with everything that has been said by my noble friend, I can quite understand sympathy even for the Treasury in the circumstances in which they are placed by the dilemma caused by the Act. The Treasury take over the liability for excess stock for pending agreements capitalised at seven and a-half millions. Instead of a bonus of twelve millions, including excess stock, on the bonus they will have to pay eighteen millions. The twelve millions were not given, as the noble Marquess seems to suppose, on the footing that everyone would get twelve per cent., but on the assumption that 100 millions would cover the purchase and that the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0282"/>
<col>551</col>
twelve millions should go as far as they could if the amount was over 100 millions. It was an absolute limit&#x2014;these are the words of Mr. Wyndham&#x2014;with regard to the bonus, and it now comes to eighteen millions. I never knew the Treasury in such a melting mood before. I think the Treasury have behaved with singular generosity, for not only will they pay this large sum, but they will have to find cash&#x2014;and this is an answer to one of the questions of the noble Marquess&#x2014;for all the compulsory purchases they may make under the Bill, if it passes, and they will have to pay the staff expenses. Taking all together, instead of there being the limit of twelve millions, as was contemplated under the Act of 1903, there will be loss to the Treasury estimated at about thirty millions. I think it was the noble Marquess, the Leader of the Opposition, who, in the course of the debate, and in default of making any practical suggestion, which I was most anxious to hear from him, said it would be wise to treat people generously in this matter. I think the Treasury have behaved generously on the figures I have just presented.<lb/>
I now come to the landlord. Of course, in a situation like this some sacrifice is to be expected from everybody. Let me take the case of the landlord. The landlord may stay as he is, waiting for the block to be removed, and pray remember that whenever landlords or tenants entered into an agreement under the Act, knowing the finances of it and the rate at which the purchases were to go through&#x2014;that it was not to be done at the rate of more than five millions a year&#x2014;they all knew there must be a block. They must have known it. What we ask them is that, if they like to stay as they are, very well, they will take their turn; but, if they do not, they have the option of taking payment in stock partly or wholly, and partly, or wholly in cash. My noble friend explained it was rather an intricate matter, but I think he explained it most clearly&#x2014;that there would be different lists, and one of the lists which would be early taken would be that of those sellers who were willing to take half in stock and half in shares, the stock being taken at a price of ninety-two. The tenants, it is true, sacrifice a quarter per cent. more in security. I regret it, but when a reconstruction, so to speak, has to be arrived at&#x2014;and no one really disputes that there must be a reconstruction&#x2014;have not the Treasury taken a
<col>552</col>
fair share of the burden, and is it not reasonable that a small contribution of that kind should be made by the other parties to this transaction in the circumstances to which I have alluded?<lb/>
I was very much entertained by the noble Marquess, the Leader of the Opposition, who said, When are we going to have an end of Land Bills? And he seemed to suggest that there was something approaching delinquency in our bringing forward this Irish Land Bill at all. I do not in the least mean to reproach him, but I think he might have remembered it has arisen out of the deadlock created by the miscalculation which was made in 1903. I thought myself, when he made that observation and asked that question, that I detected on the countenances of some of those noble Lords sitting behind him that irrepressible sense of humour which is the magic of Ireland.<lb/>
Let me turn to the other complaint that has been made. If you will permit me, as I know there are other speakers with a better title who wish to address the House, and as it is essentially a Committee point, I will not say anything at this stage about the composition of the new Congested Districts Board and the representative element upon it. It is an argument which requires dealing with. We shall meet it and deal with it in Committee, but, after all, that is a thing which is not one of the fundamental parts of the financial operations of the Bill. It may be an important part of the Bill and such as deserves discussion; but in the short time at my disposal I prefer to deal with the really substantial part of the Bill. And first, before I do that, may I refer to the statement which has been made that this Bill has not been discussed in the House of Commons? We have had figures given us about what the House of Commons did, how many hours they bestowed upon it, how many days&#x2014;a sort of time table of the proceedings of another place. Is it not rather delicate ground for one House of Parliament to take under its wing the internal proceedings of the other House, and to constitute ourselves <i>censores morum</i> of the other House of Parliament? I respectfully suggest that for the consideration of your Lordships. But let me just see. The tremendous offence on which Lord Dunraven adverted was that only eight days had been given to the Bill in Committee of the other House. I wonder why its important pro-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0283"/>
<col>553</col>
visions did not receive consideration in that time. I am not going to transgress in the direction which I have ventured to indicate; but let us take a hypothetical case. Suppose it were the case that in any imaginary House eight days were spent in debate upon trivial and unimportant questions, and therefore an important question was not reached. I suggest that as a hypothesis. That only eight days should be spent in Committee appears to shock the noble Marquess. He announced at the same time that this House would freely and fully discuss these important questions. I shall watch with interest whether we take eight days. I do not mean by that in any way to incite your Lordships to take a longer time, but I think that eight days in Committee, we will say in this House, is not an altogether inadequate time.<lb/>
Now I come to the question of zones. Your Lordships have been told repeatedly that His Majesty's Government by this Bill proposes to obliterate the zones, the beneficial effect of which has been so great. This is only one instance of what has taken place in the course of this debate, in which a great deal of zeal has been spent in defending what nobody attacks and in attacking what nobody defends. I agree the zones are excellent. We agreed with you on that in 1903. The peculiar merit of the zone system is that it saves a valuation of property which has been once valued. There is no great mystery in the zone system. I understood one of your Lordships to say, in regard to this particular branch of the subject that it was so confused that English or Scottish intelligences could hardly grasp its full meaning. It simply means that when you have valued a rent, if you take so many years' purchase you may assume to get the basis of a judicial rent and not require a second valuation. Nothing has surprised me more during this debate than the assumption that we are tearing up the whole system of the zones. We are doing nothing of the kind. I will tell your Lordships what we mean. Experience has shown&#x2014;this can be discussed in Committee&#x2014;that there are some cases&#x2014;I do not think many&#x2014;in which the very basis upon which the zone system rests has failed. For example, the judicial rent may be an agreed rent which has not been subject to revision by the Court. Surely, it is a modest request that where the very essence of the zone system is in a particular case violated because there is not in fact a
<col>554</col>
judicial decision, though there may be in form, you should be at liberty to ask that your security should be established to your satisfaction by showing that the price is a reasonable and equitable one. That is our intention. It is in the Bill, and if it is not clearly expressed in the Bill, it will be made the subject of criticism when the clause is reached in Committee.<lb/>
There is another point that has been dwelt upon repeatedly in the course of the debate. There have been but few points dwelt upon, but these few points have been repeated and enlarged upon, I do not say unduly, but with every kind of apprehension that something disastrous and wicked is being enacted. The point I wish now to take is compulsory purchase. The question was put to us, "Do the Government run a voluntary or a compulsory system of purchase?" I answer at once, "We run a voluntary system." It is our wish to maintain the voluntary system. It is clear that if you have concurrently two systems competing with each other&#x2014;the voluntary and compulsory&#x2014;the compulsory, like Aaron's rod, must eat up the voluntary. It really did not require the elaboration devoted to it. What we mean, what has been stated by my noble friend the Leader of the House is this. We mean compulsion to be exceptional and to be supplementary to the voluntary system. I am sure I need not enlarge upon this; at least if I cannot induce your Lordships to agree with me by stating it I do not propose to elaborate it. Is it not the case that there may be estates in Ireland where it is desirable in the public interest there should be a change? I think the Leader of the Opposition, and certainly Lord Dunraven, admitted there may be cases of that kind. Are there not cases also possible in which you may need for the relief of congestion to acquire property, not at a distance&#x2014;because people do not wish to have congests from outside thrust upon them, having people of their own to provide for&#x2014;but land in the particular neighbourhood? Are there not cases like that? All I say is if you desire the purposes for which, and the occasions upon which, compulsory powers are to be employed to be stated, there is no objection to those powers being limited by some reasonable definition. All this was said by my noble friend the Leader of the House. But the statement has been entirely ignored by your Lordships and some of those who took part in the debate have spoken as though they proceeded on the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0284"/>
<col>555</col>
belief that some great expropriation of the land of Ireland was intended by the Bill, that we were replanting or resettling half of Ireland, and that every man's property was to be at the mercy of the Estates Commissioners, or, indeed, of one of them. That is not the intention of the Government. We have stated in terms clear and deliberate what we do mean.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, referred to the machinery and objected to it in the strongest terms. He said the final offer was the original offer, and that it was to be framed upon the footing, not of the real price, but of the price&#x2014;I have forgotten the words, but of the price offered by the tenant or other person. It may be cumbrous, though I do not think it is, but the scheme is this. If the Estates Commissioners desire to acquire a piece of land for reasons which are sufficient, then they make an offer for it. They may, in the first place, inspect it. Then they make a final offer&#x2014;that is a firm, a fixed offer which they cannot withdraw from. If it is accepted, well and good. If it is not accepted, then the thing goes to be tried by the valuer irrespective of what the tenants or others may offer. The true value is to be fixed by the Judicial Commissioner, and I believe the Judicial Commissioner enjoys the confidence of noble Lords in Ireland. This is the other terrible evil which called forth so much of the oratory of Lord Curzon and of other noble Lords. I am stating it in prosaic, I am afraid in very prosaic, language, and I cannot see that it forms a better basis than a good many other things for the suggestions of robbery, confiscation, spoilation, and Socialism, and all the other numerous sins of which His Majesty's Government are said to be guilty.<lb/>
Let me come to another question Do you propose, it is asked, to provide for landless men? Is that the design of Clause 17? And I was asked by the noble Marquess to define "any other person." In the first place, powers are given in order, as my noble friend the Leader of the House pointed out, to deal with exceptional parcels. At present you cannot sell those parcels. I will not be guilty of the indiscretion of again referring to the house with laurel bushes and the mill, but, as a matter of business, you ought to have the power of
<col>556</col>
selling. The noble Marquess who last addressed the House said there would always be liability to very great difficulty when you had to plant congests&#x2014;I do not like the phrase, but I think it is understood&#x2014;in surroundings which are not in their own neighbourhood. There is a provision in the Act of 1903 by which land in some circumstances may be given to the sons of tenants or, I think it is, to persons in the neighbourhood. This is the clause I am told which is really the origin of the agitation by the landless men because, before it was introduced, the whole scope of the Irish Land Acts so far as they related to purchase was to fix tenants and to regulate the relations between landlords and tenants. It is in some cases impossible to deal with the question of migration if the Commissioners are not entitled to give some consideration to the claims of the landless men&#x2014;I adopt the phrase&#x2014;in the locality. The Government must try and effect some working arrangement where the congests are concerned if they can.<lb/>
These landless men are tenants, sons of tenants, successful herds, or agricultural labourers of a good type, who are strong agriculturists, and they are the stamp of men who are first introduced by the Act of 1903. It is because you cannot deal with congests without some powers of this kind that this clause finds its place in the Bill. I think there is nothing wrong in that. It is nothing but what is reasonable. You have to deal with an exceptional and difficult situation, and this is the way in which the Government think that it is best to deal with it. Now I think I have referred, not to every minor point, for that would not be expected in a Second Reading debate, but to every considerable or big objection which has been made to this Bill. Your Lordships may judge. I have at all events tried to. I have asked leave to postpone the question of the constitution of the Congested Districts Board which is too long for the present occasion. I have referred to the zones, to the compulsory powers, and to the landless men, which are the three things which have filled up this debate. The answers which I have given, my Lords, are the answers of the Government, and I can only say, in conclusion, that I think our proposals ought to be received and considered in a fair spirit because they are fair dealing proposals and are not introduced for any of the malignant or
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0285"/>
<col>557</col>
ulterior purposes which have been rather ungenerously attributed to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01614"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in my humble protest against many of the provisions of this Bill I shall have to traverse ground which has already been covered by previous speakers, and, in that respect, I may have to ask the indulgence of the House. My task is rendered somewhat more difficult from the fact that I have to follow the noble and learned Lord, whose persuasive powers are so well known. But, even with all those powers, I think he has failed to make out a good case for the Bill before the House. I have learned something, however, from the noble and learned Lord, who is a past master in the art of debate&#x2014;namely, that when you are in difficulty about a point or principle the defence of which presents difficulties to your mind, what you do is to relegate it to the Committee stage. After all, the question of the composition of the Congested Districts Board is a very important point. I am afraid I shall have to dwell rather more largely upon it than the noble and learned Lord thought it necessary to do. It seems to me that in dealing with a measure of Irish land purchase, and especially when that measure proposes most important and drastic alterations and really advocates an entirely new line of policy, it is sometimes helpful just to look back for a moment and cast your mind over the past history of the question, and the different stages and phases through which it has passed. To the vast majority of your Lordships the whole story is familiar, too familiar perhaps, but there may be others interested in the system of land tenure in Ireland and England and in the bearing the one has upon the other to whom it is not so familiar.<lb/>
I need not go farther back than the Act of 1881, because all later land legislation comes as the natural result of the situation created by the passing of that Act. At that time dual ownership appeared. It was created by three things given to the tenants&#x2014;fixity of tenure, whereby they remained in their holdings and could not be put out except for non-payment of rent; fair rent, which provided them with a Land Court, which fixed the rent and revised it every fifteen years; a free sale, which gave them the right to part with their interest at any time to anybody. The landlord
<col>558</col>
and tenant were forced into partnership and became unwilling occupiers of the some bed, rather an uncomfortable condition for both. But it was early recognised by landlords and by all who had the interest of agricultural land at heart that the system of dual ownership was an impossible one, and, moreover, harmful to the agricultural and economic development of Ireland. Various schemes were thought out, the landlords being desirious of selling their interest, and many Acts were passed with the object of setting up machinery for the transfer of land from owner to occupier. But the terms offered by these Acts were neither tempting nor satisfactory enough to bring about a deal on any large scale, and matters drifted on till in 1902 the impossibility of further continuance of this dual ownership and the harm it was having on agriculture in Ireland were pressed home, and a conference took place between the representatives of landlords and the tenants. As a result, we had the Act of which we have heard so much, the great Wyndham Act of 1903, if I may so call it, which embodied to a certain extent the terms of the conference with modifications. The result of that Act is, of course, well known to your Lordships, but I would like to give a figure or two to show what it has accomplished. Its results have been excellent. Whereas during the twenty-two years from 1881 to 1903 under the various Land Acts &#x00A3;21,000,000 was advanced to 63,000 tenants for purchase, between 1903 and October 31, 1908, &#x00A3;25,000,000 was absolutely paid out to 69,000 tenants, and agreements between landlords in the case of further 173,000 tenants and involving &#x00A3;54,000,000 were entered into, thus showing that what was aimed at in previous Land Acts and had been long felt necessary by all parties was on a fair road to accomplishment under the Act of 1903.<lb/>
That brings me to the contemplation of the present situation before your Lordships' House. One of the chief complaints I have to make about this Bill is that it opens the ball by deliberately tearing up the financial agreement between the Treasury and Ireland. In 1903 a bargain was struck and a contract made and agreed upon by all parties&#x2014;the landlord, the tenant, Parliament, and last, but not least, the Treasury. The noble Earl the Leader of the House seemed to indicate that he failed as yet to understand how it was that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0286"/>
<col>559</col>
that contract was agreed upon in such a manner. He seemed to think it was due to a certain levity, to the idea that there was an era of hopefulness springing up in Ireland, and to many other circumstances which he did not quote, but which no doubt he had in his mind. But the fact remains that the agreement was agreed upon. It was no doubt subjected to all the financial experts of the Treasury first. Where is that agreement in the Bill now before the Horse? I am not financier enough to follow the details to say, but this I know, that in the very opening words of the Bill future tenant purchasers are asked to pay &#x00A3;3 10<i>s</i>. instead of &#x00A3;3 5<i>s</i>. as the rate of their purchase annuity. I think I am right in saying that that amounts to something more than &#x00A3;20,000,000 which has to be taken out of Ireland by the Treasury. The noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, in his speech seemed to indicate that the tenants were to be relieved of the extra burden due to the fact that they were to pay &#x00A3;3 10<i>s</i>. because the landlord was the man who would suffer, inasmuch as he was to accept, under compulsion, two or three years less purchase than he had got hitherto. But, my Lords, if the system of compulsion in the Bill falls to the ground the tenant still pays his &#x00A3;3 10<i>s</i>. instead of &#x00A3;3 5<i>s</i>. Past history goes to show that representatives of Ireland and the Irish people have swallowed before now the English bait, not always to their internal comfort. That tenant purchasers in Ireland can be guiled into believing that an extra quarter per cent on their purchase annuity, whereby they are mulcted of twenty millions, is good and wholesome medicine for a malady that is being rapidly cured by present methods, I really find hard to believe.<lb/>
No, the position cannot lead to further progress in land purchase. Rather will the effect be otherwise. It will lead, I believe, to cessation of land purchase, and it will set adrift once more the spirits of unrest and discontent. What is the attraction? Some attraction there must be which is offered to representatives of the Irish people to disarm opposition to this proposal. It would appear to lie in the third part of the Bill, in which they are given the idea that they are to have a free hand in the distribution of grass lands in the West&#x2014;a flattering, but as I think I shall show, an illusory idea&#x2014;and, in addition, the free handling of a quarter
<col>560</col>
of a million of money. So much for the tenants' interest.<lb/>
What about the landlord? The landlord is given the option of two things. He can either take payment in stock or in cash. The former holds out hopes to him of some earlier settlement, whilst the latter foreshadows the indefinite postponement of the completion of his sale, inasmuch as all settlements in land stock are to have priority. He is between the devil and the deep sea. If he takes payment in cash he may have to suffer an indefinite postponement, while his former experience under previous Land Acts has given him an absolute desire to have payments in cash, and the bargain of 1903 was that he was to have payment in cash. The Chief Secretary has stated in another place that anything which would affect the transfer of land and land purchase in Ireland would be an economic and political blunder of very great magnitude; and yet he is himself responsible for a Bill which, if it has not that very object in view, at any rate can only bring about that as a result.<lb/>
I come to what I regard as another very serious blot upon the Bill&#x2014;namely, the manner in which it is proposed to deal with the relief of congestion, a study of which I have had to make during the past eight years as a member of the Congested Districts Board. The problem of the relief of congestion is a thorny one and beset with difficulties, and it is of very large proportions. The Report which I have in my hand says that in the nine counties which are proposed to be scheduled as congested there are 80,000 holdings which require enlargement and improvement. Our policy on the Congested Districts Board has always been to encourage migration, and this migration seems to have fanned in some mysterious way the flame of land hunger, until a situation has arisen in which landless men have put forward claims of ever growing proportions. The noble Earl said that landless men were not heard of in his palmy days of administration in Ireland. That is perfectly true. They are a by-product, which has arisen quite latterly, and it was stated by the noble Earl and also by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack that they are really a product of the Act of 1903. With due respect, I must disagree with the manner in which they have interpreted
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0287"/>
<col>561</col>
that Act. It seems to me the landless men were brought into the Act in a perfectly different manner and from a perfectly different point of view. There is nothing in the Act of 1903, at any rate, which showed that a preference should be given to landless men as against congests. But let me explain my interpretation of the Act with regard to landless men. They were brought in under the following conditions. There might be a case in which the State had purchased a congested estate which, we will say, contained 500 acres of untenanted land. We will say that 300 acres of that untenanted land had been used up for the purpose of congests and another 100 acres for the evicted tenants, so that there remained yet another 100 acres. Rather than that the State should remain perpetual landlords, or that the 100 acres should be put up for auction, provision was made in the Act of 1903 that those 100 acres might be given to any landless men. That is a very different proposition from that which is urged&#x2014;namely, that the Act of 1903 introduced these landless men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01615"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My idea of the position simply was that the landless men came into being by the inception of something beyond the direct sale from landlord to tenant; that was the first change that started the possibility of obtaining land except as a tenant buying from the landlord. I do not go further than that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01616"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: At any rate, we are all agreed about this, that the congests should have priority of claim as against landless men. Yet in Clause 17 of the Bill His Majesty's Government uses language which countenances the landless man as against the congest. This has been repeatedly disclaimed, I know, by His Majesty's Government and by noble Lords who sit opposite. Well, then, if that is so, let them disclaim it by Amendment in the Bill. My Lords, I come to the new Congested Districts Board, which I am afraid I may say more about than the Lord Chancellor thought fit to say. It is an extraordinary idea that you should set up a composite board of twenty members, some <i>ex officio</i>, some elected, and some nominated, perfectly independent in their actions, and who are to take over all the work of land transfer in these new congested districts and all the work has hitherto been carried on by the Congested Districts Board.

I say it is a novel position, and there is no instance on record where such a task has been entrusted to a body independent of State control. It has been stated in another place that, after all, this new Congested Districts Board is not to be independent of State control, as we think, because in Clause 51 of the Bill the Lord Lieutenant may do all sorts of wonderful things. He may regulate everything by Order in Council. Well, if that is so, why bring in the elective element at all? I think the idea of nine elected members representing local prejudice and bound more or less by local agitation, which at present is all in favour of the landless men, is really a most mischievous principle.<lb/>
It has been argued also that if so much objection is taken to the elective principle upon this new Board, why was the elective principle introduced by a Unionist Administration which set up the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Ireland. It is perfectly true that that Department consists of a council, two-thirds of whom are nominated by the county council, who, in their turn, nominate two-thirds of the Agricultural Board, which has a veto upon the spending of the Department's funds. If this is the basis which His Majesty's Government have taken for the constitution of their new Congested Districts Board, I think it would have been far simpler, instead of setting up a new Department, to have taken this Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction as the body for carrying out the work hitherto carried on by the Congested Districts Board. I would have no objection to that. The Agricultural Board have passed a Minute claiming their fitness for this work and stating their willingness to undertake it, except anything connected with land purchase. Now that could have been done, as has been said by other speakers, by the Estates Commissioners who have been dealing with land transfer, which is the very object of their existence, and they have been dealing with congestion in other parts of Ireland, for I would remind your Lordships that there is congestion not only in Connaught but in Ulster as well as other parts of Ireland. You have the machinery in hand, and there is no doubt that the whole of the work of the Congested Districts Board might have been divided between these two departments.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0288"/>
<col>563</col>
Is it to the benefit of Ireland that there should be a further partition of the country? We already see a theoretical division between North and South, and is it really to the benefit of Ireland that you should now divide the East from the West? Are the fish in some waters to be congests and the fish in others to be non-congests? That is to say, are the Western fish always to be congests and the Eastern fish non-congests? Surely it would have been saner policy to develop the administrative work of an admittedly progressive and thoroughly efficient body of men such as the Department of Agriculture and to give it a national policy which would at any rate have made for harmony, in contradistinction to setting up a Congested Districts Board which must result in overlapping and friction. I should like to remind your Lordships that there has been a Minute passed by the Belfast Chamber of Commerce setting very forcibly forward the arguments for and objections against this part of the Bill. It represents the views of sound business men who have realised that the welfare of our home commerce is largely dependent upon the prosperity and progress of the agricultural industry&#x2014;in fact, the two must go hand in hand. I commend this Minute to your Lordships as coming from a body of Irishmen possessing a well-established and worldwide reputation for sane and business-like methods in commerce and finance.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not intend to dwell at any length upon the principle of compulsion. It has been thoroughly put forward by other speakers in your Lordships' House, but this I will say, that I join in the general chorus of disapproval of any recourse to compulsion where voluntary methods have succeeded so well. Whether compulsion is to be permitted for a definite degree of congestion is a point which I admit is arguable, and will be argued, I have no doubt, when we reach a later stage. But, on this side of the House we have, I hope, proved that if this Bill is to have a Second Reading at your Lordships' hands it must be drastically amended in Committee, and I believe we are all agreed that it cannot leave this House in the shape in which it made its entrance. We have endeavoured to indicate the lines upon which the Bill might be amended, and I am glad to think, from the remarks which fell from the noble Earl who introduced this Bill, that when we come to the Com-
<col>564</col>
mittee stage His Majesty's Government will sympathetically consider Amendments moved on the lines we have indicated. Of this I am quite sure, that the Bill cannot leave your Lordships' House in its present form, and we may have to appeal to the majority of your Lordships' House when we come to the Committee stage; but if that appeal is made, it will not be from the point of view of a landlord who looks not beyond the confines of his estate or to whom personal interest is paramount. We want to see Ireland happy and contented, and, above all, we wish to see stability in the management of Irish affairs. Ireland has lost much and has suffered much from frequent changes of policy on the part of successive administrations. We have had a direct agreement entered into and accepted by all parties. Is it not natural, therefore, that we on this side of the House should desire to stand by those principles, and is it not the duty of the State to see them through? I think it behoves us to allow nothing to pass that may hinder or undo the good work that has been begun. It requires only, here and there, a judicious step forward to enable it to attain to maturity to the benefit&#x2014;the lasting benefit, I think I may say&#x2014;of Ireland and the Irish people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01617"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill contains proposals so novel, and it is so far-reaching in its effects, that even if it had come to your Lordships as the result of full and adequate discussion in another place I doubt whether its proposals wonld have been acceptable to the majority of this House. But what has been the history of the Bill? We have heard from other speakers how it was put down for consideration on Friday after Friday when the vast majority of Members, exhausted from vigils from the previous Monday, were seeking a few hours of well-earned repose, and those jaded Members who were present found it impossible adequately to discuss the provisions of the Bill owing to the use of the closure. The most contentious clauses were passed by means of the closure, not only without discussion, but also without explanation or attempt at justification by the Minister in charge. The Divisions on those clauses which were discussed showed a Government majority getting beautifully less and less, until, on one occasion, the Government were only
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0289"/>
<col>565</col>
saved from defeat by a majority of eight votes. And this is a Bill which has been hurled at your Lordships' heads in the closing days of September with a threat that if you do not pass it the most unpleasant consequences will follow.<lb/>
We are led to understand that the friends of disorder in Ireland who, to use their own classic diction, have "given Birrell a chance," will in their turn be given a chance by the right hon. gentleman during the long winter nights that will be shortly upon us. I do not believe there is one of your Lordships on either side of the House who will be affected by these threats or who will not try to do what he thinks his duty in this matter. So far as I am concerned, I should be inclined to dismiss this Bill with as little consideration as it received in its passage up to us were it not for one clause in it. I daresay many of your Lordships remember the well-known story of a famous sermon delivered by an eloquent prelate on an epoch-making occasion, and the observation afterwards of a cleric who remarked that there was not enough gospel in it to save a tom-tit. I have found in this clause just enough gospel to save this tom-tit. I refer to the clause which relieves the Irish taxpayer from a liability he incurred under the Act of 1903&#x2014;I venture to say through excessive zeal on the part of the Treasury&#x2014;and which I think all sides agree it was never intended should be carried into effect.<lb/>
This Bill professes to be a corollary, and a necessary corollary, of the Act of 1903. Let me shortly remind your Lordships what that Act was. It was a treaty of peace made between the landlord and the tenants of Ireland, solemnly ratified and confirmed by the State. It was an attempt, and a successful attempt, to do away with the system of dual ownership which was introduced in 1881, which proved the bane of Ireland, and which might go down to posterity, coupled with the curse of Cromwell, as the curse of Gladstone. It enabled landlords and tenants to come together as free men to arrange within certain limits, terms of sale and purchase. The tenants on becoming owners of their holdings paid annuities considerably less than they had previously paid in rent. Landlords were consoled for parting with their acres by payment in hard cash, and the State, which ratified the proceedings and provided the money
<col>566</col>
necessary to carry it out, was amply secured, as has been pointed out, in the first place by the fact that the tenant's annuity was much less than the rent he had previously paid; secondly, by the security of his tenant right; and, thirdly, by those improvements which it was believed by the magic of property were bound to be made to his new possession. The Act was mainly intended to make occupying tenants owners of their land. It was certainly intended, in cases where holdings were too small, that a certain amount of the grass land adjoining should be voluntarily purchased to enlarge them, but in the main the graziers were to be left as in time past, the great middle-classes of Ireland, the backbone of the country, the pliers of its most successful industry, to furnish a market for the young stock of the new owners, and the grass lands were to remain the property of landlords to furnish an example by their rich pasture land, their well-kept fences and drains, of what the land of Ireland could be made when in capable hands.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, let us examine the present Bill, and I must really take the present Bill as I find it here and not the good intentions of the Government as explained by the Lord Chancellor. In the first place, we find that the tenant who purchases under this Bill of a Home Rule Chief Secretary has to pay a considerably higher annuity than his more fortunate brother who purchases under a Land Act of a Unionist Government, and the landlord instead of being paid in cash is paid in depreciated stock, which must tend more and more to depreciate as he is forced to throw it on the market. As to the graziers of Ireland, that great body&#x2014;what of them, my Lords? So far as I can make out they are to be done away with in order that the executive of the United Irish League&#x2014;for such in fact, if not in name, will be the reconstituted Congested Districts Board&#x2014;may be able to reward the most stalwart supporters of their policy of cattle-driving, and to place on the grass lands of Ireland corner-boys without capital, without assiduity, and without knowledge of farming.<lb/>
And to do this it is proposed that these grass lands should be purchased compulsorily. I ask why compulsorily? The noble Earl, Lord Granard, gave us an answer to that question. He stated that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0290"/>
<col>567</col>
during the eighteen years that the Congested Districts Board has existed there have been thirty-two cases in which landlords have refused to sell at the price the Congested Districts Board offered them. Surely that does not mean that they would not accept a just value if it were offered them. It merely means that they do not consider what was offered to them the full value of the land. The noble Lord also mentioned a number of landlords who refused to sell their grass land, but he forgets that no one thought of selling his grass-land until 1903, and he does not tell us how many instances there have been since the new policy was introduced in 1903. He further told us that a great many landlords made no reply to the circular sent out by the Congested Districts, Board. I think a great many people when they received the circular thought it was ample time to reply when they understood the Board was taking active steps to acquire their land, and I have heard of instances where the Board sent out to know if landlords were willing to sell grass-lands which did not belong to them. But I think we may say that the landlords of Ireland, whatever they may think of the policy as an economical one of turning the grass lands of Ireland into agricultural holdings, and however sorry they may be to part with land with which their families have been associated for many generations they are perfectly ready to allow this experiment of the Government to be tried if they are only certain of getting an adequate price for their land. I ask, what is an adequate price?<lb/>
I had the honour of a conversation with a distinguished Radical politician&#x2014;and so many Radical politicians are distinguished that I am not in any way betraying the identity of the gentleman in question&#x2014;who said that if he were valuing my grass lands he could not help being influenced in his valuation by the thought which would come into his head that they would depreciate in value owing to the introduction in the near future of Canadian cattle, to which I replied that if I had to value his grass lands I could not help being influenced by the thought that they would appreciate in value by the advent in the near future of Tariff Reform. The one opinion is as good as the other. If we can get at facts they are much more important. What prices have been given during the past year and are still given by solvent tenants
<col>568</col>
for these lands? I only speak for myself and do not bind any other member of the Party to which I have the honour to belong, but I think the least that can be offered to landlords for their grass lands is twenty years' purchase on the gross rental which they have received for an average of seven years previously.<lb/>
I do not know whether the noble Earl, if he winds up the debate, will tell me that that is unreasonable or will take refuge in generalities and say that the tribunal the Government have appointed consists of gentlemen who have actual experience and that we may trust to their impartiality. If he does, I know it is not the habit to attack members of the Civil Service who are not able to defend themselves; but without doing so I think I may say we do not consider them to be the proper judges of the value of our lands for four reasons. The first of, these is that they are the purchasers themselves, and I do not think I need dwell further on this point. It seems to me it must be apparent to everybody that the purchaser is the last person who should fix the price he is willing to give for a thing. The second is that they are precluded by the words of this Bill from giving a fair price, and are obliged to consider not the value of the land, but what the people to whom they are willing to sell it will give for it. The third reason is that we know from the evidence of some of these gentlemen given before the Dudley Commission what their views are with regard to the value of land. Mr. Commissioner Bailey states that:&#x2014;
<quote>"Many owners seek for a price that will give them their income on the basis of their grazing lettings. This, of course, is, impossible."</quote>
They may have received this rent for ten, twelve, or fifteen years, but to accept it as the basis of purchase&#x2014;
<quote>"would mean our purchasing the land at a price that we could not dream of re-selling it at to an occupying purchaser."</quote>
He further states that an outside tribunal ignorant of their redistribution schemes might fix those prices too high. It is but fair to Mr. Bailey to say that those remarks were only made with regard to voluntary purchase of land. What does Mr. Finucane say? He says&#x2014;
<quote>"A man might receive &#x00A3;2 an acre for eleven months (as a grazing rent), but a yearly tenant might only pay, say, for that, &#x00A3;1 an acre; so that the two things are different."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0291"/>
<col>569</col>
There is a fourth reason. To prove my case it is necessary that I should quote figures. There are two cases&#x2014;I will not mention the names for obvious reasons, but if the noble Earl would like to know the names I should be glad to give them to him privately. In one case the owner received &#x00A3;35 a year as rent, in addition to which he received &#x00A3;10 a year for shooting rent from a neighbouring landlord. This rent had been paid for seventeen or eighteen years, and the man who had given it expressed his willingness, if my friend remained the owner, to take a lease for ten or twenty years more. I do not say that this ought to count as the same value as freehold, but it was a valuable asset to him, and at any rate he receives at present &#x00A3;45 a year for this land. The Estates Commissioners offered him &#x00A3;556. He appealed to have this increased; and the grazier who had farmed the land for the previous twenty years appeared before them and stated his willingness to become a statutory tenant of the land at the same rent. The Estates Commissioners listened to his representation, and increased their offer to &#x00A3;620. My friend appealed to the Judicial Commissioners. His appeal was dismissed, and the costs, which amounted to &#x00A3;40, were not allowed. So for what he had previously received &#x00A3;45 a year, he will now receive, deducting &#x00A3;40, &#x00A3;580. As he is a limited owner and has to invest this at three and a-half per cent, he will receive &#x00A3;20 6<i>s</i>. for what he previously received &#x00A3;45. Another instance is of a former rent of &#x00A3;64 and an offer of &#x00A3;852, twelve and a-half years purchase; and another instance is &#x00A3;24 a year and an offer of &#x00A3;326, thirteen and a-half years purchase. Is it astonishing that under these circumstances we do not trust the Estates Commissioners as a tribunal to fix a price of our grass lands?<lb/>
We know what happens in these cases. A young man is sent down from the Land Commission offices. He does not seek out the grazier and find out if he is satisfied with his bargain, but fixes his own price&#x2014;what he thinks agricultural tenants will give for it, and we have it on the evidence of Mr. Finucane that they may be exactly half of what the grazing rent is. After that he takes fifteen per cent, for State security, and on reduced rent offers twenty-six and a-half years purchase, These are not my figures but they are the evidence of Mr. Stuart, one of the chief
<col>570</col>
officers of the Land Commission, and I should like to point out the difference in the interest that results. Twenty years purchase on &#x00A3;100 would be &#x00A3;2,000. The Land Commissioners would at once reduce the &#x00A3;100 to half and take off fifteen per cent, for State security. That makes it &#x00A3;42 10<i>s</i>. Taking that at twenty-six and a-half years purchase it would be &#x00A3;1,105. If the landlord had to invest at three and a-half per cent. he would receive &#x00A3;38 10<i>s</i>. instead of the &#x00A3;100 a year he had previously received, and there would be no question of bonus being added to this because we are told that in cases of twenty-six years purchase and upwards there is no bonus, and that in the case of a purchase of untenanted land the number of years purchase shall be calculated "in the manner prescribed by the Treasury." We know why land is reduced from &#x00A3;2 an acre so that the tenant may only pay 17<i>s</i>. an acre. It is given by Mr. Doran in his evidence. He says the tenant is able to go on letting it to the grazier to whom the landlord let it before and thus "accumulates a little capital" from the difference.<lb/>
There are some noble Lords who are said to be converts to the principle of compulsion being extended to Ireland. But the principles of the case are very different in England and Ireland. In England every acre of land outside your park walls will not be compulsorily taken, and the purchaser is not the man who fixes the price. In England there is an allowance made for severance and for the depreciation of the rest of time property, and also for land being taken compulsory. None of those things is allowed for in Ireland. There is only one other point. That is the question of income tax. Both Schedules A and B are charged on untenanted land. Let me take the case of a farm which lets for &#x00A3;100 a year. Take the poor law valuation as &#x00A3;80. On Schedules A and B income tax would be paid on &#x00A3;96 10<i>s</i>., if it is sold on the terms I have just named the landlord will only pay in future on &#x00A3;38 10<i>s</i>. I hope some noble Lord will call the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to this fact. It might be interesting to find how it would work out if applied to the whole of the untenanted land in Ireland. I have only touched really one of the many problems which abound in this Bill, but the question of congestion is one which affects those of us who live in the west of Ireland very closely, and I thought it my
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0292"/>
<col>571</col>
duty as far as possible to put the case before your Lordships as to our difficulties in this matter. I wish to make it clear that while we are perfectly ready to sell our grass lands for the benefit of State purposes, if it is thought desirable that we should do so, we are not prepared to accept any terms of compulsion unless His Majesty's Government can show us clearly when we reach the Committee stage that they cannot acquire land voluntarily at such a price that will enable landlords to receive their net income when invested at three and a half per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01618"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that your Lordships have been struck by what seems to me the salient feature of this debate, and that is the extraordinary differences that we find between the Government Bill and the Government speeches. We claim that this Bill abolishes the zone system, and I think the drafting of Clause 14 is perfectly clear upon that point. The clause says, "If the Land Commissioners are satisfied that circumstances exist which, in their opinion, necessitate inquiry," &amp;c. The zones are in future, by the proposals of the Government Bill, to be absolutely at the discretion of the Estates Commissioners. That is what we call abolishing the zones. Indeed, in the Third Reading debate in the House of Commons the Chief Secretary defended this clause and used very strong language about it. He said that it was his desire that the Estates Commissioners in those cases under consideration in connection with the zones should be given an opportunity to strike a blow. Now we hear from the speeches of the noble Earl who leads the House and the speeches of the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, that these provisions which are asked for in Clause 14 are only desirable in order that they may be used in exceptional cases, and I notice that the Lord Chancellor spoke of one case which he considers, and I believe rightly, an exceptional case; that is to say, the case where there is an agreed rent which is to take the place of a judicial rent. But that is not the proposal in the Bill. We note the noble and learned Lord's offer to put that proposal in the Bill, though, of course, I am not in a position to say whether or not that would satisfy my friends from Ireland.<lb/>
On the question of compulsory purchase, unquestionably Clause 43, read in connection with Part IV of the Bill, sets up a universal system of compulsory purchase. There is no limit to it whatever. We now under-
<col>572</col>
stand from the Leader of the House and from the Lord Chancellor that these powers again are only required for particular and exceptional cases. Again, my Lords, there is no mention of exceptional cases in the Bill. The Bill could not possibly have been drawn wider than it now is. The Bill as drafted, we maintain, opens the door as wide as possible to the landless men. We now understand from the Government speeches that these powers are only required for exceptional cases. Why are not those exceptional cases in the Bill? At any rate I think my noble friends from Ireland can congratulate themselves that we have made some progress. I have only had a very short experience of your Lordships' House. There are many Members with very much greater experience than I have, but has any one of your Lordships even seen a Government Bill come up from the House of Commons and the representatives of the Government tumbling over each other on Second Reading to amend it? We shall be very interested indeed in discussing this Irish Land (No. 2) Bill when it is submitted to us in Committee next Tuesday. As I have said, I am not, of course, in a position to say whether the Amendments suggested to us will be satisfactory or not, but I think I may say this, that whereas no case has been shown in the course of this debate for the proposals that are in the Bill neither has any case yet been shown for the Amendments that are suggested, and we shall be interested to see whether any case can be shown for them at a future stage. But I cannot help asking one question. If really what we have been told in the course of this debate is the proposal of the Government, why was nothing said about these things in the House of Commons either in Committee or on Report? There was absolutely no sign of what I may call this conciliatory spirit in the course of the debates in another place. I was very much struck to notice that on the Third Reading the Chief Secretary declared himself without hesitation a tenant's man. He did not use that exact phrase, but undoubtedly he did come down upon the tenant's side of the fence, and I am sure whilst your Lordships will be given no explanation of this phenomenon you will all take very careful note of it.<lb/>
I desire to associate myself with the wish of many of your Lordships not to go into the details of this Bill, which we will, perhaps, be better able to discuss in Committee. Therefore, I will only deal very shortly with one or two of the financial proposals that have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0293"/>
<col>573</col>
not yet been dealt with. But first I should like to refer to one statement by the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, in which he spoke of a great many leading landlords as having been at some time or other if not now in favour of compulsion. I have only been connected with the Irish Landowners Convention for some five or six years, but I have had the opportunity since that statement was made of communicating with Mr. Willis, who has been secretary for over twenty years. This is what he writes to me in one sentence&#x2014;
<quote>"As to Lord MacDonnell's statement about 'a great many landlords,' it is curious that the landowners Convention has never heard of them, and that the Convention has been unanimously passing resolutions against compulsory purchase in almost every year, and certainly in connection with every land Bill, since 1887 without any of these supposed dissentients making any protest."</quote>
The Irish Landowners Convention is known to be supported by landlords in every single county in Ireland, and I do not hesitate for one moment to assert that if there had been one leading landlord in favour of compulsory purchase we should, have heard about it in the Irish Landowners Convention meetings on more occasions than one. I hope we shall hear no more of this suggestion that there have been leading landlords in Ireland in favour of compulsion in any shape or form.<lb/>
I only desire now to refer to one or two of the financial aspects of this Bill that I think have not been referred to. As I have said, the details of the rest of the Bill will probably be much better raised in Committee, but I presume that a number of the financial proposals will not be conveniently raised in Committee. That is my excuse for dealing with them now. I do not desire to go in any detail into the general aspect of the case, for that was dealt with in the absolutely unanswered speech of Lord Curzon, whom I am sure all Irishmen are very glad to welcome in his first speech in your Lordships' House on Irish affairs. I accept, of course, the difficulties of the financial position as being the primary necessity for this Bill. I was not, if I may say so with all respect, very much struck with the simile of the noble Earl the Leader of the House when he compared what we have to do now to a scheme of reconstruction between three classes of shareholders, and when he asked us therefore to approach it as a business proposition. I do not feel at all like a shareholder in this matter. I feel rather like a party to a contract who has
<col>574</col>
fulfilled his part of the bargain and who has been asked by one of the other parties to the contract to let him off a portion of his part of the bargain and to share some of the loss that he finds put upon him as a result of arrangements made six years ago. I think this Bill was very rightly described by Lord Dunraven as a "Treasury Relief Bill." We are interested to hear that in future &#x00A3;2,000,000 a year is to be set aside for payments in cash; &#x00A3;2,000,000 of cash is to be set aside for those, as I think, extremely stupid individuals who will agree to accept half in stock and half in cash. But, remember, stock is not a full description of what you are going to offer landlords. You are going to offer landlords stock which is worth eighty-five at ninety-two. We have had no justification of that proposal from noble Lords opposite. The only mention of the words "ninety-two" that I heard came from the Lord Chancellor. I had hopes that we were to have some justification for the proposal which is made for giving stock at ninety-two which is now worth only eighty-five, but noble Lords opposite have carefully avoided the least mention of this very important provision in the Bill.<lb/>
The Report of Mr. Runciman's Committee&#x2014;a Report with almost every word of which we disagree, and a Report the evidence of which has never been shown to the public&#x2014;says, on what authorty I cannot imagine, that landlords who are given stock at ninety-two, although it is only worth eighty-five or any other price, will keep it because they will obtain a three per cent. investment. All the evidence that I can find before the Dudley Commission proved conclusively that every landlord who gets cash can expect to get from &#x00A3;3 11s. to &#x00A3;3 12s. per cent. as the result of money he invests from purchase in trustee securities. Is it seriously imagined that anybody is going to be so stupid, if he is an entirely free agent, as to take stock at ninety-two which is only worth eighty-five, to take stock which is going to pay him three per cent. when he has the right to expect cash which will enable him to re-invest in investments which will pay him another ten shillings or eleven shillings per cent. If he is a free agent, if no undue pressure is brought to bear upon him, not one single landlord will accept stock at the price offered in this Bill.<lb/>
I believe that this Bill is going to relieve the Treasury a great deal more than is thought, because it is going to confer upon them the obligation to produce only
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0294"/>
<col>575</col>
&#x00A3;2,000,000 in cash and &#x00A3;2,000,000 a year in stock. That there are landlords ready to take as much as &#x00A3;2,000,000 of stock in a year I myself believe is a hope that is almost a waste of time to discuss, and, if it is, the Treasury are going to find themselves in the happy position of having to produce less than &#x00A3;4,000,000 a year in cash, whereas hitherto they have had to produce &#x00A3;5,000,000 and sometimes &#x00A3;6,000,000 in cash. Note the result of that. Instead of getting rid of purchase agreements at the rate of &#x00A3;5,000,000 and &#x00A3;6,000,000 a year you are going to get rid of them at the rate of &#x00A3;2,000,000 or &#x00A3;3,000,000 a year, and the &#x00A3;50,000,000 now outstanding are going to take sixteen or twenty years to clear off. It is difficult to realise, unless I am an extremely pessimistic prophet, how the provisions of this Bill are going to help to get rid of this block that everybody admits is an evil.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord St David's, referred yesterday to another aspect of this question. I do not wish to follow him in detail as to his attacks upon my noble friends on this side of the House regarding the provision of the bonus. The noble Lord described the bonus as a gift which noble Lords on this side of the House gave to their political friends in Ireland, and he had previously explained what he meant by that statement. He seemed to imagine that the bonus was something extra that the landlord got after he had agreed upon the price of the land with his tenant. Of course anybody who has ever negotiated with a single tenant knows that the fact that the bonus was there made it possible for landlords to agree to prices considerably lower than they would have had to have asked if there had been no bonus, and considerably lower than they would have had to ask under this Bill. I do not wish to quarrel with the noble Lord, Lord St. David's, as to anything he said about Irish land, because I do not think he would pose as an expert on Irish land. But I do recognise him as an authority in the realm of finance. The noble Lord made it quite clear that stock, whether this Bill passes or not, but principally if this Bill passes in its present form, is not going to rise. We are not going to see Irish Land Stock at ninety-two or anything like it for many years to come. One may say, in passing, it has not been at ninety-two since the year 1906. If the price, therefore, is not likely to rise, are you quite sure it is not likely to go down? You assume at present that landlords will take stock at
<col>576</col>
ninety-two which is worth eighty-five, but, as we have been shown, the number of trustee securities on the market is increasing. Are you quite sure that this stock is not going down? Do the Government really think, supposing this stock went down to seventy-eight, that landlords would still take it at ninety-two? Do you think they would assist you to get rid of the block by making a still greater sacrifice? I almost feel inclined to prophesy that we shall have this fall, and that five or six years hence we shall have another block, and we shall have slower progress than we are having now. We shall then have another Land Bill, and I am sure we shall have another eloquent speech from the noble Earl who leads the House in which he will tell us as he told us yesterday, that he wishes to avoid all recrimination, as he did avoid all recrimination, but that it is not unfair to say that the finance of the Act of 1909 was a little hopeful; thereupon another request will be made to the landlords and tenants of Ireland to take over a little more of the loss that the British Treasury does not like to incur. That may be very satisfactory to the British Treasury, as this Bill, I have no doubt, is very satisfactory, but it will not be much encouragement to those of us who desire to see the progress and the pacification of Ireland as a result of land purchase.<lb/>
I want to refer very shortly to a point that has been made a very great deal of by Government speakers which I think has not been answered as yet from these Benches. A great deal is being made of the liberality of the British taxpayer in this matter. I do not wish to deny the liberality of the British taxpayer, and I do not wish to quarrel with the figures of the Lord Chancellor, but I think he was a little inclined to treat this whole transaction as a dead loss. I quite agree that the bonus provisions are going to be a dead loss, but the money that has been advanced outside the bonus provision is, we are told, going to be paid back to the last penny, and everything points to every penny of it being paid back.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0003P0I0295"/>
<col>577</col>
taxpayer something, he is paying for his sins of the past. The object of land purchase is to get rid of dual ownership, and dual ownership was the mistake of a British Parliament in 1881. It is not the result of any indigenous growth in the Irish land system itself. But apart from that, I want to lay greater stress upon another aspect of the problem that I think is always forgotten in this matter. I know it is difficult to get money for financing these transactions because of the fall in Imperial credit. But if this reason causes difficulty to the British Treasury we must remember that also, as apart from Irish land, this reason has caused a considerable profit to the British Treasury. While it is difficult to raise money for Irish land with land stock at eighty-five, the Treasury is all the time redeeming Consols at eighty-two by the operation of the Sinking Fund. It would, I have no doubt, be scouted at the Treasury that the large profit made over the redemption of Consols should be in any way accounted as against the large loss made by reason of the Irish Land Stock, but it is not unfair to lay stress upon that point in commenting upon the general financial situation.<lb/>
I will not at this late hour enter into the question of the Government estimate of &#x00A3;180,000,000. I believe that estimate to be hugely inflated and above the real necessities of the case, but perhaps I may be allowed to say this. Remember that the ideal as shown in the Bill is very different from the ideal of the Wyndham Act. The object of that Act was the abolition of dual ownership. The present Chief Secretary seems to work on the principle that, if anybody has any land at all, that fact is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the land ought to belong to somebody else. There are only 20,000,000 acres of agricultural land in Ireland, and that, under the census returns, includes land used for countless purposes, not strictly agricultural. Mr. Birrell estimates that 19,000,000 of this has got to come under the operations of the Purchase Act. I am perfectly certain the abolition of dual ownership would not have made it necessary for anything like that number of acres to be considered. Again, as judged by the Bill, there can be no denying the fact that the problem financially has been enormously increased by what it is now proposed should be done for the landless men. Under the 1903 Act it was solely intended that landless men should be dealt
<col>578</col>
with as ancillary to the doing away with dual ownership. This Bill, as I read it&#x2014;I have no special knowledge of the intention of the Government behind the Bill&#x2014;makes provision for landless men a primary object. I believe that if the landless men were excluded, as they ought to be, for they have no claim whatever on the British Treasury to set them up with land, Mr. Wyndham's original estimate, though it might not have been large enough, would have been very much nearer the mark than Mr. Birrell's estimate of &#x00A3;180,000,000.<lb/>
I apologise for keeping your Lordships at this hour. Most of the other points I had hoped to refer to can be raised at a later stage when, probably, they will be raised with greater profit. I only desire to enforce one point now, and then I will sit down. I feel very seriously and sincerely the gravity of the present proposals for peace and order and contentment in Ireland. What we should be concerned with in these Purchase Acts is the settlement of the country in a contented manner. Lord Londonderry has explained at length how he believes that the principal result of the passing of this Bill in its present state must inevitably be infinitely greater discontent and more turmoil than we have seen even in the last two or three years under Mr. Birrell's&#x2014;to put it mildly&#x2014;not too keen repression of disorder. The peace and prosperity of the country are vastly greater than any other interest that can be considered by your Lordships, and believing, as I do, that this Bill if passed in its present form would be fatal to those interests, I most sincerely hope that the Bill will be very substantially amended in Committee if it is afterwards to be read a third time and passed by your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01621"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry that, owing to the absence from unavoidable causes, of some of my noble friends who sit on this side of the House, these Benches have not been so fully represented in the debate as they would otherwise have been. We are relieved to know that your Lordships do not intend to support the Amendment of Lord Dunraven. I rise to say a few words, which I will compress into as short a space as possible, to close the debate, and I will endeavour to deal generally with one or two points that have been raised in the course of it.<lb/>
The whole case against the finance of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0296"/>
<col>579</col>
the Bill was put as well as it could be put by the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven. He took the matter on the highest ground. He assumed that there was an absolute bargain or promise on the part of the British Parliament that, however large might be the sum to be raised in respect of land purchase in Ireland, however gross the miscalculation contained in the Act of 1903, equally favourable terms, whatever the cost to the Treasury and the United Kingdom, should be carried into effect, and with the somewhat significant exception of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, who certainly did not take that line of policy, and of a few sentences which fell from the noble Earl who has just sat down towards the close of his speech, the same note has run through all the speeches that have been made from the Benches opposite during the course of the debate. I think it is rather a good thing that a speech was made such as was made by Lord St. David's. I do not adopt all his arguments, and I do not profess to be an unbiassed critic. I have a warm affection for Ireland, dating from even before my official connection with the country, and I like to see Ireland absorbing public money within reason. But I think it is not a bad thing that noble Lords from Ireland should hear what is the view of an Englishman of business like Lord St. David's as to these transactions when we hear speech after speech made in which there is not a word of recognition of the enormous cost at which these transactions in the Bill are to be carried through.<lb/>
I think if Irishmen, whether landlords or tenants, take up the position that the taxpayer of the United Kingdom is a sort of tame and rather stupid mulch cow who stands to be milked twice a day for their benefit, they must not be surprised if they hear somewhat hard words used by those who have no special sympathy with Ireland. I was very sorry the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, who is more an Englishman than an Irishman, seemed to take something of the same tone and to adopt what I may call the full Irish attitude in this matter. No more signal instance in that attitude has been seen on the opposite side of the House than the way in which the burden upon the guarantee fund has been spoken of throughout the debate, as though it was not a genuine section under under the Act of 1903 as much as any
<col>580</col>
other. I think it was Lord Curzon who said it had been inserted <i>per incuriam.</i> We have heard in private life of gentlemen who have written their name on bills <i>per incuriam</i> and been sadly shocked afterwards when they had been called upon to pay. But I think your Lordships will admit it ought not to appear as an excuse for the insertion of the clause in the Bill. It is true, as was said, that almost the only voice of Cassandra which was raised in the course of debate in another place was that of a gentleman well known for his knowledge of finance, Mr. Thomas Bowles. Who can say that if the House of Commons at large had taken the view of Mr. Bowles they would have passed that Act in its present form? It is impossible, of course, to prove it one way or the other, but when you talk of this being a mere paper guarantee it is fair to consider that, if the great majority who were wrong had happened to agree with Mr. Thomas Bowles who was right, perhaps the provisions of the Act would have been different. It is quite possible the tenants might have had to pay larger annuity, and consequently the number of years purchase obtained by landlords during the past six years might not have been as many as they have been.<lb/>
There are one or two other points on which I desire to say a word. My noble and learned friend who sits upon the Woolsack dealt, I think fully, with the question of compulsion. I noticed that speakers on the other side all through the debate said the Estates Commissioners could take land when they pleased. They did not trouble to mention the fact that there was an appeal to the Judicial Commissioner with assessors. That is a somewhat material fact. I might say, in passing, that the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, seemed to think the Estates Commissioners were a creation of this Bill. He spoke of them as "these new Estates Commissioners." I do not know whether he has ever read the Act of 1903, but he seemed to consider the Estates Commissioners were a body of our creation. It is curious that one of the phrases used in regard to the compulsory clauses should have caused so much comment as it has from noble Lords opposite&#x2014;the phrase in regard to the provision that the amount which the tenants or other person would be likely to give would be taken into account. I do not see how you can have any form of compulsory purchase without
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0297"/>
<col>581</col>
taking into account what a willing buyer would be likely to give. It seems to me a natural element in the transaction, and I think it is not necessary to read into it the somewhat sinister meaning which has been ascribed to it by noble Lords opposite. As regards the whole of this question of compulsion, noble Lords opposite say it is impossible to have compulsion and voluntary purchase running concurrently. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack put that dictum into its proper form when he said they could not run concurrently in competition. That is perfectly true. But they do run concurrently, as your Lordships know very well, in a series of transactions with which we are all familiar. A great many of your Lordships have sold land to railway companies. In the last resort the railway company can get practically any piece of land it wants. But as a matter of fact it is the rarest thing in the world for things to go so far. I am sure Lord Cawdor knows that very well and would bear me out when I say that in the numerous transactions in which a great railway company is concerned every year in connection with the taking of land, the vastly larger proportion is acquired by agreement. That is all that was meant by the weapon of compulsion remaining in the background, the sentence which filled noble Lords with alarm. The power is the same as a railway company has in the last resort of acquiring compulsorily what is wanted for public purposes, a power which enables those transactions to be carried out between railway companies and private owners which I believe are generally satisfactory to both parties.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Oranmore and Browne, asked me whether I would lay down a rule, so far as I am competent, that all grass lands taken by compulsion ought to be bought at twenty years purchase on the average rent which had been obtained by public letting on the eleven months system for the last seven years. I am sure the noble Lord did not expect me to answer that question, although he had no doubt a full right to put it. I cannot recall any precedent for such a provision being inserted in an Act of Parliament. I can-not help thinking, however, that the fears which have been expressed that the price of grass land will be unscrupulously cut down are not justified. It is true there are certain considerations to be taken into account in determining the number of
<col>582</col>
years purchase which ought to be paid for any piece of land or indeed anything else, whether it is sold by compulsion or by agreement. The degree of certainty with which you can look forward to the permanency of the rent which you are receiving is a material factor in a matter of this kind. As I daresay the noble Lord knows very well, when royalty rents of mines are put up for auction, even though the mine, apparently, is going to last for a great number of years, they can hardly be made to realise more than half the number of years purchase which ground rents would effect, and so far as any element of uncertainty enters into the letting of grazing land, no doubt it would have, and I submit ought to have, seine effect on the member of years purchase to be given.<lb/>
Now, my Lords one word about zones. Noble Lords have gone on reiterating, with a persistence which I admire, that we are trying to abolish zones. I think my noble friend on the Woolsack made it clear what it is we desire to do with the zones. Perhaps I might make one more attempt by illustration to do it again. The effect of land purchase is to divorce the landlord from the land, and divorce, as we know, is a process of law. But collusive divorce is forbidden, and there is an official whose business it is to find out if divorce is collusively obtained. The Estates Commissioners for this particular purpose, are placed therefore in the position of the King's Proctor, who has to intervene if he conceives that the legal process is being carried tint by improper collusion. Beyond that, as regards the zones, we do not go. The matter was fully developed by my noble and learned friend, and I will not dwell upon it further.<lb/>
One word about the problem of congestion and its bearing on the question, to a certain extent, of compulsory purchase and the question of the landless men. In his speech yesterday the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition broke into something almost approaching rhapsody when he spoke of some parts at any rate of the congested districts in Ireland. He said, which I am not concerned to deny, that it is possible to overstate the magnitude of the problem and of the grievance, and he pointed out, what is perfectly true, that if you take a year or two before the great
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0298"/>
<col>583</col>
famine and compare the number and size of the holdings with what obtains to-day the comparison is all in favour of the present time. That there has been a real and progressive improvement we all of us, I think, would admit. Rut I do think the noble Marquess overstated his case a little when he dwelt upon the charms of the small holdings in the west of Ireland. I felt almost alarmed that some of the noble Marquess's Wiltshire small tenants, whom I know to be both unusually numerous and unusually prosperous on an admirably managed estate, might be so inspired by the noble Marguess's description of holdings in the west of Ireland that they might turn their faces to the setting sun and desire to exchange their English home for other homes in County Kerry. But, my Lords, however that may be, and I do admit that there is a real improvement, yet, at the same time, there is a real problem, the problem of what is to be done to secure larger holdings, or, in some cases, other holdings, for a certain portion of those who live in the congested districts and cannot eke out their small means by other work such as fishing.<lb/>
Consider this in its bearing, in the first place, on compulsory purchase. So far as I have been able, I have followed through the various speeches the different steps of the argument which I conceive to be used by noble Lords opposite, and what I desire to show is that it is barren and leads absolutely nowhere. Those steps are these. The argument against compulsion is that there is plenty of land to be got somewhere&#x2014;that argument was freelyused&#x2014;and therefore that there being plenty of land to be got there was no need to buy it forcibly. Well the conclusion to be drawn from that is, of course, that a general system of migration must be necessary, because the principal need of compulsion, as has often been pointed out, is not to get land anywhere but to get particular land in the immediate neighbourhood of the people for whom it is required. Then there is a further statement laid down forcibly by Lord Ashbourne and confirmed by other speakers that under no circumstances is a landless man to have any land. What is the result of that? It is generally agreed that, unfortunate though you may think it, there is a large body of these landless men who desire to obtain some farm. We have been told over and over again&#x2014;we were told yesterday&#x2014;that if congests
<col>584</col>
attempted to appear on untenanted land at any distance from their own neighbourhood there would be extraordinary danger. I am bound to say I am inclined to agree with the view, that, unless you can arrive at some agreement in the matter, if you dumped down a number of men from Connemara in County Clare their lives might be exciting but they might also be brief.<lb/>
Where are we in that case? You must not take land close to those congests' homes because you might have to take it by compulsion. Therefore you have to migrate. But if you migrate then you run up against the landless men. It is all very well to say you can protect your migrating bodies, but everybody will agree that that makes the proposition of migration on a large scale impossible. It is, of course, the duty of the Government in Ireland to protect, sometimes for twenty years it may be, the lives of those who are supposed to be in danger. But it would be a farcical proceeding to deport people from a place where they are safe and set them in a position where they will have to be guarded for an indefinite number of years by police. That means that migration transactions are impossible. That is to say, you are left with no remedy at all for the relief of congestion. I have wearied your Lordships by indicating the series of steps, but the only conclusion I can arrive at is that the whole problem of the remedy of congestion is regarded by noble Lords opposite as completely insoluble, because at every point we are met by one or other of these objections.<lb/>
I think it would be a pity if I were to attempt to detain the House any longer at this, for us unusually late hour. I merely desire to comment on one statement made by Lord Donoughmore, who was good enough to speak of the Amendments he assumed we were going to introduce and which he said he desired to see. I did not gather from the speech of my noble and learned friend that he said the Government were going to introduce Amendments. Lord Donoughmore, though he spoke of his limited experience, knows the House as well as any man, and what the Government have done is what is frequently done from this side of the House&#x2014;that is, we have expressed ourselves desirous to meet certain objections if noble Lords would indicate the manner in which
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0299"/>
<col>585</col>
they wished the clauses to be amended. The noble Earl was quite right when he said that he never knew a case in which the Government, having conceived a Bill, proceeded to amend it. We have no intention of doing anything of the kind. The Bill as it stands is our Bill, but we admit that there are clauses which are widely drawn and where it would be possible if the Estates Commissioners were to behave in an absolutely reckless way for the principles in those clauses to be carried further than is our desire or intention. That both my noble and learned friend and I have admitted. Noble Lords wish to see the words narrowed and we profess our willingness to meet them on that point, and I have no doubt when the time comes in Committee by putting our heads together we shall be able on one or two of these points to arrive at a conclusion which will not be unsatisfactory to one side of the House or the other.<lb/>
I have nothing further to add except once more to repeat that, although I do not admit that the time given to this Bill in another place was in itself insufficient, I fully agree that there is no reason why we should not, and every reason why we should, give it the fullest consideration here in Committee. I was made a little nervous by my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack when he indicated what an imitation of the proceedings in another place would involve here. I am afraid it would involve longer consideration than any Bill has received in your Lordships House for the last 600 years, except the Education Bill of 1906 of deplorable memory. Of course, we must leave it to your Lordships to put down such Amendments as you please, and we will, of course, see so far as we can that they have the fullest consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01622"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: I gather from this interesting debate that with, I think, the exception of four noble Lords, your Lordships are all of opinion that though this Bill is an exceedingly bad Bill it ought to be read a second time. Under those circumstances I have, of course, no desire to press my Amendment, and that being so I should be only wasting the time of your Lordships unnecessarily if I were to traverse, or attempt to traverse, any of the arguments that have been advanced in favour of the Bill, that is supposing I could discover any. Nor would I attempt
<col>586</col>
to do what would be much more difficult, and ask your Lordships to try and harden your hearts against the sweet persuasiveness of the Lord Chancellor. There are only two points I should like to mention; they are not really important points, but they might lead to misunderstanding. One is in connection with Clause 17. Lord Granard attributed to me an objection to subsection (<i>e</i>) of that clause. As a matter of fact I do not think I mentioned the subsection at all in my speech. As any rate, what I do object to is not subsection (<i>e</i>), which I could agree to, but subsection (<i>b</i>). So far as I am concerned, subsection (<i>e</i>) is quite satisfactory. It is subsection (<i>b</i>) which to my mind is dangerous as introducing the landless men.<lb/>
The only other observation I would make is in reference to the very interesting speech we heard from Lord St. David's. The noble Earl the Leader of the House has alluded to it as a wholesome tonic and as a speech from which we can learn what the commonsense businesslike Englishman thinks of the finance of the Irish Land Bill; but I would point out that the noble Lord, Lord St. David's, was mistaken as to his facts. In the first place he spoke purely and merely of the English taxpayer, he being apparently under the delusion&#x2014;I am very sorry to say it is a delusion&#x2014;that the people of Ireland pay no taxes. On the contrary, they pay taxes which they think press unduly upon them according to their relative capacity to bear taxation. The noble Lord said British taxpayers made the whole advance without any margin. Of course they make the whole advance, but there is a very good margin, as I am sure the noble Earl opposite knows. The advance is made upon the landlord's interest only. The value of the landlord's interest can be best computed by the judicial rent, and there is a margin of about twenty-five per cent. on that alone. Besides that, the whole holding forms, of course, the security, and the tenant's interest is worth as much as the landlord's, so that there is really a margin of anything between fifty and seventy-five per cent. on the transaction. Moreover, Lord St. David's was unaware, I think, that any default on the annuity is a charge upon the whole county rates, and therefore not only is the capital well secured but the interest also. I think probably if the noble
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0300"/>
<col>587</col>
Lord had known those facts he might perhaps have modified a little the opinion he expressed concerning Irish land.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I think that is all I wish to say. Of course I do not press my Amendment. The general opinion of your Lordships is that this Bill can be so amended as to be made a workable measure. Naturally I was much impressed by what fell from the lips of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and by what fell from Lord MacDonnell, who gave it as his opinion that the Bill could be made a beneficient measure. With all my heart, my Lords, I hope so, and I confess I am rather cheered and consoled by the speech of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. If he will allow me to epitomise it, it was to the effect that the real
<col>588</col>
intentions of His Majesty's Government as expressed in this House are absolutely different from the intentions of His Majesty's Government as expressed in the Bill. I could not have foreseen that when I made my speech asking the House to reject the Bill. But that being so, I am not myself without hope that possibly the Bill may be made into a workable measure. With the leave of the House I will withdraw the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01629"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD O'HAGAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I think I may be expected to explain as briefly as possible the objects for which the measure is introduced. The object of the Bill is to empower the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland to undertake prosecutions for the punishment of offences under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, in cases which relate to Irish agriculture and other Irish industries. In England the Board of Agriculture has powers to undertake similar prosecutions as these, but in Ireland, as the law stands at present, these prosecutions have to be undertaken by the Board of Trade. As your Lordships are aware, the Irish Department of Agriculture possesses extensive powers for aiding agriculture and other Irish industries, and is in touch with persons carrying on such industries. It has, therefore, been thought desirable that the Department should have the same powers of taking proceedings in case of offences which seriously injure the development of those industries as possessed by the English Board. The offences consist generally of selling goods under false trade marks, and the Bill provides that the prosecutions are
<col>590</col>
to be undertaken in accordance with the regulations of the Lord Chancellor for Ireland, and with the consent of the Board of Trade. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01633">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01634"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD O'HAGAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is to amend the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1901, and it proposes to facilitate the carrying out of the law. As the law stands at present, the expenses of an application for a change of the close season, and all the proceedings consequent thereon, have to be defrayed by the person or persons who make the application. There is a great objection to the enforcement of this section of the previous Act, as it practically precludes the poorer class of fishermen from making any application of the kind. It has also been found difficult to estimate exactly the costs of the applications and the expenses involved. For at least forty years and probably longer, the fishery authorities in Ireland have, however, charged all expenses under this heading to the Parliamentary vote, but in the year 1895 objection was raised in the House of Commons to this practice, and the effect of that objection has been that no change in the close season in any respect has been made since that date, although numerous applications for such alterations have been received. Under the present Bill the Department hope to remove the difficulties that I have referred to by providing for the payment of expenses incurred by them in connection with applications for the purpose I have indicated out of moneys provided by Parliament. This will enable the law to be carried out in this respect on the same lines as it has been carried out in former years. I think your Lordships will agree that this is a measure that deserves considerable support, as it will, I believe, remove a cause of grievance to the poorer fishermen of Ireland, and will enable these alterations to

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01636"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to say anything against the Second Reading of this Bill, but I noticed that when the measure was in another place there was a section in the Bill giving power for the catching of salmon for the purpose of spawning, and with the object of using the eggs of the salmon for breeding purposes in proper piscatorial establishments. I can only say there is a feeling amongst certain people in Ireland that this proviso would have been made use of in an improper manner, because this salmon would have been taken in the close season. But I feel myself that it was a very important proviso, and I regret very much that in another place it was taken out. I hope that in the next session, or the following session, such a proviso may be entertained in a Bill of this sort, because I think it was rather straining a point to say that there might be poaching, so to speak, of these salmon when they would be really taken for the improvement of the fishery, and also for scientific purposes. As I said, I do not wish to oppose the Second Reading, because I think the Bill is a most useful one.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01640"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD O'HAGAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the case for this Bill is generally admitted, and I cannot help feeling that all those who hope and look for an improvement in Irish agriculture will welcome the objects for which the Bill is framed. The first part of the Bill deals with the question of noxious weeds, and the object is to check as far as may be the growth of these weeds, and, naturally, as a result of this, to protect those industrious and careful farmers who do their utmost to keep their lands in a clean condition, and who are bound to suffer from the thistle-down and other seeds which are blown from the lands of farmers who are not so careful in dealing with weeds. It is quite unnecessary for me, especially in your Lordships' House, to talk of the evils
<col>592</col>
which accrue to any holding where weeds of the description mentioned in the Bill are allowed to grow in any quantity, or to point out the injury done to those who have the misfortune to have properties or holdings next to those who keep their land in the condition to which I have just referred. Under Part I of the Bill the Department of Agriculture seek for powers, with the county councils's consent, when satisfied that such a state of things exists as I have already alluded to, to compel the occupier to cut down or destroy the weeds in question. If the notices of the Department are not complied with, there is a penalty attached&#x2014;namely, &#x00A3;5 for the first offence, and &#x00A3;10 for the second or any subsequent offence. I do not think I need go into the question of precedents for a measure of this sort, but there has been legislation in the Isle of Man, Canada, South Africa, Australia, the United States and, in Germany. Part II of the Bill deals with the question of seeds. As your Lordships are aware, the Department in 1901 introduced a seed testing station, and the value of this station has been fully shown by the advantage that has been taken of it by numerous farmers. The Department have found, as a result of the tests that they have been asked to make, that there is a very large amount of bad, seed sold to the small farmers more especially in their dealings with small shopkeepers. As your Lordships are aware the farmers in Ireland are protected, to some extent with regard to their manure and feeding stuffs by the Fertilisers and Food Stuffs Act of 1906, and your Lordships will fully realise that the question of the condition of the seeds that are employed is at least as of great importance as that of the manures and feeding stuffs. Under this Bill the power that the Department of Agriculture seek to take is merely that of examining samples of the seeds that are for sale, and they hope that by the knowledge that such examinations may take place, and also by the powers they seek for bringing this matter before the public where they think necessary, they may make some steps towards remedying the existing state of things. As your Lordship will see, the general effect of this Bill will be to make the work of the Department more effective, and, as I think, to supplement much of the good work that has already been done. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

I would, therefore, ask the noble Lord who has charge of the Bill either to postpone the Second Reading until after the House has dealt with the important Scottish Bill on the Paper, or else to accept from us briefly notice that we cannot consent to passing this Bill into law exactly in its present state. There are some most important safeguards that we desire to see inserted, and the noble Lord in his speech has very much indicated the lines on which we wish to proceed. He has mentioned a case where a man has taken pains to keep his lands clean and has to suffer for the neglect of his neighbour who will not cut his weeds. But what we all desire to secure is that the farmer who does honestly cut or destroy his weeds within the meaning of the provisions of this Bill shall not be liable to vexatious prosecutions which he will be open to if this Bill passes in its present form. I would, therefore, ask the noble Lord to say whether he will either postpone the Second Reading or accept my few words as a notice that we must deal with this matter seriously in Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01644"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONCURRY</member><membercontribution>: After what has fallen from my noble friend I may say that those of us who take an interest in national emblems are surprised that Scotland should not have the benefit of this Bill, which deals mainly with the subject of thistles. There is another allusion I should like to make with regard to Scotland. Many of your Lordships have passed through the glens and straths of that country, and probably have seen the large grazing farms. Surely in those places there must be ragworts and thistles growing. The same occurs in Ireland. But under this Bill every holder of a grazing farm would be liable to have one of these inspectors popping down upon him and bringing him before the court for allowing thistles to grow upon his land. I say that there should be some provision to prevent these itinerant
<col>594</col>
inspectors from starting prosecutions, or persecutions as they may well be, against the holders of grazing farms. Many of these graziers have a fear of this, and some of them have written asking me to bring this matter before the House, because they fear the Bill may be used as an engine of persecution against them, as they have been used to treatment of the same sort before. All I desire is to alter the Bill so that the man who honestly cuts down or destroys his weeds within the meaning of the Act shall not be liable to these vexatious prosecutions.</membercontribution></p>

ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no right to say anything on the application of this Bill to Ireland, and I have no doubt the suggestion of the noble Lord who has just spoken has a great deal to be said in its favour. But I rise to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture for England why it should not be possible to apply something of this kind to England? We have weeds in England which do harm to neighbouring farms, and why the first and second clauses of this Bill so far as they enable the Department to frame a list of noxious weeds and impose a penalty on an occupier if these weeds are not properly kept cut should not also be enacted for England I do not understand. May I ask the noble Earl whether he can hold out any hope that, at any rate so far as this Bill can be made applicable to England, he will favourably consider Amendments in Committee? I know one chamber of agriculture in my own county who would desire this to be done.</membercontribution></p>

I will not fail to lay to heart the words of advice I have received, and I will make at once prompt inquiries as to whether there is any reason why this Bill should not be applied to England. Speaking for myself alone, I hope that I shall be able to follow the advice given from the other side, and that we may be able to include England and Scotland as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01647"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been my fortune or misfortune to sit upon a great many Committees. I
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0304"/>
<col>595</col>
recollect some years ago I was Chairman of a Committee which inquired into and reported upon this very subject with regard to England&#x2014;I am not sure of the date, but it must be about ten years ago. I have often seen comments that nothing was ever done by the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;I admit I was myself to blame to some extent, because for a time I held the honourable position now occupied by the noble Earl opposite&#x2014;that we never did anything to carry out the Report of that Committee. Now when His Majesty's Government introduce a Bill dealing with this subject in this House it does seem to me a little strange that they should not have endeavoured when occasion arose to give effect to the recommendations of that Committee. I am bound to say I do not carry in my mind exactly what recommendations we made, but we certainly recommended that a Government testing station should be erected, and that all seeds should be brought there and tested either free or at a very low charge. That seems to be the purport of Part II of this Bill. I am not sure that I agree with my noble friend Lord Cloncurry that we should all like to see Section 2 applied to England, so that any one might serve a notice upon us requiring us to cut down and destroy those botanical growths which the Board of Agriculture might choose to describe as weeds; but I think, as far as the power of having seeds tested by a farmer is concerned, that is an advantage which ought not to be confined to Irish agriculturists alone. I hope between this and the Committee stage, when the noble Earl is considering the matter, he will at least see whether the same facilities for testing seeds cannot be extended to the English farmer in the same way that this Bill proposes to extend them to the Irish farmer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01648"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as coming from the west of Ireland I wish to state that while I agree with those who say that this Bill should not be made an engine of persecution to fall upon the unfortunate grazier, who has enemies enough already, I do submit that it is a measure which is urgently required. Many people who do their best to cut their weeds and thistles suffer from the fact that their neighbours do not do so. I suffer myself a great deal from it. I spend a large sum of money every year on cutting thistles, and yet find my fields sown over with thistles blown from the lands outside. This
<col>596</col>
Bill will be exceedingly useful, care being taken that it should be used legitimately and not for the purpose of oppression. I hope if the Bill passes that the inspectors of the Department will also turn their attention to the public roads, for though the road contractors are bound by law to cut weeds and thistles we find that we often have to drive along between a hedge of thistles on each side, and the seeds are sown all round about. The Bill is required, but great care should be taken in its administration.</membercontribution></p>

Of course, any words that the noble Lords may suggest to deal with the dangers which they anticipate will receive every attention at the hands of the Irish Department, but as I have slid, I think those are matters that can be dealt with in a more satisfactory manner in Committee. Under these circumstances I still hope that the Bill may be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01652">Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Pentland.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01653"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill came on for Second Reading very late at night, and insufficient opportunity was afforded for discussing it. Therefore if your Lordships will allow me to say a few words I think I can explain exactly what our position is with regard to this Bill to-night. I can point out to your Lordships the part of the Bill which is not objected to, and which, therefore, we shall not have occasion to discuss, or, at all events, to have any difference of opinion upon. On the other hand, I can point out the part of the Bill which is objected to. The essence of this Bill is contained in Clauses 4, 6, and 18. The purpose of the Bill is to increase the number of short lets, and to prevent it being any
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0305"/>
<col>597</col>
longer necessary for a tenant who is going to occupy a house to give a very long notice that he is going to do so before that tenancy commences. Your Lordships will find, if you look at Clause 4, that&#x2014;
<quote>"No agreement, whether verbal or written, for the let of a small dwelling-house shall be binding if the same has been made more than two months prior to the date of entry to such dwelling-house."</quote>
There is no objection to that. The next is Clause 6, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"Either the owner or the occupier may give notice of removal with a view to terminate any tenancy of a small dwelling-house on the day upon which the next payment of rent falls due."</quote>
That is subject to certain notices which are afterwards detailed and which are necessary in order to be clear. Under that clause it will no longer be possible for any house-owner or tenant to make with certainty a let for a year. That is to say, either of them will be able, under Clause 6, if the tenant has taken a house for a year on, we will say, monthly payments of rent, to give notice at the next monthly payment, supposing the notice is sufficient in other terms of the clause. That, of course, is a great change in the existing law. That is the real object of this Bill, and to that also there is no objection&#x2014;at least, no objection is going to be taken in Parliament. It is quite true that some of the burghs, and particularly some of the smaller burghs, think this Bill is altogether unnecessary. Their population not being migratory, and their business being tolerably steady in quantity, the tenants prefer to hold and to take houses for a year. But, of course, in Glasgow and places where trade fluctuates, it is not so. The other clause is Clause 18, and that says&#x2014;
<quote>"All bedding material as well as all tools and implements of trade used or to be used by the occupier of a small dwelling-house or any member of his family, as the means of his, her, or their livelihood, which are in the dwelling-house, and furniture and plenishing in a small dwelling-house to the value according to the sheriff officer's inventory, of ten pounds, shall be wholly exempt from the right of hypothec of the landlord."</quote>
To that also there is no objection, and in those three clauses combined is the essence of the Bill. Therefore your Lordships will see that no objection will be taken to those, but what will be really objected to are the clauses which by way of description I will call the rating clauses. These are Clause 2&#x2014;on which my noble friend Lord Clinton has an Amendment&#x2014;and
<col>598</col>
Clauses 12 to 17, which are known as the compounding clauses. Of course, as they stand, they extend very largely the system of compounding rates. Your Lordships will, therefore, see the points which, when we go into Committee, we shall have to discuss.<lb/>
One word with regard to the history of this Bill. When we were on the Second Reading I put several questions to the noble Lord, but I was not sufficiently fortunate then to obtain much of an answer. I hope on this occasion I may be more fortunate. This Bill as originally introduced applied to houses up to &#x00A3;15 of rent and was optional. It went up to Grand Committee, and at a certain stage was entirely transmogrified by a new definition and a new clause introduced by the Lord Advocate. It was made compulsory on all burghs except those with a population of under 10,000, and the figure which had stood at &#x00A3;15 was raised to &#x00A3;21 and &#x00A3;26. I want to know the reason why this change was made. In the House of Commons up to the present time they have received no explanation whatever as to why and at whose instance the Bill was altered, because it is no longer the same Bill. I ask, Was it altered at the instance of the burghs? There are 205 burghs, and of course there are 205 interests, and I am not aware that they were consulted about this enormous change in any way whatsoever. What we are told is that one or two Members of Parliament suggested the change, and on their suggestion it was made. I want to know whether that was the case, and whether these burghs had an opportunity of representing their objections. I cannot think they had. But there was one thing which was more surprising than this, for when I asked the noble Lord whether he was aware that there was objection to his Bill on the part of the burghs, he said he was not aware. At that moment I will undertake to say there was not a single Scottish Peer in this House who had not received letters and applications and memoranda from a number of burghs, and how it can be contended that the Scottish Office alone was ignorant of this passes my comprehension. I can quite understand that so far as the Lord Advocate is concerned he might be ignorant, because the business of the Lord Advocate at the present time appears to be going about the country advocating the most Socialistic doctrines, such as land nationalisation, and we do not
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0306"/>
<col>599</col>
even know whether he is an emissary of His Majesty's Government or not, because when the noble Earl the Leader of the House was asked whether he agreed with these doctrines, he seemed to me to be in a much greater dilemma than I have seen him in since he has led this House. He shrugged his shoulders, smiled, and said nothing. So much for the Lord Advocate; he might be otherwise occupied, but the noble Lord is not otherwise occupied, and he surely must have known&#x2014;I cannot understand how he did not know&#x2014;that the burghs objected to this.<lb/>
Let me give a few of the names of the people who have applied to me&#x2014;the City of Edinburgh, the Convention of Royal Burghs, Aberdeen, Perth, Dunfermline, Ayr, Paisley, Forfar, Musselburgh, Partick, and Hamilton. I presented to your Lordships a Petition from the City of Edinburgh against the Bill, and I take this opportunity of presenting a similar Petition from Musselburgh. But that was not all, because the Convention of Royal Burghs issued a circular letter to all the boroughs&#x2014;they gave them very short notice&#x2014;asking them to express their opinions about the Bill; and it was condemned by the whole of them, including among others, Hamilton, Port Glasgow, Denny, Lanark, and Rothesay. I saw those replies, and so far as I could see there was not a single answer in which the Bill as altered was favourably received. How it was that the noble Lord never heard of one of these I cannot understand, and I hope he will kindly tell us whether before this change was made any effort or attempt was made to ascertain what the feelings of the burghs who are affected were on this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01655"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Let me tell the noble Lord. I asked him on Second Reading whether he was aware of these objections and he said he was not aware that

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01661"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will kindly show to me the precise paper or the precise criticisms which have been handed to him, I will gladly inform him of the date on which those criticisms arrived at the Scottish Office. I am perfectly willing to make known to him, so far as it is for his convenience that I should do so, when the communications arrived at the Scottish Office. On the other hand, I, think you will agree with me that it is for a Minister on his own responsibility to consider representations that are made to him from those interested in legislation over which he has charge, and though the noble Earl has made this complaint, against me to-day, and I regret he should find cause to make it as I endeavour to discharge my duty to the best of my ability, I am bound to tell your Lordships that the same complaint has not reached me from any of the local authorities concerned. There has been no complaint that I have heard that their representations have not been duly considered at the Scottish Office, or that that Office does not welcome any opportunity of ascertaining their views. If that is the case, and if there is complete harmony on that point between myself and the local authorities, I cannot see, with the greatest respect, that the charge which the noble Earl has brought against me to-day is really of any serious weight. Therefore, with your Lordships' permission I pass from that point.<lb/>
The noble Earl went on with some criticisms of the Lord Advocate which, I think,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0307"/>
<col>601</col>
has very little to do with the matter before the House. The Lord Advocate, of course, was the Minister in charge of this Bill in another place, and I am not aware that on any day when it was his business to conduct this Bill, either in Grand Committee or the House of Commons or the Scottish Office, that he was absent from his duties, as the noble Earl is good enough to suggest. The Lord Advocate is not here to speak for himself; therefore I am bound to make this protest on behalf of my learned friend who, in every possible degree, is most assiduous and diligent in the exercise and discharge of his duties. He was in charge of the Bill in the House of Commons, and was responsible for the change in the Bill to which the noble Earl objects. The noble Earl seems to think that this was a surreptitious change. I shall not endeavour to disabuse his mind on that ground. The clause fixing the limits of rent to which the noble Earl takes objection and criticises was brought up before the Grand Committee on June 24. Lengthy discussion took place in the presence of the Scottish Committee, which contains every Scottish Member, and therefore by the constitution of that Committee every local authority in Scotland had direct access to it. The clause was considered by that Committee at some length, and with the agreement of the Committee the Lord Advocate postponed its discussion to a later date. It was not taken up again before July 22. Nearly four weeks, therefore, elapsed between the date of its postponement and the date when the Lord Advocate brought up an amended edition of the clause. That edition was arrived at only after the most careful deliberation and consideration by the Lord Advocate, by myself, and by the officials of the Scottish Office. I am only describing the ordinary procedure of a Government Department in such an event. We carefully considered the desirability of amending the clause in that Bill, and after acquainting ourselves, as we deemed right and at, with local and individual opinion as to the whole subject, it was decided that the Lord Advocate should bring forward his amended clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01662"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Did you ask the opinions of the burghs?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01663"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: What does the noble Earl mean? If he means did we address a circular to the burghs, we did not. But we had before us a lengthy and detailed Report of the Committee which sat on this
<col>602</col>
question; we had received representations from nearly every local authority concerned in Scotland; and we took such steps as we deemed right to supplement the information which we had before us. And really, if we did not consult the burghs, and if we therefore acted without information, the loss is our own, but we took, I think, sufficient and all adequate steps to guard against being in any error as to opinion on this subject. I therefore cannot concede the claim which the noble Earl seems to make that he in this matter represents Scotland, and that the Government do not.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01679"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved the first of a series of Amendments having for their object the alteration of the definition of "dwelling-house" so as to make the Bill apply in burghs with less than 20,000 population to houses of a yearly value of &#x00A3;10 or under, instead of &#x00A3;21 as proposed in the Bill; in burghs with a population of 20,000 and upwards, to houses of &#x00A3;15 yearly value, instead of &#x00A3;26, the value proposed in the Bill to apply in burghs with 50,000 population and upwards; and in burghs with a population of 500,000 and upwards to houses of a yearly value of &#x00A3;20 or under.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01680">He said he had a considerable number of Amendments upon this clause, but they were all put down with exactly the same object, and for convenience he would treat them all as one in this discussion. This particular point had already received some consideration. His object was to alter the definition of "dwelling-house" so that the number of houses and the class of houses might be limited under this Bill. The figures which he had put in his Amendments were practically the same as those which appeared in the Bill when it was first introduced. But what was much more im-
<col>604</col>
portant was that the figures as he proposed them practically represented the considered opinion of, he believed, the whole of the burghs of Scotland. He gathered that the noble Lord was not prepared to accept the Amendments; but this view had been strongly impressed upon some of their Lordships on that side of the House by-the whole of the burghs, and it was the unanimous view of the burghs. The Earl of Camperdown had pointed out where they began to differ on this Bill from the Government, and one of the points was in regard to classification.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01681">He would like their Lordships to consider what was the class of people who really felt the grievance which it was admitted existed owing to the system of long letting of houses. It was entirely that class of working-men who, through the exigencies of their labour, through the class of work they did, and through the unfortunate necessity which so many of them had of constantly moving about in search of employment, that they found it exceedingly difficult and inconvenient to be bound down for a long let. They were anxious to be able to give up their house at short notice. Still more important for his purpose was the class of house which these people required. It was obvious that when a man wanted a house merely for a short period, he would take, if possible, a small and low-rented house. After consultation with the burghs, he had placed in his Amendments those rentals which it was believed entirely covered those whose grievance they wished to remove. Of course, rentals varied and had to vary in the different burghs; they had not chosen their limits in any haphazard way, but after having taken a considerable amount of evidence in the matter; they had sifted it down so as to get at the different classes of the populalation in burghs. He submitted that when they went beyond the limit which he had placed, and went as far as His Majesty's Government suggested, they immediately got to a class of house totally different from the one they were discussing and which was inhabited by a totally different class of occupants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01682">He had a great fear that if they got up to those high rentals, they were, in endeavouring to remove one grievance, exceedingly likely to create another. The Government's limit would include, he believed, something like eighty per cent.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0309"/>
<col>605</col>
of people living in burghs, and it was not right to say that anything approaching that number were people of unstable habits and likely to be wanderers. As a matter of fact, the people who occupied this class of large house were in steady employment and were anxious to look upon their houses as their homes for a definite period, and who quite justly looked forward to a lengthened period of residence. But if their Lordships passed this Bill as it stood now, they would take away from those people altogether the security they had been accustomed to. They would force and condemn them to live under the constant fear of being obliged to break up their home at the bidding of a landlord at any time after forty days notice. That was a grievance which he feared their Lordships would create unless they fairly and properly limited it to the class and brought it down to the sum which he had suggested. His later Amendments he further contended were founded upon the wishes of the burgh and town councils in in this respect. He hoped that the noble Lord would accept from him that absolute fact, that these were the wishes of the people most nearly concerned. He trusted that the noble Lord would not, at all events, put forward any very strong opposition to this Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01683">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line 8, to leave out from the word 'means' to 'a' in line 9."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clinton.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01684"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said he was sorry he could not accept this and the consequential Amendments of the noble Lord. He was not quite sure that the noble Lord fully recognised what was implied in the assertion which he made, that those with whom he had been in communication were to be taken as absolute and unquestioned guides on this subject. The noble Lord would pardon hint for saying that though his acquaintance with such organisations had not been so great as that of the noble Lord, yet he had certainly had in recent years considerable opportunities of making himself fully acquainted with the opinions of the Convention of the Royal Burghs and with various voluntary associations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01685"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> pointed out that these were town councils.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01686"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said he was aware of that, but what the noble Lord had said
<col>606</col>
implied that the authority of the convention on this question was in the first place wholly unanimous, which in this matter it was not; and, in the second place, that it ought to have a higher claim on their Lordships' attention than the elected representatives of constituencies and others, which included these burghs, on such a question as this. He was afraid he could not admit either the one ground or the other.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01687">The reason he could not accept on behalf of the Government what the noble Lord proposed was this. In the first place, this was a labour question pure and simple. It was a grievance which was intensely felt by working-men in Scotland. It was felt by two classes of people&#x2014;in the first place by the class to which the noble Lord alluded, the class who were obliged by the circumstances of their trade to go from place to place. Members of the building trade, the shipbuilding trade, the engineering trade, and the larger trades which had specially large centres in the West of Scotland, were under this disability and felt this grievance exceedingly. But there was another very wide class of people&#x2014;he was not sure that he was correct in calling it a class&#x2014;who also felt very acutely the disability under which they were now living. There were hundreds of cases where a working man might want a larger house, through, possibly, prosperity, an increase in family, or from one cause or another. On the other hand, there were many who, for various reasons, wished to have smaller houses, and desired as soon as possible to escape the liability under which they lay for a large rent. For instance, when the breadwinner was taken away and the widow and children were left, they desired to immediately reduce the scale of their expenses. In every county and burgh in Scotland there were cases of that kind. Therefore, it was not surprising that this grievance should be felt very widely.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01688">Their Lordships might not be aware of the fact, but this grievance was not felt at all in England, where there was a prevailing system of short lets. Scotland was therefore under a disability which was not felt, so far as he was aware, in England. The Scottish people therefore looked to Parliament to place them on an equality in this respect. This was in no sense a Party question. There were no Party politics, as far as he was aware,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0310"/>
<col>607</col>
from the beginning to the end of it. It was not a political question in any sense whatever. The genesis of the question was as he had described it, and came entirely from the grievance he had mentioned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01689">The noble Lord who moved the Amendment had claimed, as he was perfectly entitled to do, that the limits which were placed in the Bill were wrong. His Majesty's Government had considered those limits with the utmost care. The result of the Amendment would be to cut out precisely the better-to-do workmen who were equally the victims of these changes, and who were at least as deserving as those of their fellows who had a smaller income. There are plenty of men working in Glasgow in the building trade&#x2014;plasterers, say&#x2014;getting something like &#x00A3;2 a week. Many of those men, he was informed on reliable authority, paid more than &#x00A3;20 a year rent for their houses. Their Lordships might remember a passage in the Housing Report of the 1885 Royal Commission in which it was suggested that the proper proportion of his income which a man should spend in rent should not exceed one-seventh. They would find also in that Report the lament that workingmen, owing to the high rents of houses, were practically obliged to pay between one-third and one-fourth of their income in rent. He could assure their Lordships who might not be aware of the fact that there were plenty of men in the building and shipbuilding trades who were paying more than &#x00A3;20 a year for their houses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01690">The Amendment of the noble Lord would operate in this way. When the contract for a ship was concluded in Glasgow and the men were discharged, as was so frequently the case, or when a large building was completed and the men had to seek work, possibly under the same contractor in England, or Ireland, or elsewhere in Scotland, the operation of the Amendment must be this: The men who were getting the lower rate of wages, unskilled men, would experience no difficulty, but foremen and. the better-to-do workmen would find themselves shut out from the operation of this Bill. He looked at this purely from the point of view of labour. There was no other concern in it, and he was sure, in adopting the limits which the noble Lord proposed, they would unwittingly and unintentionally be inflicting a hardship on the class of men whom he
<col>608</col>
had indicated. There was no difficulty whatever in practice in continuing the system of yearly lets in Scotland. Whenever a house-owner had a good tenant who was willing to take his house from year to year, there would be no breach of that tenancy. It was quite true there would always be, in the case of houses within the limits of this Bill, the right of the landlord or the tenant to terminate an agreement, but good tenants when they came into contact with a good landlord, and <i>vice vers&#x00E2;,</i> would not part company lightly. Therefore, there would exist the same freedom&#x2014;perhaps he should not say exactly the same freedom, because it might be prejudiced to some slight extent by the possibility of giving short notice granted by the Bill&#x2014;there would exist almost the same freedom for the contracting of yearly lets as there was at present, while within the limits which His Majesty's Government had put in the Bill there would be this great relief to this desirable class of people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01691"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> desired, very briefly, to analyse the answer which the Committee had just received from the noble Lord. His noble friend Lord Clinton proposed that in burghs under 10,000 the limit should be &#x00A3;10; in burghs larger than that it should be &#x00A3;15; and in places like Glasgow, &#x00A3;20. Lord Clinton had said that the great majority of the burghs were in favour of those limits and had so expressed themselves. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland began his reply by questioning this. The noble Lord being in office had greater opportunities of knowing than Lord Clinton could have had, though that did not seem to have been a very great advantage in the present instance. But the Secretary for Scotland said that the noble Lord was mistaken in supposing that these burghs were by any means unanimous. He (Lord Camperdown) had quoted statements which he had received in regard to this matter. First of all, the Convention of Royal Burghs said that the limit ought not to exceed &#x00A3;15. Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Perth, Ayr, Paisley and Hamilton all supported the Convention. Those were the whole of the answers he had received, and he had not the slightest reason to suppose that there was any single burgh which took a different view. But the noble Lord went on from that and said that this was not a question of burghs; it was a question of labour; and the noble
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0311"/>
<col>609</col>
Lord said he had devoted so much attention to the question of labour and he had such intimate means of being in touch with labour that he assured their Lordships that the limits put in the Bill, being the result of great deliberation and great care, were; the figures which ought to be received. When did this deliberation begin? Did not the noble Lord deliberate on this question when he introduced the Bill, because at that time he took the figure of &#x00A3;15? Why should it be &#x00A3;26 now and &#x00A3;15 in January? He said now that &#x00A3;15 was inadequate. Was it that he did not consider the matter at all before January, or had the noble Lord received further information which caused him to change his opinion? They wanted really to ascertain what had been moving the Government with regard to this Bill. He hoped he would get some answer presently. That really analysed all the answer which the noble Lord had vouchsafed to give them, but he hoped he would tell them why &#x00A3;15, agreed to first, was so absurd now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01692"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has charge of the Bill made a speech just now the greater part of which seemed to be rather of the nature of a speech on Second Reading than a speech directed to this particular Amendment. He told us that this Bill was very much desired by the working-classes in the large Scottish burghs. I have no doubt whatever that this is the case, nor, as I understand it, is there anything in the Amendment put down by Lord Clinton which is in any way hostile to the policy of the Bill. As I understand it, the policy of the Bill is to be found in the three clauses to which the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, referred&#x2014;the clause dealing with the time limit to missives, the clause relating to notice to terminate a tenancy, and the clause dealing with the law of hypothec. None of these points are in any way affected by the Amendment of Lord Clinton. The only point raised by the Amendment is this. The noble Lord challenges the particular money limit prescribed in Clause 2 with regard to the value of houses which will come within the scope of this measure. I must say I think my noble friend made a fairly strong case to show that a lower limit than that mentioned in the Bill might reasonably he accepted. In the first place, unless I misunderstand the case, the limit suggested by my noble friend is the limit which was
<col>610</col>
at first adopted by the Government themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01693"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: That is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01694"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Then the noble Lord points out the hardship of excluding some members who might properly be described as belonging to the working-classes from the operation of this particular clause, and he says there are foremen and well-paid operatives who rent houses valued at &#x00A3;20 a year. I have no doubt that that is the case; but surely when you come to persons who rent houses of that kind of value it is fair to suggest with regard to them that they do not belong to the helpless migratory population for whom the advantages of this Bill are specially designed. Men occupying houses of over &#x00A3;20 valuation surely would come within the category described by Lord Clinton of those who are settled in their homes and look forward to a more lengthened period of residence in them. I feel, in dealing with these Scottish questions that we who are not familiar with the intricacies of Scottish matters are somewhat at a disadvantage, and we naturally look to the authority which can be cited on one side or the other. Now Lord Pentland rests himself, I take it, upon the authority of the Scottish Members of Parliament. My two noble friends, on the contrary, rest themselves upon the very strong and decided expressions of opinion that have been laid before us by the local authorities of these burghs. The nobly Lord who is in charge of the Bill went out of his way to tell us, quite correctly, that this is not a Party measure, and I think, therefore, we are entitled to observe that possibly the constituted local authorities of these great cities may upon the whole be at least as reliable guides as the gentlemen who happen for the moment to represent those cities in Parliament, many of whom, it is suggested to me, are not Scotsmen at all. In these circumstances, although I should greatly regret being forced to a Division on the point, if my noble friend divides the Committee I shall vote with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01695"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that apparently the debate was over, but he again asked for an answer from the noble Lord why &#x00A3;15 was a perfectly good figure in January but had now become a bad one? This figure of &#x00A3;20 was accepted by the Committee as the highest and as likely
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0312"/>
<col>611</col>
to include all the workmen in Glasgow; if Lord Pentland would look at the report he would find that this was so; and as far as Glasgow was concerned &#x00A3;20 would be acceptable instead of &#x00A3;26.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01696"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> hoped the noble Earl would acquit him of being surreptitious in his actions with regard to this Bill. To his personal knowledge this had been a debated question in Scotland for the last sixteen or seventeen years, and there had been ten or twelve Bills introduced by private Members into the House of Commons in the endeavour to deal with it. It was an exceedingly difficult and intricate question, and the Government had not felt able to deal with it without further information. They appointed a Committee which reported, but, in spite of that Report, until the Bill was actually introduced and proceeded with active interest in the subject did not arise.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01697">It was perfectly well known that if the Government introduced a Bill on a certain subject at the beginning of a session and no action was taken upon it, however much it affected the interests of local authorities they would receive no communications and no information upon it from those authorities. But the moment it was known that the Government meant to find time to deal with the question interest was aroused, and those who were concerned met and said "We are now forced to come to a decision and make up our minds on this question." That was precisely how more mature, and, he believed, more correct information came before the Government in the later stages of this controversy.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01702">On Question, Amendments agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01703"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> desired to ask a question on the second paragraph in Clause 2, which ran:&#x2014;
<quote>"The expression 'assessing authority' includes a town council, a parish council, and every other body entitled to impose an assessment."</quote>
This Bill by Clause 12 made owners responsible for all rates on houses which came under the Bill&#x2014;all assessments which were imposed by the assessing authority. What did "assessment" mean? It included "all rates, charges, and assessments imposed, assessed, or levied by an assessing authority." An assessing authority included "a town council, a parish council, and every other body entitled to impose an assessment." This Bill had to do with rating and with municipal assessments. Then how did this term "parish council" come in? A parish council levied the poor rate and the poor rate only, and had nothing to do with house rating or anything of that kind. How had "parish council" found its way into the Bill? It was not in the Bill as originally introduced, but was inserted in Grand Committee. What would be the effect of introducing parish councils into the Bill? A parish council levied the poor rate on the occupier, and on the occupier only. It had no right of recourse for the poor rate to the owner. Yet this Bill said that the rates levied by a parish council were to be included in the rates which came under this Bill. Had Lord Pentland noticed that by inserting these words he had made a most enormous change in the Poor Law, which had nothing to do with this Bill at all? The result would be that the poor rates of occupiers up to the figure in the Bill, would be compounded for and would be paid by the owners, who would have to recover them from the occupiers. There was no necessity for a poor man to pay his poor rates in order to be on the Parliamentary voters' roll. Had the noble Lord noticed that? The question was raised where it came in under owner would pay the rates and would try
<col>614</col>
to recover them from the occupier. If they looked at Clause 13 they would see that&#x2014;
<quote>"Owners shall have relief against occupiers of dwelling-houses for the full amount of such assessments, without deduction, but such assessments shall only be recoverable by such owners from the occupiers along with payments of rent."</quote>
Suppose the occupier would not pay the poor rate to the owner who had already paid it. Very frequently an occupier would not pay his rates. The result would be that the occupier would be on the Parliamentary roll and yet would not have paid his rates to anybody. There was a further point. The owner might not pay the poor rates, and in that case nobody would pay them, and yet the occupier would by this Bill become enfranchised. He could not imagine that this was intended. The effect of inserting the term "parish council" had been to make a most important change in the Poor Law, and would have a great effect on the Parliamentary roll. Unless the noble Lord could give some good reason why these words had been inserted he would be bound to move that they be omitted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01704"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said that so far as he was aware "parish council" was put with the other assessing authorities. They treated all the assessing authorities in the same way. No doubt this Bill did make changes. He was not concerned to deny it, but they were perfectly obvious on the face of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01705"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> denied that they were very obvious. He was afraid the noble Lord was much cleverer than himself, because it took him some time before he fully realised the effect of it. He had shown their Lordships how a man could be on the Parliamentary voters' roll without having paid his rates. That brought into this Bill the question of the franchise. What in the world had the franchise to do with this Bill?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01706"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said that if it was their Lordships' wish that the franchise question which the noble Earl had detected in the Bill should be discussed now, he was at their Lordships' service, but he thought it would be more convenient if the franchise question was raised where it came in under the compounding clauses.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01713"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said there were two different questions raised in this Bill owing to the form which this definition had taken in Grand Committee. One was the municipal rates, which were perfectly germane to this Bill, and the compounding of which they were perfectly able to discuss. But this was a matter which had nothing to do with the Bill, and he wanted to know why the term "parish council" had been inserted, because if retained it would have a most important effect, not on the municipal roll, because that belonged to the Bill, but upon the Parliamentary roll, which had nothing whatever to do with the Bill. He hoped the noble Lord would discuss it now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01714"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said the matter was simply this. The working-man did not discriminate between one rate and another. Under the present system he was obliged to take a yearly let, and to pay the rates
<col>616</col>
as a lump sum at the end of the year. The whole system of the collection of rates at present rested upon the system of yearly lets. If they were going to alter that and make it short lets, they could not have the collection of any rates. They must deal with all the rates together.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01768"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said he would assume that Lord Courtney would support him, and he would try to give the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland reasons why he thought Clause 12 ought to be omitted from the Bill. His task had been very much simplified by the fact that they had got rid of the question of the franchise, which had nothing to do with the Bill. Clause 12 had simply to do with municipal assessments. It proposed that every assessment authority entitled to impose assessments in the burgh should levy all assessments which might be properly chargeable to occupiers on the owners of dwelling-houses. That was an enormous extension of the system of compounding. At the present time the rates were compounded in some burghs up to &#x00A3;4 and in others up to &#x00A3;5. Under this clause as the Bill stood before Amendment they would be corn-pounded up to &#x00A3;26, with the practical result that in Glasgow the rates would be compounded for nearly 160,000 out of 175,000 houses. The assessor would have comparatively little to do, because all that would remain for him would be the collecting of rates on the bigger houses in which the labour and difficulty was, of course, the smallest. What were the reasons for objecting to this compounding of municipal rates? In the first place it removed all direct connection between the occupier and the assessing authority. In the second place, it placed an additional burden upon the general ratepayers in respect of the commission which was given to the owner who had to collect the rates. But beyond that it was objected to by the burghs, and it was also objected to by the owners of houses. The owners of houses naturally did not wish to be placed in the invidious position of rate collectors to the great majority of their tenants, and the burghs objected to it, because, as they said, the amount of commission which would have to be added to the total sum levied meant an additional burden upon the general ratepayer. He objected to any extension whatever of this system of compounding;
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0317"/>
<col>621</col>
he believed their Lordships also objected to it, as also did the Poor Law Commission and every set of persons who had inquired into this matter. The evil done by this system was almost incalculable. It had led to the condonation of municipal extravagance and to carelessness on the part of occupiers as to the amount of money spent. Though it might be impossible to do away with it, yet to extend compounding until it really embraced five-sixths of the houses in a town was a thing which he hoped would not be agreed to. Those were his reasons for proposing the omission of the clause.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01770"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> said he supposed he ought to add some words to the speech of the noble Earl, but he must apologise in the first place for intervening in this subject at all, because he was not as acquainted even with the elementary facts of Scottish legislation as he ought to be in order to justify his appearance in the debate. The previous evening he was approached by the representatives, of Glasgow, who desired to have an opportunity of presenting their side of the case to their Lordships. They could not find any one to put their Amendments on the Paper, and so he had consented to do so in the hope that he would have the support of some one of their Lordships connected with Scotland who would be able to speak on the subject, but as a matter of fact that had not happened and he was still left in charge of his Amendments. His duty, therefore, was to explain to their Lordships as clearly as he could what those Amendments meant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01771"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> pointed out that the only Amendment he had moved was to omit Clause 12.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01772"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> replied that the noble Earl had supported that Amendment by an argument against compounding. His (Lord Courtney's) own Amendment was for the substitution of another method of compounding, giving, as he believed, a much simpler and more effective and convenient method of compounding than that in the Bill. Moreover, he proposed a clause making the adoption of the system optional, so that his Amendments differed
<col>622</col>
from those of the noble Earl opposite, although they both started with the desire to get rid of Clause 12 as it stood. He would now ask to be allowed to explain the Amendments standing in his name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01773"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> observed that his Amendment stood on the Paper before that of the noble Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01774"><member>LORD STANMORE</member> said that surely the only question before the Committee was whether they should or should not strike out Clause 12.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01775"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> said that on the general question of retaining the system in the Bill it appeared that the two noble Lords took different roads. As to the noble Earl's charge that the franchise was affected by the Bill, there was no doubt that it was affected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01776"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that that was not the case now, because they had omitted all reference to the parish council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01777"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> remarked that in that case he was discharged from saying anything further.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01778"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> thought he ought to say a word as to compounding in reference to the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown. The noble Earl had admitted that the system of compounding could not be got rid of altogether, and what he objected to was any extension of it. The desire of authorities like Glasgow was of great importance, and of smaller cities also; they saw in compounding an absolutely necessary way of getting the rates which might be levied in respect of small holdings. That was what had made the system inevitable in England, and with short lettings he submitted compounding was practically inevitable. It might be left to the local authorities whether they would adopt it or not, but in course of time they would all have to adopt it in connection with small lettings. The expense of collecting rates from tenants on short lets was so excessive and the risk was so great of not getting them at all that that system could not be maintained. The noble Earl objected because he said the authorities would lose
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0318"/>
<col>623</col>
the amount of the commission which they would have to give to owners who became collectors of the rates. He would point out that Glasgow would not adopt the system if they thought they were going to lose by it. He submitted that the system of compounding was inevitable if they were going to allow short lets to obtain and to be extended in Scotland, and the question whether it was advantageous or not to the funds of the municipalities was a matter to be left to them. They would not adopt the system unless they thought they would gain more in the way of revenue by receiving the rates through the owners than they could possibly gain if they tried to extract them direct from weekly or monthly tenants. He did not agree that compounding deadened the interest of small occupiers in the rates because they did not pay them direct. In meal or in malt they had to pay; it was merely a matter of collection. He would not go into the political aspect, which had been the subject of great controversy in the past in their Lordships' House. Because of some supposed political deleterious effect compounding was abolished in England under Mr. Disraeli's Reform Act, but it had to be re-established within three years and had prevailed ever since, and it was impossible to prevent it if they were to allow that liberty of contract which had not prevailed so much in Scotland as in England and which was expressed in the system of short lettings. Unless they meant to destroy the system of compounding it was unwise to throw out the clause. He was only prepared to alter the method, and as it stood he was afraid he would have to vote against his own Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01779"><member>LORD STANMORE</member> observed, with reference to the optimism of the noble Lord as to the increased receipts of municipalities, that that opinion was not shared at all events by the town councillors of Aberdeen, who calculated that something between &#x00A3;2,000 and &#x00A3;3,000 a year would be lost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01780"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member> thought that the noble Lord (Lord Courtney) might salve his conscience because the first Amendment stood in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, Therefore the noble Lord could vote upon that Amendment and need not bother about his own at that moment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01795"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>, in moving to leave out Clause 17 and to insert a new clause standing in his name, said the effect of his Amendment would be that as regarded all the burghs in Scotland with the exception of the five large burghs mentioned in the Bill the law would remain the same as it was now.

In the second place, their Lordships would see that the number of short lets, which of course implied a great deal of additional trouble and expense to an owner, would be very considerably increased. The proposed new clause was not really his own clause but one which had been agreed upon between a very large majority of the burghs, almost all of them with the exception of Glasgow. He could not speak about Edinburgh because Edinburgh up to the day before was perhaps one of the very strongest opponents of the Bill; he had heard that they no longer supported the clause he was moving, why, he was not able to tell their Lordships. Further, there was a power conferred in subsection (<i>b</i>) of his Amendment upon assessing authorities of compelling payment of rates by instalments, which would create great facility in the collection.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01797"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> pointed out that the position was that Lord Camperdown had an Amendment forbidding any extension of compounding, and that Lord Courtney had a series of Amendments which would have the effect of introducing compounding under a different method from that adopted by the Government in the Bill. He had some reason for doubting the extent of the support which the noble Earl had for his proposals, for he had told them that Glasgow certainly and Edinburgh he thought both opposed, and they were not unimportant exceptions when they considered the proportion of their population as compared with the rest of Scotland. They were the two most important municipalities in Scotland. They had to choose between compounding in some form or other and rejecting the short let system proposed by the Bill. The objection which the noble Earl took to compounding was that it conferred the franchise on a certain number of people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01798"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said that it did not now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01799"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> pointed out that they had compounding in England and in Scotland for householders of &#x00A3;4 and under. There was no loss of franchise by non-payment of rates, and there was an allowance to owners who collected and paid the rates of the occupiers. If they began at &#x00A3;15 and under they were faced by the fact that householders of &#x00A3;4 and under were struck out. They were going to deprive occupiers of houses of &#x00A3;5, &#x00A3;6, &#x00A3;7, &#x00A3;8, and &#x00A3;9 a year of a relief which they sought persistently and with great earnestness, because the compounding system was an inevitable accompaniment of a system of short lets. By the Reform Bill occupiers of &#x00A3;10 were not disfranchised
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0320"/>
<col>627</col>
by the non-payment of rates, and he considered the Amendment was penal treatment of occupiers between the limits of &#x00A3;4 and &#x00A3;10. They were deprived of the opportunity of compounding which all experience showed gave the boon of an elastic system of house-letting, which no noble Lord could deny was the only fair and just accompaniment of an industrial system which required mobility of labour. He could say honestly that from the beginning to the end of the controversy there had been no ulterior motive or eye to enfranchisement on the part of the Government. Who should say on which side those people, if they were enfranchised, would cast their votes? Municipalities were only concerned with getting their rates paid. It was far from the truth, if noble Lords would permit him to say it, that the collection of rates and the responsibility for the payment of rates were more realised by and more intimate to these small householders under the present system that it would be under the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01800">Under the system which they wished to introduce it was absolutely certain that ratepayers would have their obligations more directly pressed home to them, and although they would pay by instalments they would do what a great many of them did not do now&#x2014;pay their rates. The Bill did its best to mitigate objections to the payment of rates being thrown in with the payment of rent by the fact that a note was presented indicating precisely on every rent demand the proportion due in respect of rates. To take the case of Edinburgh, Edinburgh did not enforce the payment of rates at all on householders below &#x00A3;5, and in all of the towns there were large exemptions as the result of appeals <i>ad misericordiam</i> of householders who paid more than &#x00A3;5. He thought he was correct in saying that no less than &#x00A3;43,000 was the deficit in a recent year to the Glasgow municipality in the payment of rates. Those who knew&#x2014;and he was obliged to take their authority for it&#x2014;were emphatic and clear in their opinion that the method of the Bill, whether it enfranchised or did anything in other respects, would enforce a better collection of rates, and the municipal burdens, so far from being increased, as the noble Earl had said, by the amount of commission paid to owners, would be considerably lessened. The commission would be absolutely submerged in the total gain to the municipalities in
<col>628</col>
the amount of rates collected. Workingmen now-a-days did all their transactions by weekly and monthly payments, their trade and building societies, their investments, their savings banks&#x2014;every expenditure except the yearly house-letting, was dealt with by weekly or periodical instalments. If a working-man bought, say, a sewing machine, he paid for it by instalments. They would say he was foolish because he naturally paid more. But the working-man did not do it because he was foolish; he did it because he could not afford to pay cash. Municipalities did not care a whit for the franchise; their object was to get their rates paid, and working-men were perfectly willing to submit to the additional burden which they would have to bear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01801">The Burgh Police Act of 1892 contained a clause permitting short lets without giving any allowance to the owners for the collection of rates, but it threw the onus of that collection upon them. Owners would not take that responsibility and incur the expense of collectors and agents and clerks and so forth which was involved, and they had never availed themselves of that clause. No system by which responsibility was laid upon owners for the payment of rates would work unless they gave owners a compounding allowance to cover them from the outlay thrown upon them by such a condition. He had shown from beginning to end that municipalities, house-owners, working-men, and&#x2014;he said it without fear of contradiction&#x2014;the Government, had simply one object in view&#x2014;namely, the economic and social adjustment of the question. He appealed to their Lordships to consider the plan proposed, because he believed it was a practical and working plan to provide a social remedy for a most deserving class of men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01802"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said he rose for the purpose of correcting one or two statements made by the noble Lord. Men who held houses of between &#x00A3;5 and &#x00A3;10 would pay their rates direct as they did now. As to the noble Lord's assurance that all the municipalities were on his side, he was again obliged to cite the authority of Edinburgh and quote from the Petition which Edinburgh presented to their Lordships' House and which he took it expressed their considered opinion. In passing he would say that the commission to the owner must be a sufficient one; it was no good proposing ten per cent. in one case
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0321"/>
<col>629</col>
and five per cent. in another. As the Bill stood the Sheriff would have to fix the commission, but it was very doubtful whether he would fix it at such rates as ten per cent. or five per cent. If he did, his belief was that it would not compensate the owners for the trouble they would be put to. Where rates were compounded in England he believed there was no commission so low as five per cent., in some cases it was twenty-five per cent. The petition to which he had referred went on to say that though the system under the Bill would cost more in collection it would not produce any larger revenue, and that it would increase the burden on the occupiers; and, further, that assuming the rate of commission to be fifteen per cent., it would mean in Edinburgh &#x00A3;12,000 a year, or equivalent to one penny in the pound, and that amount would rise or fall according as the commission was higher or lower. That seemed to show that in the opinion of the Town Council of Edinburgh what the noble Lord had just said was not correct.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01803"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> pointed out that the really dominant note running through the speech of the Secretary for Scotland was that compounding was a necessary part of letting for short periods. The noble Lord no doubt had studied the Report of Lord Guthrie's Departmental Committee. In that Report it was stated that compounding was not a necessary corollary of short lets. That was really a great authority to quote against the noble Lord. The Amendment provided for the system of instalments which the Committee thought necessary, a system which was just both for the rating authority and for the occupier. He believed that under the Amendment of the noble Earl they provided everything that was necessary to bring short lettings into being, and he was sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Pentland, should, so to speak, have held a pistol at their Lordships' heads and said unless they had compounding they could not have short lettings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01804"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that like the noble Lord, Lord Courtney, he made no pretence to be entitled to speak on Scottish questions, but he had given considerable thought and study to the question of compounding in so far as it affected England. He remembered fighting forty years ago for a whole night in the House of Commons against the Act which restored compounding, and he had never wavered from his opinion
<col>630</col>
that it was most unfortunate for local government that in the Reform Act of 1867 payment of rates and political franchise were mixed up together. There was nothing in the whole system of their local government which so conflicted with economic and sound administration as the system of compounding. The noble Lord, Lord Pentland, spoke of the necessity of a system of compounding if they were to have short lettings. His noble friend, Lord Clinton, had already quoted a very great authority against that view. He would remind the noble Lord of what perhaps he might not be acquainted with himself, being a Scotsman, that there were parishes in England at the present moment where rates were collected from individual occupiers, where composition had not been adopted, and yet where short lettings existed. He knew of such parishes himself where the collection of the rates either by quarterly or half-yearly instalments was arranged without any difficulty arising from the absence of composition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01805"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> asked whether those were rural or industrial parishes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01806"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> was speaking of rural parishes. He could not speak, he admitted, with the same knowledge of industrial communities, but certainly there were large urban parishes in which composition had not been adopted, and even in rural parishes there were frequent changes of tenancy. With regard to the larger communities, he could not agree with Lord Courtney that the system of composition was really approved of on its merits by the local authorities themselves. He thought the real point was this, that the rate collectors found that the system of composition made it unquestionably easier for them to collect the rates than the system of personal payment, and that they had used their influence, which was very great, with the local authorities in order to secure the adoption of composition. He believed it was a distinct loss to local authorities where composition was adopted, for he thought that if they were to allow anything like the allowance made to owners in cases of composition, which usually was as much as twenty-five per cent., to their rate collectors and insisted on personal payment of rates it would be to the benefit of the rates and not to their injury. He did not know how that view might apply to Scotland; he was speaking of England, but he had always imagined that Scotsmen
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0322"/>
<col>631</col>
were more thrifty than Englishmen and therefore more capable of paying their rates if, as would be provided under the Amendment of his noble friend Lord Camperdown, proper security was taken for the rates being levied by convenient instalments. He should be very sorry indeed to see the system of composition which now prevailed extended, and therefore he would certainly support the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01807"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said he did not feel competent to express an opinion upon the proposal in the Bill to extend the compounding system, but on the general question of compounding he wished to give his experience. He was a member of the finance committee of the municipality with which he was concerned, namely, Belfast&#x2014;and owing to defalcations in the rate collections many suggestions had been offered as to how the rates should be collected, and in going very carefully into the matter the question of the compounding had come up. He was naturally in agreement with their Lordships that if possible the compounding system should be done away with, because he thought the argument that the citizen should understand his liabilities as a citizen should be borne in upon him. But after careful consideration he must support the view of the noble Lord opposite, that with weekly rents and very small houses they could not get rid of the system of compounding; and he thought it would cost municipalities more to collect the rates themselves than to pay a commission to owners for so doing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01808"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>, in supporting what the noble Earl who had just sat down had said, pointed out that when he was on the London County Council he was personally responsible for the purchase of three very large estates at Croydon, Tooting, and Tottenham. The estate at Tottenham consisted of 200 acres and cost &#x00A3;90,000, and cottages were to be built upon it to house 42,000 people. It was gradually being covered with houses, although, of course, the new policy of the Moderate majority of the London County Council had now stopped work to a very great extent. There was only one difficulty at Tottenham, and that was that they did not allow compounding. There was no difficulty at Tooting and no difficulty at Norbury, near Croydon. But the result at Tottenham was that though there
<col>632</col>
was no difficulty whatever about the rent, the tenants paying their rent with the greatest possible case and regularity, when they were asked to pay the rates they did what was called "a flit." They bolted, the London County Council lost one week's rent and a very good tenant, and the local authority lost the rates. He did not agree that compounding made a citizen irresponsible for the rates and careless as to whether they went up or down.</p>

<title>CONSOLIDATION BILLS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01818"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether the Board of Trade had considered the propriety of printing Bills which were partly for the amendment and partly for the consolidation of the law in such a way as to distinguish between old and new matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01819">The noble Marquess said: Your Lordships may remember that at an early period of this session I ventured to put a question in debate to His Majesty's Government as to whether it would be possible to print Bills which were partly consolidation Bills and partly amending Bills in such a way that your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0323"/>
<col>633</col>
would be able to recognise at a glance what was new and what was old. Since then I have had the opportunity of conferring with different members of the Government, and I now venture to put the formal question whether His Majesty's Government see their way to comply with that suggestion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01820"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Earl replies, would it not be possible that measures brought before your Lordships' House which involve charges on the rates of a county should have such provisions as affect county rates put in italics? I believe that is the custom in the House of Commons, and I consider it would be of great public advantage that we should have some guidance in that way in respect to matters which sometimes affect the finances of the county to a larger extent than the Bill itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01821"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: I fancy that the question raised by the noble Marquess has been considered before, but it has not been taken in hand, I suppose for the reason that those Bills have not in past years been very frequent, although when they do come before us they are enormously bulky and very often important. It has, however, been pointed out to me that there is this difficulty, that in consolidating a number of previous Acts into a new Bill certain formal and verbal changes are made, altering the actual phrases used in the old Acts but containing all their substance, and it is not quite clear what the noble Marquess would wish done in a case of that kind. It is consolidation but at the same time it is an alteration, and it is considered, I believe, by the best authorities&#x2014;we have taken the opportunity in the interval of consulting those who are best entitled to speak&#x2014;that in many cases a marginal note or even an explanatory memorandum is the best form of explanation rather than anything to do with the printing. So far as, the Stationery Office is concerned, I am informed that there would be no technical difficulty, provided of course that the Bill is sent to them by the draftsman in a clearly marked form carrying out what the noble Marquess wishes. I can assure him we will bear the matter in mind, but I have no doubt he has followed what I have said as to the technical difficulty which might arise in certain cases, because, of course, it is conceivable that a difference of opinion might exist as to whether the
<col>634</col>
change in the phraseology involved some slight difference although done merely to represent the precise effect of the previous Act in a more compendious form. There might be a difference of opinion as to whether it did or did not make some slight difference in the law in effect, and the attention of noble Lords might be drawn away from that possibility by the fact that it was printed as a mere consolidation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01822"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: In speaking of what was old and what was new, I certainly referred to the substance and not to the phraseology. I quite recognise that part of the point of a consolidation Act is to put the old law into better phraseology. The noble Lord says a suspicion might arise that the new phraseology concealed a very slight change in the law, and therefore noble Lords' attention ought not to be directed away from it. But we are in that position now. When a pure consolidation Bill comes before your Lordships a Minister says "This is pure consolidation," and when he says so with his responsibility everybody accepts his assurance, and unless we are to have that trust in it which we ought to have we could not get on at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01823"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I quite see the force of what has fallen from the noble Marquess, and we will consider before the next Consolidation Bill goes out, in what form it would be most convenient for the House to have a distinction made. As regards the question put by the noble Viscount, he will excuse me if I do not give him a definite answer at this moment, because it requires more consideration than I am prepared to give it now. I am not entirely convinced by the analogy to which the noble Viscount drew attention&#x2014;namely, that in another place the the financial parts are printed in italics. That I take to be because a separate resolution is required. According to the forms which obtain there, they require a separate resolution to carry them into effect, and so far as charges on the rates are dealt with here that, of course, is not the case. I will take the whole question into consideration and see if it is possible in any way to meet the wishes of the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01829">Moved, That the Report be now received.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Beauchamp.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01830"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, upon the Motion which has just been submitted by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, I desire to call the attention of your Lordships to an incident which occurred at the very end of the Committee stage. Almost at the very end, after the ordinary means of communication with the outside world were more or less ineffective, the noble Earl moved a clause exempting from the operation of the Bill Crown lands in Scotland, and it appeared in the course of the discussion that the clause was rendered necessary, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, because the practice of the Constitution in England and in Scotland are different. In England the Crown and that which belongs to the prerogatives of the Crown are not included in any Act of Parliament unless the Crown is specifically mentioned, but in Scotland it is not so, or, at any rate, there is a doubt as to its being so or not. And therefore in order to exempt the Crown lands of Scotland it was necessary to insert a clause specifically mentioning that.<lb/>
But the moving of the clause had a very different effect from that which was anticipated by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill,
<col>636</col>
for it served to call the attention of your Lordships to the fact, which your Lordships had not at that moment realised, that the Crown lands of England were not within the purview of the Bill. That was a most astonishing confession for the noble Earl inferentially to make. The Crown is a very large owner in many parts of England of town property. The Crown is also a very large owner of rural property, which is, of course, covered with habitations of all sorts. One would have thought that there was no reason on the face of it why Crown lands should be exempt from the housing part of the Bill, for if it is necessary that people should have good houses upon the property of private individuals it is equally necessary that they should have good houses when they occupy them upon Crown property. When we turn from the housing part of the Bill to the town-planning part, the case is still stronger. The property of the Crown&#x2014;I have not been able to lay my hand upon any Report which exactly describes it&#x2014;exists in a great many counties of England, notably Lancashire, where there is the property of the great Duchy of Lancaster. That county especially, and other counties too, will be most specifically concerned in the town-planning part of the Bill, for there are the great spreading urban communities. They will have to do in this respect with Crown lands quite as much as with anybody else's lands, while the Crown lands are exempted from the operation of the Bill.<lb/>
As I said before, that was a most astonishing admission for the noble Earl in charge of the Bill to make. We on this side of the House were so much astonished at the proposal that Scotland should be exempted that several of us at once rose in our places and protested in the warmest manner, and your Lordships were good enough to accept the advice we tendered and the clause was at once rejected. His Majesty's Government must have done it by inadvertence, because if they had had time to consider the effect of their policy, they would have taken a very different course. So far from desiring to exempt the Crown lands in Scotland, I hope they will be prepared to include the Crown lands in England. I ask His Majesty's Government to-day, specifically and on behalf of a great number of noble Lords on this side of the House, to include the Crown lands wherever they may be found in the United Kingdom. I need not say I am not
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0325"/>
<col>637</col>
referring to that property of the Crown which is set apart for the amenity or convenience of His Majesty himself in person. That, of course, ought to be exempted from the operation of such a Bill. I am speaking of the Crown lands as they are known generally in legislation, those properties of the Crown which are transferred to the administration of Parliament at the beginning of every reign, and are administered, as your Lordships all know, by the great Public Departments. Such lands, we submit, ought to be included in a Bill of this kind.<lb/>
The noble Earl used language about half-past eleven o'clock of a most remarkable kind, for he seemed to think that such a power, if granted in a town-planning Bill, Might be used to the disadvantage of the Crown lands. What interest can the Crown have in being a bad landlord? What interest can the Crown have in resisting the legitimate expansion of these great urban communities? Why does His Majesty's Government desire to narrow to this extent the operation of the Bill? I see it publicly stated in many parts of the Press that the House of Lords has been engaged in narrowing the operation of the Bill and confining it, but it seems that the greatest sinner in this respect is His Majesty's Government itself. The noble Earl seemed to think when he spoke that the operation of the Bill might be exercised to the detriment of the property of the Crown committed to the charge of the various Government Departments. Well, my Lords, what is this doctrine of detriment? Are we to say that the Bill itself is to be exercised to the detriment of the property of private individuals? Is it the contention of His Majesty's Government that the Bill is to be exercised if passed into law to the detriment of the property of private landowners? It will only be to their detriment in so far as they are bad landlords, and why should the Crown be the only owner privileged to be a bad landlord? No, it is quite clear that what is good for other landowners is good for the Crown, and if protection is required for certain great national interests&#x2014;property, for instance, in the hands of the Admiralty or of the War Office&#x2014;let those great Departments signify their pleasure to the Local Government Board, and when the Provisional Order comes before the Board they will know how to deal with it. That is quite sufficient protection. As to other properties, there should be no exception
<col>638</col>
made, and the Crown lands ought to be treated like any other lands.<lb/>
I ought to apologise to your Lordships for having addressed you at this length upon this occasion, but the reason is this. I understand it is not within the power of any private member of your Lordships' House to make this alteration in the Bill. I know it is the rule in the other House, and I believe it is the rule here. No private Member can include the Crown in the operation of any Statute, and such a change or amendment in the Bill can only be carried into effect by a Minister of the Crown. Therefore, the only opportunity I have of urging this matter is at this stage when the question is put that the Report be received. I ask your Lordships to join with me in pressing on His Majesty's Government the importance of consistency in this matter, and the necessity of remedying this defect in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01831"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the position of His Majesty's Government with regard to the special matter which the noble Marquess has brought before your Lordships is really the same as the attitude which they have decided to take up with regard to the various other matters which your Lordships dealt with in the Committee stage of this Bill. May I say, in passing, that I believe it is a matter of accuracy that there is no provision in your Lordships' House with regard to matters affecting the Crown being dealt with on the initiative of the Crown. It is open to the noble Marquess to take such steps as he thinks necessary in the matter. But the position of His Majesty's Government with regard to those other Amendments is plainly this. Your Lordships saw fit to make certain Amendments in this Bill during the three days it was being considered in Committee, and although His Majesty's Government naturally do not agree with a large number of those Amendments still they hardly thought it would be respectful to your Lordships' House to ask you to deliberately reverse on Report conclusions which you came to during the Committee stage. That is why I say we are unable to accept the invitation of the noble Marquess, as it is open to him to make those suggestions which he thinks right but which we do not think His Majesty's Government could be expected to suggest after having made suggestions in the Committee stage which were rejected.</membercontribution></p>

But I think it went too far. I entirely agreed with the noble Marquess Who has just spoken in objecting to the clause as it stood, but unquestionably certain kinds of Crown property should be exempt from this Bill. A Bill of this kind ought, so far as my judgment goes, not to interfere with Crown property which is in the nature of Post Office buildings, or Admiralty dockyards, or War Office buildings, or anything of that kind. All I think the noble Marquess desires is to bring within the scope of the Bill Crown property of the nature of farm lands or cottages, so that the same law may apply to them as would apply to private property. That seems to me a very fair proposition, and I hope His Majesty's Government will agree to it in due course.</membercontribution></p>

He said no doubt their Lordships would remember that there was some discussion in Committee with regard to this clause and that an Amendment was inserted on the motion of the noble Viscount who had just addressed the House. The proposal was accepted in substance by His Majesty's Government, but they were anxious to secure some further amendment of the words. He desired to say, with regard to

this and further Amendments which he would move, there was no point of principle or contention between noble Lords opposite and themselves. They had been careful, he thought, without exception to put down Amendments only of a somewhat drafting nature. With the consent of the noble Viscount he also desired to insert the word "not," so that the phrase would read "the probability that the required accommodation will <i>not</i> be otherwise provided." The word "not" did not appear in the notice of his Amendments on Report.</p>

He presumed he would be entitled to take his two Amendments together as it would be rather meaningless to take them separately. In considering Clause 14, all recollection of Clause 47 defining "working classes" must not be lost sight of. In moving his Amendments he desired to deal with two points. In the first place, the definition of "working classes," and, in the second place, the obligation of landlords to tenants and the extent of that obligation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01843">As the clause stood at the present time the relation of the landlord to the tenant and the definition of "working classes" were somewhat mingled together. His desire was to separate them absolutely and entirely. No doubt it was claimed by noble Lords opposite and the authors of the Bill that as it stood the definition of "working classes" was better expressed in terms of money value. It was so expressed in the Act of 1890, and no doubt His Majesty's Government would claim that this clause was merely an extension of that Act. But so long as rents were low and were &#x00A3;20 in London, &#x00A3;13 for towns of 50,000 inhabitants, and &#x00A3;8 for rural districts, he did not deny for one moment that they did cover the cases of the great bulk of working-class tenants, and that they did serve probably very well indeed as the basis of a definition. But when they increased those rents, may more, when they doubled them and raised the figure to &#x00A3;40 for London, &#x00A3;26 for towns of 50,000 inhabitants, and &#x00A3;8 or &#x00A3;16, as the case might be, for rural districts, he could not think that that definition could still be maintained. The principle of the definition of rent must break down some time or other. Let it be supposed that the Local Government Board in its enthusiasm had placed &#x00A3;80 instead of &#x00A3;40 as the extent of the limit up to which the obligation of the landlord to the tenant should be imposed. He was sure that no noble Lord could possibly claim that such a proposal would include only and solely those who belonged to the working classes. He did not deny for one moment that it might be perfectly right and proper that the obligations of landlords to tenants should be extended and extended as it was under this clause; but he did not
<col>642</col>
wish that that obligation of the landlord should be in any way confused with the definition of a particular class of His Majesty's subjects.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01844">In subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 14 he deleted the words defining "working classes." That definition in his opinion belonged, as the Committee had decided, to a separate clause&#x2014;Clause 47&#x2014;and when the House reached that clause he proposed to make it of more general application. What he wished to do with Clause 14 was to make it nothing but a simple, plain, statement of the obligation of a landlord to a tenant, no matter whether that tenant belonged to the so-called working classes or not. Surely that was more simple and more intelligible than the attempt of His Majesty's Government to mention, he might almost say to confuse, a statement of the obligation of a landlord to a tenant together with a definition of "working classes." He did not think any one could quarrel with &#x00A3;40 as the limit in the case of London. Nor did he feel disposed to challenge the &#x00A3;26 for towns up to and over 50,000 inhabitants; but when they came to paragraph (<i>c</i>) "in the case of a house situate elsewhere," he did feel that that was a debatable point. He noticed that the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had an Amendment on the Paper to re-insert"&#x00A3;16" in all cases, and his noble friend Viscount St. Aldwyn had an Amendment down to include "&#x00A3;16" in the case of boroughs. He would remind their Lordships that he had had some experiences which were rather similar to those of the noble Earl; they had both been chief magistrates in towns, and he was sure that the noble Earl would bear him out in saying that there were a great number of houses between &#x00A3;8 and &#x00A3;16 which could not properly be claimed to be in a condition fit for human habitation. If his memory served him right, in his own locality there were houses where from the first floor to the second floor there was no staircase at all, and the inhabitants were obliged to get up by means of a ladder. He did not think any one could claim that such a house was reasonably fit for human habitation. Yet with this clause as it was, with its limit of &#x00A3;8, the landlords of those houses would be entirely exempt from the operation of this Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01845">Their Lordships would bear him out when he said how difficult it was in these small towns to get the local authority to put
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0328"/>
<col>643</col>
official pressure upon the individuals who owned these properties, and when it came to the medical officer of health, his experience of that officer was that in the examination of these houses he paid less regard to the condition of the houses than to whom the property might belong. He thought that the extension of &#x00A3;8 to &#x00A3;16 as proposed by his noble friend would undoubtedly fall upon the small owners of property. In this particular case, however, he would be guided entirely by his noble friend Viscount St. Aldwyn, because he had had considerable experience in these matters, but he trusted that his Amendment would meet with the approval of the majority of their Lordships.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01847"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he would follow the example of the noble Duke and deal with both Amendments. In the first place, he asked their Lordships to remember that they were dealing with this Bill as it stood, and he thought he might not unfairly point out that there was nothing in the Bill about an &#x00A3;80 limit. When the President of the Local Government Board did suggest that the limit should be raised to &#x00A3;80, then perhaps they might argue the question as to the conditions to be imposed. Meanwhile what they had to consider was the terms of the Bill, which, as they would see, in the case of London included a limit of &#x00A3;40 value. He was glad to think that when they came to paragraph (<i>c</i>), on the point as to whether it should be &#x00A3;16 or &#x00A3;8, His Majesty's Government would have the noble Duke opposite with them in their attempt to restore the original figure of &#x00A3;16 instead of &#x00A3;8. With regard to these general Amendments, the position of the Local Government Board was that the suggestion made by the noble Duke constituted a very real extension of the Bill. If the Amendment were adopted the clause would deal not only with houses meant for the working classes; that limitation would be entirely swept away. That was an extension of the Bill which at present, at any rate, His Majesty's Government would not be disposed to agree to. This clause as it stood was a reproduction, with certain necessary changes, of Section 75 of the Housing Act of 1890, and that was a reproduction of the
<col>644</col>
Housing Act of 1885. In these circumstances their Lordships would see that these terms and this language were incorporated in their legislation at the present time and it had worked without any difficulty. Therefore they thought it very desirable that they should continue to use those expressions which had done good service and had proved so satisfactory in the past. He therefore hoped their Lordships would not agree to the Amendments suggested by the noble Duke.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01848"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said that the noble Earl who had just spoken had founded his argument upon precedents of former Acts of Parliament. The noble Earl might be perfectly correct in saying that this was a thing which had been used hitherto, but as they grew older some of them grew wiser, and he saw no reason why they should not improve upon the drafting of former Acts of Parliament. The drafting of the clause, as their Lordships would remember, was in the Committee stage subjected to considerable criticism. The noble Earl had taken credit to himself that this clause was confined to the working classes. But the term "working classes" was not defined in the Bill as presented to their Lordships by His Majesty's Government. The term, in fact, was perfectly vague. That was a mistake which they set themselves to remedy, and upon the motion of his noble friend the Earl of Camperdown a clause was proposed which now took the place of Clause 47 of the Bill defining "working classes." But the moment they got to that point to try and define "working classes," there was produced at once a dislocation in Clause 14, because it might be that the definition which their Lordships gave of "working classes" in order to explain subsection (1) of Clause 14 would not be consistent with the pecuniary limits which were to be found in subsection (2) of Clause 14. In other words, Clause 14 was constructed upon a false basis. "Working classes" was mentioned as if all working-class people came within the pecuniary limits in the Bill. But they did not. They might have one living in a cottage outside those limits, or a man living in a cottage inside those limits who was not a member of the "working classes." Notwithstanding the precedents which the noble Earl had quoted, the clause contained a very grave objection. Many of their Lordships desired to have a definition of "working classes" in the Housing Acts.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0329"/>
<col>645</col>
They thought it ought to be definitely set out on the face of Acts of Parliament that a particular Act applied to working classes, and was so defined. But then they had the difficulty of Clause 14 to get over. The noble Duke proposed to get over it by leaving out "working classes" and making the clause general. The noble Earl, who was anxious to restrict the operation of the Bill, said it would be a very extreme extension. He did not agree with the noble Earl because the clause was still limited to the pecuniary limits in subsection (2); but, even if it were an extension of the Bill, he would have thought that his Majesty's Government would be the last to offer that as an objection to what they were doing under the Bill. Let them look at the Act not from a party point of view, but as a matter of substance. Did any one contend that any landlord desired to let a house to any one whether he was a member of the working classes or not, which was not fit for human habitation? There was always an implied contract, an obligation of good management, that a landlord should let his house in a condition fit for human habitation. And what was true of Clause 14 was also true of Clause 18. For his part he could see no objection to an extension of this Bill in this particular even if the noble Duke's Amendment really did extend it.</p>

<col>646</col>
and he is himself bound to do it, I think, in consideration of this Amendment, to make the definition of "working classes" merely an inclusive definition. He does not desire to confine the operation under these two clauses to what may be called "working classes." What the precise object is of leaving in the Bill any definition of "working classes" in these circumstances we shall no doubt hear when we come to the clause. Our difficulty in accepting the noble Duke's Amendment, for which there is in some points of view much to be said, is this, that this is a Housing of the Working Classes Bill, and it seems somewhat unusual to include in it a definition of purely general housing such as would be supplied by the clause as amended by the noble Duke. It is quite true, and I think I drew attention to the point on the Committee stage, that the definition of "working classes" is liable to exclude deserving persons. On the other hand you may exclude, by striking out the definition altogether, the idea that these houses are intended to accommodate the working classes. In a general sense, I confess you do admit a certain class of person whom I should have thought might hardly be supposed to come necessarily under the operation of the Bill. If, on the other hand, noble Lords opposite have changed their minds to that extent, I should be sorry to fight the matter further, although, of course, I cannot say that in another place it may not be desired to restore the original form of the clause. If this sudden and complete reversal of attitude does represent the views of noble Lords opposite, I have no wish to press the matter further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01852"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> said he sympathised with the Amendment of the noble Duke. He did not see the least necessity for having the term. "working classes" in the clause. He supposed the meaning of the clause was that it was to be a protection for people who hired houses under a certain limit, so that they could have pressure put on their landlords to keep them in proper repair and keep them habitable. Naturally, people hiring houses not of very great value had not as much power or means to have pressure put on their landlords as people who hired houses of greater value. He did not desire even the definition of "working classes" as moved by the Earl of Camperdown. He did not see the use of having this term, in at all, because subsection (2) was meant to protect people
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0330"/>
<col>647</col>
hiring houses of a certain value, so that they should be able to get repairs and necessary things done for them. He knew how very difficult it was for people in small houses to get repairs done, and he hoped His Majesty's Government would see their way to accept the spirit of the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01853"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to enter a protest against the statement twice made by the noble Earl opposite during the course of his speech that this Amendment moved by my noble friend the Duke of Marlborough denotes a sudden and complete reversal of our policy with regard to this question. We have endeavoured throughout these discussions to make it clear that we are not opposed either to the housing policy embodied in this Bill or to the part of the policy which has reference to town planning, although we have taken exception to the means by which that policy is to be given effect to under this Bill.<lb/>
What is the proposal made by the noble Duke? This clause, if we pass it, will enact that in any contract made after the passing of the Act for letting a house for habitation by persons of the working classes there shall be an implied condition that the house is fit for human habitation. There is, it seems to us, a blot in that proposal. In the first place, the Bill as originally introduced contained no definition of working classes. Then it is quite clear that if the clause passes as it stands the effect of it will be that this condition of fitness for human habitation will apply only, first, where the premises are to be inhabited by persons of the working classes, and second, where the rental of the premises falls within the figures given further on in the clause. We have endeavoured to correct the first blot by inserting elsewhere in the Bill a definition of "working classes." As for the second, let us suppose two houses absolutely identical side by side, one of them being inhabited by a person who is included in the definition of working classes" and the other by a person not within that definition. Why there should be an implied condition of fitness for human habitation in the case of one house and not in the case of the other, I cannot understand. My noble friend therefore suggests to your Lordships that in the case of all premises coming within the rental limits laid down in the clause this condition should be universally assumed.<lb/>
<col>648</col>
The noble Earl opposite represents this as new and dangerous extension. I should have thought myself it was a very salutary extension, and one to which most reasonable owners of house property would be very glad to submit; but if the noble Earl tells us that this extension is foreign to the Bill and if he will take upon himself the responsibility of saying that His Majesty's Government desire that there should be this discrimination between premises which are occupied by members of the working classes and premises occupied by persons other than the working classes, I do not know whether the noble Duke will press his Amendment, against the views of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>

ALDWYN</member> said he would like to understand, if they might do so, because it was surely germane, what course His Majesty's Government proposed to take with reference to Clause 47. What definition of "working classes" did His Majesty's Government propose to accept? Did they propose to accept the definition in Clause 47 either in the present or in a modified form, or did they propose to leave houses occupied by the working classes without any definition at all? If that was the Government's idea, it was a very dangerous one indeed. To enact that houses were to be built by local authorities for the working classes under compulsory orders from the Local Government Board without suggesting either a limit of value or the kind of persons intended by the "working classes" might surely lead to the erection of houses of much greater value than those hitherto contemplated for the working classes, with the result that a much greater burden would be placed on the ratepayers than Parliament had intended. Therefore if these words were to be struck out of the clause, surely they were entitled to some information from His Majesty's Government as to the view they were prepared to take with regard to Clause 47.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01864"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the noble Viscount was good enough on the Committee stage to postpone the question for further discussion on Report, and he had promised to try and provide the noble Viscount with some figures dealing with these districts and the cases of houses situated elsewhere. The noble Viscount had in the meantime put down an Amendment creating another class of house in another kind of area. The result of the Amendment would be, as their Lordships would see in a moment, to create three classes of houses, three scales of rent, in addition to the scale of rent inside London. The fact of the matter was that the dividing line suggested by the noble Viscount was
<col>650</col>
really an artificial line. It existed for various purposes of legislation, but with regard to the classes of house which were put into the two kinds of areas there was very little distinction indeed. The same kind of people lived in the small borough and urban districts as in the rural areas. Therefore His Majesty's Government were of opinion that it might create a certain amount of hardship if a limit of &#x00A3;16 was fixed for this new class.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01865">A few figures which he was glad to be able to give to the noble Viscount would, he hoped, persuade him that for houses situate elsewhere &#x00A3;8 was hardly sufficient, and it would be better to take the original proposal in the Bill and leave in the words &#x00A3;16 for houses in the small borough and urban districts and also in the rural areas. The only difference between the noble Viscount and His Majesty's Government was with regard to the rents in the rural areas, and if they could show that the rents in the rural areas were often over &#x00A3;8 in the case of working classes he hoped that the noble Viscount would agree to his (Earl Beauchamp's) subsequent Amendment. There were 376 urban districts with a population of less than 5,000, and 194 with a population of less than 3,000. There were sixty-seven boroughs having less than 5,000 inhabitants and thirty-three with less than 3,000 inhabitants. So their Lordships would see that the conditions in those urban districts were not unlike the conditions in a rural area. On the other hand, take one county alone, the county of Durham, where there were forty-one parishes in rural districts which had populations exceeding 3,000. In those rural districts they would not have the conditions of the &#x00A3;16 limit unless their Lordships agreed to an Amendment; the case would be much the same in a number of colliery or industrial areas, and the general view of the Local Government Board was that it was a classification which it was not very easy to define on the figures before them.</p>

the rural areas would not be affected unless their Lordships agreed to his Amendment. As regards the other districts, figures had been given to various inspectors of the Local Government Board who had to go about the country holding public inquiries with which their Lordships were familiar. In some of those districts the rents for working-class houses varied from &#x00A3;7 16<i>s.</i> to &#x00A3;20 16<i>s</i>., and he would give them in a few moments further particulars with regard to those. In many parishes near London, which were rural districts, the rents were even higher. In Mitcham, for instance, a place which might be familiar to their Lordships, the rents for new working-class dwellings varied from &#x00A3;19 5<i>s.</i> for three rooms to &#x00A3;29 3<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> for five or more rooms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01867"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: That is not an ordinary rural district.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01868"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: No; but he understood that Mitcham was a parish near London which was a rural district. There they had a case of a rural district that had a very high rent. Therefore they saw that the distinction between these districts was artificial. The figures he had quoted were from statistics published by the London County Council. With regard to boroughs or urban districts with a population of less than 50,000, he quoted some figures from a report of an inquiry by the Board of Trade. Rents in those districts ranged from &#x00A3;8 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to &#x00A3;13 13<i>s.</i> for three rooms and from &#x00A3;9 15<i>s.</i> to &#x00A3;19 10<i>s.</i> for four rooms; from &#x00A3;13 to &#x00A3;23 8<i>s.</i> for five rooms, and from &#x00A3;16 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to &#x00A3;28 12<i>s.</i> for six rooms. He would now go back to the question of the rents in rural areas which, under the Bill, their Lordships would only allow to be &#x00A3;8, and which His Majesty's Government wished to be allowed to raise to &#x00A3;16. Take the rural district of Chester-le-Street. There the annual rent for two or three rooms was from &#x00A3;12 7<i>s.</i> to &#x00A3;14 6<i>s.</i>; for three to four rooms from &#x00A3;15 12<i>s.</i> to &#x00A3;16 5<i>s</i>., and for five rooms the annual rent ranged from &#x00A3;18 4<i>s.</i> to &#x00A3;20 16<i>s.</i> Take Hemel Hempstead, a parish in Hertfordshire, which would probably be familiar to the noble Marquess opposite. There the annual rents varied from &#x00A3;7 16<i>s.</i> to &#x00A3;9 2<i>s</i>., and from &#x00A3;13 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to &#x00A3;14 9<i>s.</i></membercontribution></p>

<col>652</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01870"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he thought so. The rents charged for the dwellings in Sevenoaks which were erected by the rural district council ranged from &#x00A3;10 8<i>s.</i> to &#x00A3;13. In Ryhope, for two rooms, the rent was &#x00A3;10 18<i>s</i>., for three rooms &#x00A3;12 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, for four rooms &#x00A3;14 6<i>s</i>., and for five rooms &#x00A3;16 0<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> In Grange-town, a sub-division of that parish, the rent of two rooms was &#x00A3;9 15<i>s.</i>, three rooms &#x00A3;13, four rooms &#x00A3;13 7<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and five rooms &#x00A3;17 9<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> He apologized for troubling their Lordships with these figures, but he thought they went to prove the case that there really was a demand in rural areas for working-class dwellings to be erected which could be let for more than &#x00A3;8. His Majesty's Government therefore trusted that their Lordships would agree to the original suggestion of the Bill and allow the figure &#x00A3;16 to stand, and not agree to the Amendment of the noble Viscount.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01871"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> admitted that the noble Earl had proved the extraordinary variation of rents in rural districts in different parts of the country, and it showed conclusively to his mind how very dangerous a basis for a clause of this kind was the rental. Certainly in the parts of England with which he was best acquainted there was no working man living in a house as defined in this Bill of more than &#x00A3;8 rental in a rural parish; but he quite felt, in the circumstances which the noble Earl had alluded to, that he could not press this Amendment, nor could he stand up for &#x00A3;8 as the figure for rural districts. There had also been a change in the clause by the adoption of the Amendment of the noble Duke behind him. Therefore there was no reason why he should press his Amendment.</p>

house, or part of a house, is let upon the terms that it be put by the lessee or occupying tenant into a condition reasonably fit for occupation." He thought their Lordships would agree that the case for the exclusion of what were commonly called repairing leases had been immensely strengthened by the acceptance of the Amendments moved by the noble Duke, because they had now withdrawn the words "working classes" altogether from the clause, and were merely dealing with houses in urban and rural districts that happened to be rented at comparatively small amounts. When this Bill was in Committee he tried to indicate that in many parts of the country there were a number of small old houses that were taken by individuals on repairing leases, sometimes by members of the working classes themselves. They took these houses at a low rent on condition that they were given a lease, and during the continuance of that lease they agreed to keep the premises in repair. If their Lordships did not pass some proviso such as that which he wished to move they were going to make it impossible for any repairing leases in future to be legal in the case of houses rented at a low rental and covered by this clause. If they did that he contended they would be depriving a good many people of the working classes and others of the opportunity of doing what they thought at all events answered their purpose, which was to lay out a certain amount of money on the repair of houses, and obtaining houses at a low rental on condition that they kept them in repair. Imagine the case of a carpenter or a mason or a tradesman of that sort who had put by a little money and had an opportunity of taking a lease of a cottage. He was a man who by the nature of his craft could at a low expense do the repairs himself, and it was to the advantage of that sort of man that he should in future be allowed to do what he had been allowed to do in the past. If they did not insert a proviso of this kind there would be the same kind of rut as the country had got into in many cases over hard-and-fast building by-laws. What had been the result? Over and over again the by-laws were disregarded and district councils showed favouritism in the case of some owners. The Local Government Board had themselves admitted the evil of this, and he was glad to see that the noble Earl was going to move an Amendment
<col>654</col>
with a view to remedying this abuse. If they did not pass such an Amendment as he now proposed, they would get into exactly the same difficulty. People would evade the law, and although it might be said that there was a remedy, as in the case of the building by-laws, by means of a <i>mandamus,</i> which any ratepayer was entitled to obtain, yet the remedy was scarcely ever heard of and was never used. He hoped their Lordships would allow a certain amount of elasticity in a matter of this kind.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01878"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> was sorry that His Majesty's Government were unable to meet the wishes of the noble Lord now any more than they were able to meet him at the Committee stage. He hoped the noble Lord would forgive him when he said that he could not agree to his parallel between the Amendment suggested and those dealing with the by-laws. He did not think the case was on all fours. The object of this clause was to protect people who were too poor, and very often too illiterate, to protect themselves. There were some people who were quite indifferent about living in insanitary houses, who perhaps enjoyed living in insanitary houses, and they wanted to protect them from having the power of practically contracting themselves out of this Bill, which was a danger to which the Amendment would open the door. The clause as it stood merely reproduced Section 75 of the Act of 1895, and made it apply to houses of a higher rental in accordance with the general scheme of the Bill. Viscount St. Aldwyn had met him so handsomely over the last Amendment that he scarcely liked to quote him against a noble Lord on his own side, but what the noble Viscount said just now struck him very forcibly. Viscount St. Aldwyn said that the rentals which he (Earl Beauchamp) had quoted were not within his own experience in his own neighbourhood. He could not help thinking that through all these discussions on this Bill noble Lords had been apt to consider the circumstances round the houses with which
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0334"/>
<col>655</col>
they themselves were acquainted, and they were not able to project their minds to other parts of the country where all landlords were not as good landlords as most members of their Lordships' House. They had to deal with other districts with which they only became acquainted by reading Blue-books and various literature which dealt with that kind of question. His own experience was that this kind of let was not very common, and he did not think that to prevent it altogether would be a very great hardship. The noble Lord differed from him, and he had no doubt that this kind of let was common and popular in the noble Lord's part of the country. That, however, did not remove the objection of His Majesty's Government, which was that this Amendment would open the door to many abuses. If there were so many exceptional cases where a landlord was unable to afford to put a house in repair and the prospective tenant could afford to do so, the landlord had always the opportunity of borrowing the money from the more fortunate member of the working classes and accept the duty of doing the repairs in the future. He thought it would not be impossible for a landlord to find a way out of the difficulty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01879"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said that if they were to consider their own experiences and relate them he was afraid this debate would last some time. He would be inclined to retort that he doubted if personally the noble Earl was very well acquainted with the habitations of the working classes. The noble Earl spoke as if the Local Government Board had only one idea in their heads&#x2014;the small populations that they desired to deal with. He could quite understand the difficulty His Majesty's Government saw in accepting the Amendment. It might happen under certain circumstances that abuses might occur which the Government were anxious to put an end to, but surely they should find some way of framing their measure so as not to deal with very large areas in the country where the rents were very low and where these abuses did not exist. His Majesty's Government must remember that they were raising the price of the houses. The noble Earl said this was simply re-enacting a section of another Act. It was no such thing. It was enacting a section of another Act with the very great difference that
<col>656</col>
they applied it to a very much better class of house. In his experience it was not an uncommon thing for such a man as the noble Lord had mentioned, a carpenter or a skilled artizan in a country village, to take his house on a lease at a low rental and to agree to do the repairs. It would be an intolerable hardship upon the better class of working man if he was not to have these advantages which he wished for and valued, and which, in his experience, led to no abuses whatever. He trusted that if His Majesty's Government did not accept this Amendment they would at least bring forward some Amendment so as not to put an end altogether to repairing leases in rural districts for houses under &#x00A3;16.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01880"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I ought, no doubt, to say a word in response to the noble Duke's appeal, but I confess I do not see how a clause such as he desires could be framed. I fear I am falling into the trap which Lord Beauchamp pointed out and which affects most of us in this House&#x2014;namely, that we are undoubtedly apt to rely too much on our own immediate experiences. I confess I have not known that it was in any part of England a custom in rural districts for houses at a few shillings a week, which after all is the rent contemplated, to be let on repairing leases, and if it is so I think it is an extremely bad custom. We all know that house property of that kind is not a very valuable possession, and those who have it know it is not a valuable possession on account of the heavy bill for repairs. I am bound to say that if it became the custom for landlords who own cottage property of that kind in small towns and villages to get into the habit of letting it at almost nominal rents in order to get rid of the trouble and the cost of repairs, it would be a very bad thing for the communities concerned, and the probability is that the standard of accommodation would fall greatly in such places. I can conceive it possible, of course, that there is such a case as that mentioned by the noble Duke, where an artizan with a house at 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> a week should undertake to do the repairs, but I should have thought such cases were so rare that it would be hardly worth while attempting to deal with them under the Bill. To accept the Amendment of the noble Lord as it stands must, I think your Lordships will all agree, open the door to very serious danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01881"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said that if they were not to bring their personal experiences

<col>657</col>
to bear he did not see any good in any of their Lordships addressing the House. He had had large experience of this class of leases, and he asked the noble Earl opposite to remember that he was dealing among others with &#x00A3;40 houses in London, and there were a large number of leases of houses of that rental where the tenant undertook to repair the house, both inside and out. It seemed to him there was nothing improper in that kind of case. He quite understood what Earl Beauchamp said when he feared that in some way it might lead to vicious contracting out, and he thought that point ought to be met. Would not the whole point be met if they made this apply to a house which was let on lease for not less than three years? Sometimes these houses were taken on repairing leases for three, four, and five years, but if the Amendment was limited to the case of leases for three years there could not be any vicious contracting out by the working classes. He must say that on principle, where they had a clause which said &#x00A3;40 in London, &#x00A3;26 in boroughs, and &#x00A3;16 in the country, to enact that a house could not be let upon the terms that the tenant should do the repairs was a very startling proposition. He was satisfied that this Amendment would be absolutely necessary to protect hundreds of honest contracts which had been in force for many years with perfect satisfaction to landlords, tenants, and local authorities. Many local authorities supervised houses of from &#x00A3;20 to &#x00A3;25 a year which were let on these terms, and which were used for the purpose of taking in lodgers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01882"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> said he was perfectly willing to accept the suggested amendment of his Amendment by his noble and learned friend. The proviso would then run, "But the condition aforesaid shall not be implied when a house or part of a house is let for a term of not less than three years upon the terms that it be put by the lessee into a condition reasonably fit for occupation."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01883"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member> said he let houses at &#x00A3;20 a year where the tenants did their own repairs, and naturally it was a very onerous thing. He would be prepared, if necessary, to accept the responsibility of having to do them, but the danger he saw was not in the &#x00A3;25 houses. He had known cases where men had lived in hovels and had paid &#x00A3;1 a year.
<col>658</col>
The landlord would say, "You can have that place, but don't bother me, and don't ask me for any repairs." He did not see how they could touch a man of that kind except they proceeded against him under the ordinary Public Health Act, and that would be rather difficult.</p>

He said there might be a case of small importance where a landlord might differ from the local authority. At the same time he might not desire to give way and not wish to have to incur the trouble and publicity of a fight in the County Court. Yet he might desire to find out whether his opinion was right, and so he would probably prefer to go to the Local Government Board. Many of his friends outside their Lordships' House had urged him to bring this Amendment forward. Of course, in any matter of serious disagreement a landlord would go to the County Court. In smaller cases he might say he would not go to that trouble and bother; he would rather pay up and look pleasant.</p>

It was not only in cases of collieries, but collieries had struck him as typical. There might be hundreds of houses and it would be a very serious thing if under this Bill a colliery company could throw on the royalty owner the whole of the responsibility for keeping up the repair of these houses.

He was glad to find he was correct in the opinion he gave off-hand with regard to the specific case mentioned by the noble Duke of houses in a colliery district. The difference between the noble Duke and himself on this point was whether this should apply, as the noble Duke suggested, to a tenant for occupation, or whether, as the Bill suggested, it should apply to tenants for habitation. The definition of landlord which the noble Duke proposed to amend was restricted to persons who let houses under any contract referred to. The noble Duke would see the words in line 42, "In this section the expression 'landlord' means any person who lets the house under any contract referred to in this section, and includes his successor in title, and the expression 'a house' includes part of a house." If the noble Duke would look at the beginning of Clause 15, he would see that the contracts referred to were the same as those referred to in
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0337"/>
<col>661</col>
Clause 14, and in that line 2 of Clause 14 appeared the words "letting for habitation by persons of the working classes." Under those circumstances it was not thought advisable to put in a different definition here, making it a tenant for occupation, when the words were already in the Bill, and covered the case to which the noble Duke referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01905"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said he thought the words "letting for habitation" would still leave the doubt which the noble Duke had raised as to whether a person, say a ground landlord who had let a block of cottages to a company, or a company who had themselves let for habitation or occupation, would be responsible. He did not say what course should be taken, but he did not think that the noble Earl had met the difficulty.</p>

A good deal was said on this point in Committee, and he was afraid even after consideration that the Local Government Board did not like it any better than they did at the time. What was the Order to which the noble Duke referred in his Amendment? The noble Duke seemed to contemplate an Order which should be made after some damage to the house had taken place. As he understood it, there was no question of making an Order in a case like this. The by-laws were made for certain specified purposes as laid down in the Public Health Act, and proceedings for the enforcement of the by-laws might be taken. Therefore no Order would be made by any local authority. He did not like to oppose the noble Duke on a technical point of that kind. This clause met cases of accommodation and various other matters which ought, as a matter of duty, to be imposed upon the landlord.

deprived of water, and there would be no remedy except that of a closing Order. Was not that an inconvenience to every one in the house? If the owner were called upon to repair this defect in the water supply he would say that it must be the fault of the tenant or occupier, and therefore he personally was not responsible. In this case they were dealing with the owners of a class of property which needed to be supervised very carefully, and he did not think it was very unreasonable, subject to notice to the owner of his liabilities, that he should be expected to keep the place in repair himself, however the various defects might have been caused. The landlord had his remedy, which he thought was mentioned in Committee by the noble Duke, which was afforded by the ordinary law. Nothing deprived the owner of that remedy, but His Majesty's Government did not think it necessary to relieve him from the liability of keeping the houses in habitable repair.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01934"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> pointed out that one of the subsequent Amendments standing in the name of the Lord Steward was more than a matter of drafting. On his motion in Committee words were inserted in the Bill that it should be the duty of the "local authority" to define the requirements necessary, and in his Amendment the Lord Steward proposed to leave out the words "local authority." He attached importance to them, and in due course would move to insert them again, so that the clause would read that the regulations be made by "the local authority with the consent of the Local Government Board."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01935"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member> said it appeared to him that the effect of the Amendments proposed was to give power to the Local Government Board to replace paragraphs which had been struck out in Committee. When they came to look at those paragraphs, it seemed that the framer of them had apparently walked down a street and looked at the front of the houses only. Had he taken the trouble to look behind them he would have seen that a large number of the houses in London were built very much in the shape of the letter L, the front of the houses representing the vertical part of that letter facing the street, and the part represented by the horizontal part of the letter L running very far back. In many of such houses, although the lighting might not always be good, large skylights were provided; they contained plenty of fireplaces, and were well ventilated and as healthy places as could be, and yet he was afraid they would be ruled out under the clauses of the Bill if it was intended to restore power to the Local Government Board to make regulations. One of the proposed regulations was to the effect that windows must be provided equal to one-tenth of the floor area of the room. One way of ful-
<col>666</col>
filling that clause would be by building a partition across a room and so reducing the cubic space the occupant had hitherto enjoyed, and he was afraid of that clause coming back again as part of the regulations of the Local Government Board. Then there were a large number of men servants occupying rooms on the ground floor of a great many houses in London, and it would be impossible to alter many of those houses in order to make the rooms comply with the regulations. This would mean that many butlers and men servants would have to be discharged, and many of such houses, particularly in the West End, that were now protected by the custodians who slept on the ground floor, and who had the safety of a good deal of property dependent on them, would now be deprived of that protection. He really thought that the clauses must have been inspired in the mind either of the noble Earl opposite or the President of the Local Government Board by their having received, without recognising them, a deputation of burglars, not of the ugly "Bill Sykes" type, but of the more civilised "Raffles" pattern. He thought that any such regulations would be better left to local authorities than to the Local Government Board. He had no doubt that the noble Earl opposite would say that these paragraphs were exactly in the interest of the butlers and men servants, and that it was not right that they should inhabit such rooms as he was thinking of. No doubt that might be so in some cases, but at the same time he hoped the Government would take into consideration that rooms can be ventilated by skylights as well as by windows and whether they were not doing more harm than good by exposing such men to the probability of dismissal because of their being of no further use in the way of safeguarding property.</p>

He attached importance to the point for the reasons just stated by his noble friend behind him. The proposals with reference to areas and everything of that kind as they originally stood in the Bill seemed to him almost absurd, and he had no confidence whatever in leaving such matters to be settled by the Local Government Board. It was a matter which the local authority ought to deal with in the area which it governed with reference to the needs and conditions of that particular area. It was right that the Local Government Board should approve, but he thought that the local authority should initiate.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01942"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member> asked whether the habitual interpretation of the word "lighted" meant lighted by daylight or in an artificial way, because of course that would make enormous difference to the practical working of the clause and the character of the accommodation secured.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01943"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought that generally speaking "lighted" certainly referred to lighting by day. He had in mind a house in Grosvenor-square&#x2014;he was afraid it was a personal experience&#x2014;where the footmen's rooms entered on to the kitchen passage and there was no ventilation or daylight of any sort or kind, not even a window. Clearly that was not a room which was lighted. With regard to the Amendment of the noble Viscount, it appeared to the Local Government Board that these were matters where it was desirable that the regulations should be on one general scale throughout the whole of the country, and in dealing with rooms of the kind in question a great deal of inconvenience would be caused by the possibility suggested by the noble Viscount. Not only great inconvenience, but great uncertainty and dissatisfaction would exist
<col>668</col>
if local authorities imposed different regulations in different places. It was the opinion of the Local Government Board that the Amendment as put down in his name really met the case better than the new Amendment of the noble Viscount, and although he did not propose to divide the House he ventured to hope their Lordships would agree to leave the Bill as amended by him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01944"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> suggested that there really were very different conditions obtaining in different parts of the country. The clause as it originally stood might be not unfairly applicable to a very large number of towns, but it would work extreme hardship in the county of London, and it was mainly because of that that it was objected to on that side of the House. What might be good in Liverpool or Leeds or Glasgow might be highly unsuitable in London, and he was of opinion that elasticity in such matters was extremely desirable. The noble Earl no doubt was perfectly well aware that there were regulations already in existence in London dealing with the matter, but the trouble was in the case of a room underground which was occupied along with another room over-ground. They were unable under the existing law to get at the occupier. He would use the room above the ground as a workshop because he must have light for his work and the room underground to sleep in because light was not so necessary in a sleeping room as in a working room, and thus evaded the law. He therefore hoped the House would not accept the Amendment of the noble Earl but would accept that of the noble Viscount.</p>

He thought the advantages must be balanced one against the other. His Majesty's Government were of opinion that the Bill as it stood, which prevented such a room from being used for human habitation either during the day or during the night, possessed the balance of advantage, leaving it still possible for the room to be used as a store room or a wine cellar.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01952"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST.

Courts they would have some difficulty in interpreting it because subsection (7) said that, a room habitually used as a sleeping place should be deemed to be a dwelling house. Those words were put in in the House of Commons. The fact of the matter was that a room habitually used as a sleeping place, however unfit it might be, must be declared to be "a dwelling house unfit for human habitation" before they could get an order to close. He did not know whether, where a room contravened the provisions, they were going to get a closing order for the whole of the house or not. If it applied to the room only he certainly thought the Bill ought to say it somewhere, and if it did not he did not see how the Amendment applied.</p>

There were numbers of purposes for which such rooms might be properly used; they might be turned into bathrooms, for example.

At the same time it is fair to point out that all that is required to be done is to make the room free front dampness and effluvia and to see that it is sufficiently ventilated and properly lighted. There must be a great many cases in which it would be most dangerous to allow a room to be used which complied with none of those provisions. We shall have to consider, therefore, whether we can meet the point raised by the noble Duke without opening the rather dangerous possibility of allowing rooms which are thoroughly insanitary in every respect to be inhabited all day for purposes of work.</membercontribution></p>

penses of a local authority in the execution of that part of the Act should be defrayed as provided in the principal Act of 1890, and he was certainly under the impression that the noble Earl, on behalf of the Government, had promised to reconsider the question and bring it up on Report. Under the Act of 1890 the expenses of the local authority were defrayed as special expenses and under the Bill they were to be defrayed as general expenses. Special expenses were defrayed upon one-fourth only of the rateable value of certain specified subjects, but the general expenses were charged upon the whole rateable value of the authority. The specified subjects were land and land covered by water, canals, and towing paths, tithes and the permanent way of a railway. Those had all had the benefit of the one-fourth classification up to the present time for the reason which had constantly been stated&#x2014;that they did not get the same benefit out of the expenditure under the Public Health Acts; and it appeared to him that a change ought not to be made in the system of rating without some reason being adduced for it. He thought that no reason was given in the course of the Committee debate except that His Majesty's Government wished the expenses to be levied not over a contributory district but over a whole area.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01970"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the question for their Lordships was who benefited supposing the expenses were charged as special expenses. If charged as special expenses they were paid out of a rate towards which land and railways contributed only upon one-fourth of their value. Under the Bill land and railways very largely created the demand for houses, and as they were benefited by the houses His Majesty's Government did not think it fair that they should be exempted as regards three-fourths of the expenditure. It was the opinion of the Government that the expenses should be paid as general expenses; that was to say, out of the poor rate to which land other than agricultural
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0343"/>

land contributed in full and to which agricultural land contributed only one half.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01971"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said he did not know anything about rail-ways, but he thought it very hard that railways in agricultural districts should be called upon so largely as they were under the Bill. His own county of Northumberland was entirely agricultural and very thinly populated in one part, while in another part it was entirely manufacturing and very thickly populated, and he would ask why the agricultural centres should have to contribute towards the cost of meeting the demand for houses which manufacturing towns in one corner of the county created.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01972"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> regretted that the noble Lord who moved the Amendment did not go a great deal further and take exception to the expenses of a scheme being paid by the whole of a rural district. In some parishes people had built cottages which was in excellent condition and there were sufficient accommodation, whereas in another part of the same rural district there were other parishes where no one had done anything. Was it not monstrous that those people who had done their duty and spent money in providing houses should be rated to supply the deficiency in areas which had not done their duty? The only reason was that they were afraid of placing a heavy rate upon those parishes where great outlay was required, and they were going to make all the rest of the district pay for the shortcomings of a small portion of it. He thought the matter was a very serious one, and it might be necessary for him to move an Amendment on Third Reading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01973"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member> considered it very unfair on railways to levy a rate on their full value in order to supply housing accommodation for parishes which lay off the route of the railway. Where a railway ran through one thickly-populated area it ran through, perhaps, ten or twelve that were thinly populated, and it was very hard on them to be called upon to subscribe towards housing accommodation in distant parts of their area. Railways are always looked upon as very fair game for taxation. In his own, parish the railway paid one-third of the rates, and at the time of her late lamented Majesty's Jubilee a rate was levied on the parish to celebrate that great event, and in spite of protest on the part
<col>674</col>
of the railway authorities they found themselves involved in a rate to pay for the oranges and buns supplied to the village children. He thought it should be recognised that railways had done their duty in providing cottages for workpeople, especially in rural districts, and he hoped it would not be used as an argument for putting further expenditure upon them that they had done so much to meet their proper duties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01974"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me that the question is not such a burning one as noble Lords who have argued for the Amendment appear to think, because the clause provides for each case being considered on its merits, and where it can be shown that the benefit attaches to one district only, that district can be made to pay. That seems to be the common sense solution of the question, and I am afraid it will be found that the preference given to agricultural land and to railways under the Amendment as suggested by the noble Lord will not all over the country be considered a fair one.

Viscount St. Aldwyn moved that in calling upon a local authority to provide accommodation for the working classes the Local Government Board were to take into consideration the various circumstances, including the probable effect upon the rates, and the noble Viscount thought that that would sufficiently safeguard the ratepayers against the provision of housing accommodation for those who were not strictly of the working classes.

Their Lordships had heard a good deal about the definition of "working classes," and he thought it was the intention of the House that some definition of "working classes" should be inserted in the Bill, and that so far as possible the application of the Acts should be in the interests of those classes primarily if not solely. He had the honour of being for some time a member of the London County Council, and he confessed that during those years he was very greatly struck by the class of persons who inhabited the dwellings that were put up at the expense of the ratepayers. Their Lordships would naturally suppose where a displacement took place that the new buildings would be inhabited by the persons who had been displaced. That was not the case; an extraordinarily small proportion of those displaced found room in the new buildings. To some extent no doubt that was owing to the, fact that the buildings had to be erected in close proximity to the place where the displacement occurred, which was usually a crowded
<col>676</col>
area either in the centre of London or in other great towns. It was precisely in those crowded areas that the value of land was highest and therefore the cost was greatest. The consequence was that the London County Council had to charge very high rents in order that the ratepayers might not suffer severely by the housing operations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01981">From a return made every year by the London County Council of those accommodated in the Council's dwellings, he found that no less than 356 clerks, a large number of insurance agents, musicians and policemen, and eleven managers of public-houses lodged in County Council dwellings. They had heard the clerk described as the black-coated working man, and he was not at all sure that that was not a very accurate description; but the result of the present state of things was that there was a very strong feeling in the minds of poor people, especially in the East End of London, that the municipal dwellings were not pro-provided for them to live in, and they had to go into other slums perhaps worse than those from which they had been displaced. He asked that preference should be given to persons of the working classes as far as practicable. He said as far as practicable because there might be cases where it was impossible to find persons, strictly speaking, of the working classes to occupy the whole of the rooms, and he would be the last to put a charge on the ratepayers by saying that because persons of the working class could not be found that therefore the rooms were to be left absolutely untenanted. He was told that the rule was always first come first served with regard to those applying for accommodation, and that no inquiry whatever was made as to whether the applicant was of the working class but only whether he could afford to pay the comparatively high rent. Another grievance, and one very acutely felt, was that a great deal of the accommodation was given to those who were not of British nationality, and he thought it should be the duty of the local authority to give the preference to men of the working classes of British origin. He also thought that there should be a register available at all times to those who cared to inspect it showing what accommodation was vacant.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01983"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that the figures mentioned by the noble Earl involved a considerable number of rooms. Up to the end of December, 1906, there were no fewer than 145,000 rooms provided in London, and the proportion of managers of public-houses was not very large when they divided eleven amongst 145,000. If there was a feeling on the part of the working classes in the East End of London that there was an insufficiency of accommodation for them that was a sound argument for encouraging the London County Council to pursue the policy of housing accommodation and to build a great deal more largely in future than they had done in the past. As to the keeping of a register, local authorities naturally would wish to let their houses and the list would be at the disposal of any one. He would venture to repeat a question he put before in Committee, whether it was not a great deal better for the ratepayers that those dwellings should be occupied by somebody even if not by people strictly of the working classes than that they should be left empty, therefore imposing a still further charge upon the rates.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01984"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> said they had heard an extraordinary defence of the Bill as it stood. The noble Earl said it seemed to him that the London County Council had not kept pace with the times in building. He did not know on what that statement rested when they were told by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, that the occupants of these houses were very largely persons who did not belong to the labouring classes. Did he mean that the London
<col>678</col>
County Council would be justified in going on building houses without end at the expense of the ratepayers? Surely the eleven publicans who were spoken of were never intended to be housed at the expense of the ratepayers. Some representatives of the City of Edinburgh had told him a few days ago that exactly the same thing had happened there; that the houses they had built under their Housing Act were mainly occupied by persons quite of a superior class. They now asked, "How long is this to go on? Now that the houses which we have built are occupied by persons of a class quite superior to labourers, are we to have a new scheme and are we to go on building at the expense of the ratepayers?" He therefore supported the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01985"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> very much doubted whether the Amendment would have much practical effect, because the noble Earl had found it necessary to insert the words "as far as practicable." They must all feel, as the noble Earl the Lord Steward had said, that if members of the working classes could not be found to inhabit the houses, they must, in the interests of the ratepayers, be let to somebody else. But surely the local authority, having at the expense of the ratepayers erected houses for the working classes, ought to try and secure that they should be occupied by persons who were members of the working classes. That, he thought, was a very reasonable proposition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01986"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am in some agreement with the noble Viscount who has just sat down&#x2014;namely, that this provision, if your Lordships insert it in the Bill, will not have a very far-reaching effect. If it really be the fact that local authorities by deliberate preference let their rooms and their houses to persons who do not belong to the working classes, it seems to me very difficult to alter that except by appealing to them and convincing, for instance, such bodies as the great councils of London and other towns that those are not the purposes for which the houses were intended.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01987"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> pointed out that what he had said was that they let them to the first comer whoever he was; his object was to seek to impose a duty upon them to find out whether the first

<p id="S5LV0003P0-01988"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the Lord Chairman is rather sanguine in proposing to insert a provision of that kind in an Act of Parliament. We return again, of course, to a definition of the working classes, as to which, I suppose, he and I are not in complete agreement. I confess I do not see what reason of public policy there is if you are going to build houses for anybody that should make it more to the public benefit to build houses to be occupied by a mechanic than to be occupied by a clerk. Both have their business in the neighbourhood of the place in which the houses are built, and I confess I have never heard any attempt yet made to show why you should build a house for one and not for the other. I can understand the attitude of mind which says that no houses should be built by local authorities at all and that the work should be left entirely to private enterprise, and I can understand the attitude of mind which says&#x2014;and I could indeed agree with the proposition&#x2014;that the local authorities should not build houses of high value as a speculation; but to suppose that you can usefully go beyond the general test of the cheapness of the house is a thing which I regard as impracticable. With regard to the attempt to amend the Alien Act, which I think is what the noble Earl is attempting to do, there again I do not think his provision is of a really serviceable character. It is also, I think, of a rather invidious nature in itself, and I confess I should be sorry to see it inserted in the Bill; but I gather that the Amendment has the approbation of noble Lords opposite, and therefore I will say no more.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01989"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am glad the noble Earl shows a somewhat relenting frame of mind with regard to this Amendment, in favour of which there is a great deal to be said. I rather think his attitude is that the addition of this clause would be superfluous, but I venture to tell the noble Earl why I think it would be politic to add this clause to the Bill. In the first place, it seems to me that its insertion would have a very reassuring effect on the public mind. There are two classes of persons who need to be reassured. Firstly,
<col>680</col>
among the ratepayers there is a general feeling that their money is very often applied to purposes other than those they would desire it to be applied to. They think that buildings erected ostensibly for the benefit of the working classes are really being devoted to another purpose altogether. Then there comes the case of the working classes themselves. I was much impressed by what was said by my noble friend the Lord Chairman. He told us that one of the results of these buildings being frequently occupied by people who did not belong to the working classes was that the working classes, properly so called, were deterred from inhabiting them, and I believe there is a great deal in that argument. While the words of the new clause would be quite innocuous they would probably have a very reassuring effect in a quarter where some reassurance is really called for.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01990"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I did not make myself quite clear if the noble Marquess thinks I am disposed to accept the Amendment, because read with the definition of "working classes" it seems to limit to a very undesirable extent the class of person who can inhabit these houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-01991"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Then I think there is a difference of opinion between us, because in my view these houses put up for the working classes should be available for habitation only by people who are members of the working classes.

As he understood, it was the desire of His Majesty's Government to define working classes by saying "What kind of house do you live in, and what rent do you pay for it?"

We understood that the noble Duke's object was to widen the definition and bring it more into conformity with our view, which is that it is impossible to find any set of words which will cover all the people whom you may desire to describe as the working classes for this particular purpose of housing. The noble Duke spoke of a wage limit, but, as I pointed out at a previous stage, the definition as inserted here admits a mechanic earning, perhaps, &#x00A3;6 or &#x00A3;8 a week, but excludes a typist earning 35<i>s.</i> That seems to me to be an absurd result, and I cannot believe that it is intended by those who support this Amendment. A large number of parallel cases might be found, and there is the whole class of clerks who seem to me to have as perfect a right to be housed as anybody else.

I suppose to the local authority or the Local Government Board, or both. My noble friend proposes that you should be allowed to deal with land "required" in order to further such development. But it must be so required in someone's opinion. The two forms do not greatly differ in substance.

Under those circumstances he moved this Amendment, and if noble Lords desired any further explanation of the subsequent Amendment he would be happy to give it.</p>

<col>690</col>
the clause. He thought it might, perhaps, avoid an amendment at a future stage. He understood that where a scheme was in the area of two authorities, either one authority might make the scheme or they might make a joint scheme. What he would like to ask was, As the Bill stood would not the one authority be able to make the scheme even in the case where the other local authority was perfectly willing to do their share in carrying out the scheme? One did not see why an authority should be able to go into the area of another authority to make a scheme in a case where that other authority was willing to act. It seemed to him that the clause required words to provide that the one authority should only act in respect of any land within the area of another authority if the other authority were not prepared themselves to carry out the town-planning scheme for that area. They could both, of course, act together in a joint scheme; but it did not seem to be proper for the one authority to act in the two areas, although the other was willing to act in its own area.</p>

<quote>"(3) Where, by the making of any town planning scheme, any property is increased in value the responsible authority, if they make a claim for the purpose within the time (if any) limited by the scheme, not being less than three months after the date when notice of the confirmation of the scheme is first published in the manner prescribed by regulations made by the Local Government Board, shall be entitled to recover from any person whose property is so increased in value the amount of that increase."</quote>
to leave out the words "the amount of that increase," and to insert "such proportion of their expenditure as failing agreement in the opinion of the arbitrator has increased the value of such property." He said the Amendment was a very important one, because it contained a definition of what betterment was to be. But for the sake of clearness he wished to make a verbal alteration in the Amendment, so that it should read: "Such proportion of the expenditure of the authority as failing agreement," and so forth. Their Lordships would remember that on the Committee stage he drew attention to the words in the Bill which provided that in the case of a town-planning scheme any increase of value which arose in any property in consequence of the scheme should belong to the local authority. He thought there was a general agreement that the words as they stood in the Bill could not pass. He did not think that was questioned in any quarter. He did not believe the Government questioned it, and he knew noble Lords behind them did not. Therefore some Amendment was required. The Amendment he had put down contained, he believed, the fairest method of dealing with the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02069">The effect of the Amendment was this. The local authority had been put to certain expenditure in carrying out their town-planning scheme, the result being to benefit certain classes of property. It seemed quite clear that if that were the case the whole of the expenditure should be reimbursed to the local authority by
<col>692</col>
those persons who had benefited by it. The words of the Amendment were drawn so as to give a certain elasticity and to leave it to the arbitrator to assign it between different owners of property as might be thought just; or there might be an occasion when the benefit was so obviously greater to the public than to the owner that only a small portion ought to be charged to the owner; but whatever increase might be said to have accrued to the owner's property, to that extent he must reimburse the local authority for the expenditure to which they had been put. That seemed to him to be perfectly fair. Some members of their Lordships' House might ask, What advantage, then, had the local authority got by making the town-planning scheme? They got two advantages. In the first place, they got the very special advantage, which all administrators ought to desire, that they increased the prosperity of the locality over which they had jurisdiction. That was what they existed for, and that was what they were elected for. The other advantage they got was a substantial pecuniary one&#x2014;namely, a large increase in the rateable value of the district from which they derived their income. It was quite clear that if the result of a town-planning scheme was to raise the value of a particular owner's property it would not only benefit the owner but would also benefit the authority, because the rating value would increase in exactly the same proportion, and a large pecuniary gain would result to the rating authority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02070">Those being the main arguments, he submitted the clause as a perfectly watertight clause to their Lordships' consideration. It went upon a definite, fixed, and comprehensible principle. There was nothing arbitrary about it, and it was perfectly simple. A local authority put to certain expense were reimbursed that expense if it could be fairly charged as an advantage to particular individuals. The noble Earl the Lord Steward had an alternative proposal; he proposed that they should, as it were, cut the Gordian knot by arbitrary division of the increment into two parts, giving one to the owners and the other to the local authority. Of course, the noble Earl would understand him when he said there could be no defence to such a proposal. There could be no defence because there was no particular merit in one half one way or the other. It might be too great in one
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0353"/>
<col>693</col>
case and a great deal too little in another. It was evidently a proposition very difficult to defend. It was not the occasion or the time of night to go into elaborate considerations even if he were capable of doing it, but it might, he thought, be easily shown that an arbitrary distinction of that kind could not be made. He still submitted that his proposal was the right solution of this difficult point.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02072"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think we all agreed when discussing this question before that it was one of marked difficulty, but the noble Marquess has, if he will forgive me saying so, solved the difficulty by evading it altogether and simply by taking nothing whatever in respect of betterment. Surely it must be that if anything is to be charged in respect of betterment the amount expended by the local authority, which, after all is a pure accident, ought not to be the governing factor in estimating that betterment. You can conceive a great number of cases where a man's property&#x2014;in fact, everybody's property concerned in the scheme&#x2014;may be very slightly benefited by a most expensive operation on the part of the local authority. On the other hand, you can imagine cases where a comparatively small expenditure on the part of the local authority would appreciate to a vast extent certain lands belonging to a particular owner. Yet, under the proposition of the noble Marquess, the owner in the first case might have to pay a considerable sum, and in the second case the man whose property was vastly benefited might get off by scarcely paying anything whatever. The noble Marquess and the House must bear in mind what the proposition is. The noble Marquess himself used the word "increment"; we have to bear in mind that it is not the increment in land which is to be charged for this purpose. All you can charge is what is actually due to the scheme. Now what in a case of such a kind is actually due to the scheme? It would be usual, I suppose, when the question was under consideration for an owner of land to go before the tribunal and point out that as a matter of fact, although
<col>694</col>
the scheme had opened up his land, it had been of comparatively little advantage to him. The noble Marquess on the Committee stage mentioned the case of some land near the seaside which had an agricultural value of &#x00A3;100 an acre which value was increased to &#x00A3;500 an acre by a small operation of road-making on the part of a particular local authority, and he inferred from this that the whole of the &#x00A3;400 betterment would be taken by the local authority; but, surely it is hardly conceivable that the whole of the increase could be caused by the act of the local authority in making the scheme. I find it very difficult to conceive such a case. Supposing there was a land-owner whose land was between the site in question and a railway station or a main road, it is evident that unless the intervening landowner was a person of an extraordinary character he could be what is commonly called "squared" by very much less than the amount which the local authority, according to the noble Marquess, would claim under the scheme; and, therefore I think it will be found if you examine closely into all possible cases that the amounts which could be fairly set down by an arbitrator as payable in respect of the scheme would be infinitely less than at first sight one would be disposed to imagine. I confess that when I first looked into the matter I did think that such cases as the noble Marquess indicated would be possible under the clause, but when one considers that the only sum which is chargeable is the difference between what the land would be worth at a particular moment, on the one hand with the scheme and on the other hand without the scheme, the amounts cannot, I think, be very large. The noble Marquess asks why we fixed on one-half as a maximum. It is, of course, always a very easy question to ask why one has fixed on a particular figure for a particular purpose. It does seem to us that there are cases in which the local authority might fairly claim as much as one-half; and in those circumstances, feeling, as I said at first, that the suggestion of the noble Marquess really evades the point at issue because it allows for nothing but, so to speak, the out-of-pocket expenses of the local authority, I am afraid we cannot agree to the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02073"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said it was impossible to discuss this Amendment without comparing it with the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0354"/>
<col>695</col>
alternative Amendment proposed on behalf of His Majesty's Government. He thought, with profound deference, that if they were thinking of the owner of a private property he would possibly have to pay more under the Amendment of the noble Marquess than under the alternative proposed by the Government, because under the latter, at all events, what he would have to pay would be limited to half the amount of the increased value. If, for example, a great town-planning scheme cost &#x00A3;20,000 and the effect of that was to raise the value of certain property belonging to A by, say, &#x00A3;800, the arbitrator had to say how much of the &#x00A3;800 ought to be paid back again to reimburse the local authority for the expenditure which had caused the increase in the value. There was an existing practice in the case of county councils when levying an expenditure over a portion of their area which was supposed to be particularly benefited, to say that that particular area was to pay three-fourths of the expenditure and the remainder of the county one-fourth. That, possibly, might be a precedent in the arbitrator's mind for awarding three-fourths of the increased value instead of one-half.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02074"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> reminded the noble Lord that what the Government proposed to do was first of all to take half of the improvement and then charge increment duty on the remainder.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02075"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said that as he had had to deal with this question hundreds of times, might he point out that the only logical course was that suggested by the noble Marquess. They were not considering the taxation of increment value or the putting on of land tax, but how much ought to be paid because a man's property was benefited by a particular improvement called a town-planning scheme. That kind of question had been considered by skilled arbitrators for many years. The Government without giving the slightest reason said that half the increased value was to go into the pocket of the local authority. Why? Nobody could suggest why one-half more than 10 per cent. He turned to the scheme of the noble Marquess. The local authority in the course of a town-planning scheme had made a road at a cost, say, of &#x00A3;1,000. The arbitrator would say, "This road has been made by a paramount authority, and this particular owner has got the benefit
<col>696</col>
of it. He would have made the road if he could, but he could not get the consent of other owners or had not the money to do it. The result is that that particular expenditure has led to the improvement of his property. How much ought he to contribute towards the outlay?" The noble Earl said that was not betterment at all. He (Lord Alverstone) said with great deference, having studied the subject for years, that it was the true and right measure of betterment. Now what would the problem be? The arbitrator would say, "I find an acre of this land has been improved&#x2014;or it may be three or four acres&#x2014;because of the particular road, and that so much of the value which has been added ought to be borne by the landowner." But, as the noble Marquess had pointed out, the circumstances might be so various and the amount of land which benefited might be so uncertain that nobody could predict what the increased value would be. The Leader of the House solved the question by saying it would be very small, and that he could not conceive any harm. How could the noble Earl possibly say? It was an injustice to the local authority. If the local authority had spent X pounds and that had improved the property of A, B, C, and D round the planning scheme, the expense of the local authority ought to be borne by the owners in such proportion as the arbitrator thought just. He was quite satisfied that from the point of view of justice both to the local authority and the land owner the scheme of the noble Marquess was the only one that could be accepted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02076"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The question here is whether the charge ought to be measured by the sacrifice made by the local authority or by the advantage derived by the owner. There are precedents for the adoption of the latter standard. If I remember aright, in several private Bills for London there was a provision made for betterment&#x2014;betterment measured, I think, not by the expenditure, which is quite an unpractical method, but measured by the profit of the owner.</membercontribution></p>

any property is increased in value," but their Lordships substituted the word "making" for the word "operation." He could imagine a scheme causing certain properties to rise immediately in value, and if the Amendment of the noble Marquess were carried it seemed to him that the local authority would get nothing whatever out of any kind of improvements to such property. There was a difference between the making of a scheme and the operation of a scheme. The latter would include improvements on which money was spent, but the very making of a scheme might quite conceivably raise the value of certain kinds of property all round a town.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02079"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said the right rev.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02099"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member> moved to delete from subsection (2) of Clause 60 the words "so as to give rise to any claim for compensation under this part of this Act." He said he had another Amendment on the Paper, and as the two referred to the same matter they should be considered together. The second Amendment was to insert at the end of subsection (2) the following&#x2014;"provided that if it shall appear to the arbitrator that such provisions are unusual and impose excessive restrictions upon the use of the property, and that under all the circumstances compensation should be awarded he may, notwithstanding anything in this subsection contained, award such compensation as he may think just." If their Lordships referred to the subsection in question they would notice that it sought to impose on owners of land conditions which were burdensome, excessive, and very arbitrary. When the Bill was under consideration in Committee he moved to delete subsection (2) of this clause, but in deference to Viscount St. Aldwyn, as well as to the lateness of the hour, he withdrew the Amendment in order to save the trouble of a Division. Careful examination of the subsection would show their Lordships, however, that the conditions it contained were very dangerous and far-reaching in character. When this
<col>700</col>
clause was brought up in another place, it was passed under the closure resolution proposed by His Majesty's Government and the House had no opportunity of discussing it. Then the clause came up to their Lordships' House, and again by a misfortune it passed through the Committee stage without any discussion upon it. Therefore he felt that before the Report stage was concluded their Lordships should be given an opportunity of expressing an opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02100">He would add a word in explanation of the object of the Amendment. He did not say it would be necessary on all occasions to pay compensation to the landowner, but if certain circumstances arose which, in the opinion of the arbitrator, demanded that compensation should be given, the Bill should provide for it to be given. When their Lordships reflected that the subsection gave power to prescribe the space about buildings, and to limit the number, or height, or character of buildings, he felt sure they would say that it should not be passed without some promise from His Majesty's Government that it would be modified either now or on the Third Reading. It appeared to him that under the Bill they might very easily deprive an owner of the whole or the greater part of his property without giving him a chance of getting one penny of compensation. They had not heard the view of the Government on the question, and he hoped the noble Earl would be able to give an assurance that this very drastic subsection would be modified.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02102"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> was sure noble Lords opposite would be as much surprised as he had been to hear from the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, that a landowner might have his property taken from him under the provisions of the Bill without compensation being awarded. The various provisions introduced into the Bill by noble Lords opposite, quite apart from provisions which His Majesty's Government had always intended should be in the Bill, he was sure, made such a state of things impossible. He thought the Amendment of the noble Earl would go rather further than the mover himself expected, because power
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0357"/>
<col>701</col>
would be given to an arbitrator to vary a scheme to which no objection had been taken by the authority or the person interested, and which had been confirmed by the Local Government Board. The adoption of the noble Earl's proposal might have curious results. An owner might not have asked for compensation, and might not even think that he was deserving of compensation, and yet if in the opinion of the arbitrator it was a case in which compensation should be paid the arbitrator might give the owner compensation. Again, if a scheme had been confirmed by Parliament after a full consideration of all the facts by a Select Committee, the arbitrator might, despite the fact that the Select Committee had said nothing about compensation, go behind the Act of Parliament and award compensation. Their Lordships, he thought, were hardly likely to adopt a course which would give an arbitrator power to go behind an Act of Parliament or a Select Committee. To embark on such a course would be dangerous and they had better avoid it altogether.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02103"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> wished to know whether what the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, had said was quite the case. The clause said, "Property shall not be deemed to be injuriously affected so as to give rise to any claim for compensation under this Part of this Act." Therefore the compensation must be under the provisions of the Bill, and the Bill said that Parliament by means of a Provisional Order, or the Local Government Board, as the case might be, was to decide the claim. He did not think it was true to say, therefore, that under the Amendment of his noble friend it would be possible for an arbitrator to give compensation in spite of no compensation having been awarded by a Provisional Order. He would like to hear a legal opinion on that point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02104"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought their Lordships must read both Amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, together. If they did so they would see that what he had said respecting the power that would be given to the arbitrator became quite possible.</p>

He said the noble Marquess, having to leave the House, had asked him to take charge of this Amendment, the object of which was plain on the face of it. Perhaps noble Lords on the Government bench might feel some surprise that such an Amendment should be brought forward I on that side of the House. The Amendment was a form of applying "ginger," because it provided that where a local authority had refused to proceed with an order the Local Government Board might act in place of the authority and do all that was necessary. It was further provided that a Committee of either House of Parliament might award costs against the local authority or to the local authority. Without this new subsection the Amendment of Earl Cawdor might be rendered absolutely nugatory if a local authority refused to proceed with an order.</p>

which had been of great use to the House and who had proved a courteous opponent to noble Lords on the Government side. As to proceeding further with the Amendments, he would point out that they had now dealt with most of the matters of importance and there was very little remaining to be done. Under the circumstances they might, if noble Lords opposite agreed to it, take the exceptional course of deferring any Amendments of substance till the Third Reading of the Bill and deal now only with the drafting Amendments, which would take off the Paper a large number of the Amendments still remaining to be gone through. With regard to the new subsection now under consideration, he might say that noble Lords on the Government side were naturally rather surprised that such an Amendment should come from the Opposition. He was informed that the Local Government Board did not desire the power which would be conferred upon it by the Amendment. The preparation of a scheme involving repeated conferences with landowners and others in a locality could be properly undertaken only by an authority on the spot. If the Local Government Board were to undertake the work they would require to have a special staff whose duty it would be to investigate all the local circumstances and to consult with people regarding the promotion of town-planning schemes. Procedure of that kind would be very expensive and probably much less satisfactory than if the matter were carried out by the local authority. Therefore he hoped the Amendment would not be pressed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02118"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said the Government's objection to the Amendment was that the word "houses" which the noble Viscount had put in was thought to be so wide as to prevent the responsible authority being compelled to erect a town hall, or even an office for the surveyor or inspector under the scheme. While the Amendment was open to the objection he had indicated, he realised that it was undesirable for the provisions of the Bill to be so interpreted that there would be no work which the responsible authority might not be compelled to undertake. He felt at a disadvantage in discussing the Amendment at that late hour, and if the noble Viscount thought there was some substance in it perhaps he would raise the matter again on the Third Reading.

He said that this subsection dealt with the district medical officers of health who were whole-timers and not with those who only gave half their time. The county medical officers of health were put on quite a different footing from the district medical officers. The Government inserted a clause giving security of tenure

to county medical officers, and in his remarks on the Second Reading of the Bill he thought the noble Earl made out a very good case why the district medical officers of health should have the protection which they asked for. He could imagine that the noble Earl would express sympathy with the Amendment, but would say that it was impossible to accept it because it was out of order, If their Lordships looked at subsections (2), (3), and (4), however, they would see that references were made there to district medical officers of health. He was told that the Government proposed to bring in a Bill next session to deal with the whole question, but the present President of the Local Government Board might not be in office next year and even if he were there might not be time available to pass a Bill. He therefore urged the noble Earl to accept this subsection which met with the approval of the Opposition. He had hoped that his noble friend, Lord Belper, the representative of the Association of County Councils, would have supported him that night. Though he had not that assistance, as noble Lords on the Opposition side were ready to afford district medical officers of health the protection which they sought, not only in their own interests but in the public interest, he hoped the Government might be able to see their way to accept the subsection.</p>

The clause as it stood obliged a county council to appoint a special committee for the purposes of the Act. Of course all were agreed that a committee must be appointed, but in the case of many county councils a committee took up two branches of work. For instance, in the county council over which he had the honour to preside they had for years had a Property and Sanitation Committee. The sanitation duties of that committee were such as' were described under this Bill and would doubtless be accepted as satisfying its provisions, but it combined the business of looking after the property of the county as well. It had been found convenient to refer both subjects to one committee and he could not think there was any object to be gained in binding a county council to appoint a special committee for the single purpose of exercising their duties under the provisions of this Bill. Under the old Small Holdings Act and Allotments Act a county council had to appoint two committees, one for small holdings and another for allotments. That was found to be a very inconvenient procedure, and in the same way he believed it would be found very inconvenient were the county councils compelled to appoint a special committee to carry out the proposals of this Bill alone. The Amendment would enable power to be given to county councils to appoint a committee to carry out this work, but it would not bind them down so that the work in question would be all that the committee would be able to undertake.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02148"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> was sorry that the Government could not accept the Amendment. One of the main principles of this part of the Bill was to call attention to the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0361"/>
<col>709</col>
importance of this subject, and it was thought that to set up a statutory committee of the kind proposed dealing with this special subject was the best way to set about the matter. There was also the question of public convenience to be considered, and it was believed that if every county had a special committee dealing with the subject it would greatly facilitate the working of the Bill, while at the same time ensuring that information would be readily accessible to everybody, because there would be no confusion as to the source to which to apply for it. There was nothing in the Bill to prevent other duties being put on the committee if that were desired by any particular county council, and he hoped their Lordships would agree to the terms of the Bill, especially as this proposal was based on the recommendations of the Select Committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02149"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> desired to know if he might take the noble Earl's speech as an authoritative statement that there was nothing in the Bill to prevent other duties being placed on the committee.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02153"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> moved to omit from the First Schedule paragraph 5, which, he said, could not possibly stand in the Bill because it prohibited counsel and expert witnesses. In this particular case there could not possibly be a stronger instance of the injustice of not allowing counsel to be heard. The local authority would be the other party in the appeal. The local authorities had town clerks and expert officers who were constantly dealing with this kind of matter. The result would be that there would be on the side of the local authority an expert adviser. He had himself more than once been engaged in these cases and met men who were more than a match for any counsel. The prohibition of counsel would certainly be depriving the landowner, whose solicitor had very likely not had any experience of these cases, of having the assistance to which he was entitled. The family
<col>710</col>
solicitor could not employ another solicitor. He must either go himself or he must employ counsel, and to suggest that a local authority, who had their expert adviser in the person of their town clerk or solicitor constantly dealing with these kinds of questions, was to be allowed to have such officers appearing and that the land owner should be prohibited from having counsel was nothing short of a monstrous injustice. The provision that counsel should be allowed to appear in cases in which the Local Government Board decided was an extraordinary one. He could not imagine a greater misuse of power than that the Local Government Board, in many cases directly interested under this Bill, should be allowed to say whether a person who had a claim was to be represented by counsel. There were questions of injurious affection, questions of how much the land was to contribute, and questions of closing orders, and to say that no counsel should be allowed was, in his opinion, a great injustice and one which could not possibly be allowed to remain in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02154">With regard to expert witnesses, he would only say that equally in this case the local authority always had their expert witnesses. The town clerk and the borough surveyor were always experts. They knew all about the value of the land. The poor, unfortunate man who was having, perhaps, his six or seven acre field taken was to be at the mercy of the local authority because he was not to be allowed to have anybody come in and say what the value of his land was. He agreed that in interests of economy there should be a limit&#x2014;that was dealt with in a subsequent Amendment&#x2014;but to prohibit it altogether would again be giving to the local authority preference and privilege to which they were certainly not entitled. The earlier part of the paragraph meant nothing. To say that a man was to act on his own experience as to whether a house ought to be closed, and his own experience as to whether land was injuriously affected, was simply to say that a man was to disregard evidence that might be brought before him. He supposed they would be told that this was taken from the Small Holdings Act. If that were so, all he could say was that the experience of that Act did not encourage in them the belief that that Act ought to be perpetuated. The injustice that had been caused under that Act in cases before the Courts would not have occurred had a man been able to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0362"/>
<col>711</col>
have proper representation. But he put the matter forward net on those grounds but as a point of principle. There was nothing in the procedure of this Bill, nothing in regard to questions of improved town-planning, of pulling down houses or of taking a man's property for the purposes of erecting working-class dwellings&#x2014;there was nothing in those questions which ought to induce their Lordships to deprive a man of having proper representation. If they did not allow that right to the landowner they were conferring a great preference and privilege on the local authority such as they ought not to confer. This was a most important Amendment, and he had received representations respecting it from many parts and from representatives of many professions other than that of his own, the Bar.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02174"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill to which I now ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading has come from the House of Commons. The object of the Bill is to apply to Scotland the Act of 1800 for the
<col>714</col>
prevention of cruelty to wild animals in captivity. The important part of that Act is Section 2, which provides that any person guilty of cruelty to any wild animal in captivity or causing any unnecessary suffering to such animal is liable to a penalty not exceeding three months imprisonment or to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;5. There is reason for applying the Bill to Scotland, because at present there is no existing Act for the protection of wild animals in captivity, and there has been from time to time cases of cruelty which the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been unable to take up through the absence of any Act. Section 5 of the Act of 1800, which I wish to repeal, merely states that this Act shall not apply to Scotland, but in conversation with the Secretary for Scotland, Lord Pentland, I understand that it is probable that additional words will have to be added to make it apply to Scotland. A mere repeal would appear not to be sufficient, without further words, to make it apply. In the meantime, I would ask your Lordships to recognise the importance of applying this Act to Scotland and to give this Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

Your Lordships will have observed that no small number of Amend-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0364"/>
<col>715</col>
ments, some of them of a very drastic character, have been placed on the Paper with reference to the financial provisions of the Bill, and I think it is incumbent on the House, having regard to its own dignity and to its customary procedure, to consider what course ought to be taken with regard to these Amendments. Speaking generally of these Amendments, though not exhaustively, it may be said that several of them propose to place a further charge, in some cases of a large amount&#x2014;although that is not a strictly relevant consideration&#x2014;upon the finances of the country; and according to the custom which prevails between the two Houses we may, I think, take it as certain that any such Amendments sent down from here to another place would by the authorities there be regarded as a breach of the privileges of that House. I might further point out that a great many of these Amendments would not only constitute a breach of privilege so far as we are concerned, but they go beyond anything which could be done in another place, because, as your Lordships very well know, provisions of that kind cannot be moved in another place except by the Government of the day. Consequently, in attempting to enforce such provisions we should be going, not only outside our own usual customs, but we should be arrogating to ourselves powers not exercised by members of the House of Commons. In those circumstances we have to consider what is the best course for us to take. In his speech towards the close of the debate on the Second Reading the noble Lord, whom I do not see in his place, Lord Curzon, drew attention to the fact that a great part of my speech in moving the Second Reading was devoted to this financial question. My Lords, that was purposely done in consideration of the facts which I have just been stating to your Lordships. It seems to me to be not entirely unreasonable that the financial bearing of the Bill should be discussed in general terms at such length as your Lordships may desire. I should have been glad if the debate on the Second Reading had been protracted with the view of that general discussion; but when it comes to moving Amendments, we are, I think, as your Lordships will admit, in a somewhat different position. Personally, and speaking for myself, I have no objection to discussing once more, if it should be once more, or afresh, if it should be afresh, any financial points that may arise in connection with the particular Amendments moved by noble
<col>716</col>
Lords, but speaking not as a member of the Government but as a member of your Lordships' House I do think that it would be unfortunate if Amendments of the kind I have mentioned were sent down to another place. What I have said does not apply to all the Amendments dealing with Part I. There is, for instance, an Amendment in the name of the noble Lord opposite, Lord Langford, dealing with priority, a great part of which appears to me to be outside what I have said. That is a legitimate subject for discussion, although I think there is one subsection of his Amendment which would without doubt have the effect of increasing the charge on the Exchequer. But, speaking generally, the effect of the Amendments is as I have stated, and I have thought it right therefore to call the attention of your Lordships to the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02181"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to hear the noble Earl the Leader of the House announce that he is quite ready to discuss questions which will arise on some of the Amendments to be moved by my noble friends on this side of the House, and to which he took exception, on account of their supposed encroachment on the privilege of the House of Commons. To my mind such a discussion would be most desirable. The financial provisions of this Bill really are of vital importance, and must to some extent affect our deliberations with regard to the remaining clauses. It seems to be quite evident, for example, that some of the proposals of the Government are likely to operate most prejudicially to the progress of purchase in Ireland. But there is another aspect of the case upon which I wish to touch. A great many of these suggestions were not debated at all in the House of Commons owing to the application of the guillotine, and it seems to me, therefore, quite clear that those who have given attention to this particular aspect of the case are well within their rights when they desire to avail themselves of the wider opportunities afforded in this House in order to secure an adequate consideration of that which they desire to submit to Parliament. I may also say this, that some of the Amendments which will be proposed from this side are Amendments which have been promoted entirely with the object of making helpful suggestions to His Majesty's Government&#x2014;suggestions which, although we might not be in a position to impose them
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0365"/>
<col>717</col>
upon the Government, are yet at least entitled to the most open-minded examination at their hands. I hope, therefore, we shall debate these Amendments. Whether the noble Lords who have put them down will think it desirable to press them to a Division is another matter, but what I do respectfully ask for them is that they shall be fully and freely discussed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02182"><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member><membercontribution>: I would like to ask the noble Earl a question of which I have given him private notice, Is it the intention of His Majesty's Government to give any priority to vendors to whom the subclauses of Clause 3 apply over those dealt with by subsection (2) of the same clause, or are future vendors under subsection (3) to wait until those vendors who have pending purchase agreements are disposed of? There is some doubt among many of us who come from Ireland as to what will be the procedure under these circumstances. If future vendors are to wait there is really no use in their coming to terms with their tenants, as according to the time which will be required for the pending purchase agreements to be disposed of they may have to wait for from seven to ten years for payment. There is very little difficulty in carrying through ordinary sales, whereas in some of the pending purchases there may be a great deal of difficulty about title, possible complications, arrangements to be come to; and although the agreements have been completed with the tenants there may be a number of legal difficulties in the way of the purchase, and consequently their completion may be postponed for a number of years. Under these circumstances, I think it is rather hard on a future vendor who has voluntarily deprived himself of his estate and tries to live on the interest in lieu of rent paid by the Land Commission, if he has to wait while the pending purchases are completed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02183"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Earl the Leader of the House answers that question, I beg respectfully to say that I think he would find it easier to answer it if he would do so when the debate on Lord Langford's Amendment after Clause 3 is closed, because I think the debate on that clause will throw light on the point which my noble friend has raised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02184"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am willing to take either course, although perhaps it
<col>718</col>
would be the simplest to reply generally now to the noble Lord, and, of course, any further light which debate on the Amendment of the noble Lord opposite may throw upon it may lead to some further observations from me. What the noble Lord asks is whether future vendors who come in under Clause 3, subsection (3), can hope to have their cases dealt with at all until all pending agreements have been disposed of. As the law stands at present, it is clear that they could not; they would have to wait their turn. But the House will remember what I said at the time of the Second Reading with regard to the arrangements proposed for the Estates Commissioners. Supposing that five millions in cash and five millions only, are available, which we are bound to assume so long as stock is at its present price, one million of that cash would be required for the purpose of sales through the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners, two millions would be devoted to those who will take cash and cash only, and the remaining two millions to those who were willing to take half cash and half stock; and it was hoped that a further two millions might be dealt with for those who were prepared to take stock only. That would make nine millions; but it is hoped that the Estates Commissioners would be able to deal with advances to the amount of ten millions, and if that hope is realised that would enable somewhere about one million of these future agreements, paid in three per cent. stock or cash at the discretion of the Treasury under the subsection mentioned by the noble Lord, to be dealt with in any given year. The noble Lord, I think, somewhat overstated the time when he said that future vendors and purchasers may have to wait, even at the worst, from seven to ten years. We should hope that the pending agreements would be cleared off before that time, and in the circumstances I have named we hope it may be possible for a certain proportion of the future agreements to be dealt with almost from the first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02185"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I desire to point out that the noble Earl the Leader of the House has made about the most important announcement that has been made since this Bill has been in print. We now understand that future agreements are in some cases to receive
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0366"/>
<col>719</col>
what practically amounts to priority over agreements which have been waiting for three or four or five years. If the members of this House had been made acquainted with that arrangement or that part of the scheme before the Bill was read a second time, my noble friend Lord Dun-raven would have had much more support against the Second Reading than he got last week.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02188">[THE EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02190">1.&#x2014;(1) In the case of advances made in pursuance of future purchase agreements, three pounds ten shillings shall be substituted for three pounds five shillings as the rate of the purchase annuity under section forty-five of the Irish Land Act, 1903 (in this Act referred to as the Act of 1903).</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02193"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> moved an Amendment providing that, if the landlord and tenant so agree, these proposed alterations shall not have effect, and that "in lieu thereof the rate of interest comprised in the annuity of &#x00A3;3 5s. referred to in Section 45 of the Irish Land Act, 1903 (in this Act referred to as the Act of 1903), shall be such rate, not exceeding three per cent., as the Treasury may prescribe from time to time, and every such change in the rate of interest shall be published by the Treasury in the Dublin Gazette." He said that this Amendment was put down for consideration in another place, but owing to the use of the closure it was impossible to move it. He was glad that the Amendment which stood first on the Notice Paper in their Lordships' House should be one which did not directly interest landlords, but which did to a very large extent benefit tenants. That fact might, perhaps, tend to make those who criticised the action of their Lordships' House, and who thought that their Lord
<col>720</col>
ships were too much influenced by selfish motives, realise that in this Bill, at any rate, they were not approaching this subject in their own interests, but were trying to put the Bill into such a shape that it would be a benefit to the people of Ireland as a whole. It might be objected by the noble Earl the Leader of the House that this was one of the Amendments which dealt with the question of privilege. But he thought he had better deal with the Amendment first, and then try to argue that privilege did not enter into this case. As the Bill stood at present, the sinking fund remained the same as it had been in the past&#x2014;namely, one half per cent., while the rate of interest was to be ra<ob/>ed from two and three quarters to three per cent. The Amendment which he moved proposed for the present at any rate to retain the rate of interest as fixed in the Bill, but to vary the sinking fund and to make it less. He was told that the effect of this would be that whereas under the scheme of the Bill the total loan would be repaid in sixty-eight years, if the Amendment was adopted all they had to do was to reverse the figures and put eighty-six years instead of sixty-eight. There was no doubt that this suggestion would be extremely popular amongst tenants in Ireland. They cared extremely little whether their remote descendants seventy years hence might have to pay annuity a few years longer, but they did care very much what they had to pay at the present time, particularly when they knew that their neighbours who had purchased under the provisions of former Acts were paying at that rate. In proof of this he mentioned that in the Act of 1885 annuities were prolonged, and out of 22,247 purchasers under that Act, no fewer than 21,236 took advantage of the change which enabled them to pay a lesser annuity and extend the period. Out of 897 purchasers under the Act of 1891, no fewer than 878 took advantage of this provision. As to the question of the security of the State, he did not think that this matter of extending the repayments would be of any great importance when they remembered that at present the annuities under the Act of 1885 were extended to seventy-nine years. There was a provision in his Amendment which might make the time for the total repayments rather shorter, because if under some other Government, within the next fifty years, it might be possible to borrow money on more advantageous terms than
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0367"/>
<col>721</col>
at present, the Treasury was authorised to vary the rate of interest. The consequence would be that the sinking fund would be larger, and the total amount would be repaid in a shorter time. As to the question of privilege, he submitted that this was not a question of taxation at all. This was a loan from the State which had to be repaid. He did not propose to vary the interest except with the consent of the Treasury, and all he suggested was that instead of a fixed sinking fund it should be a variable one. Their Lordships might remember that the suggestion to change the tenants' annuity and raise it met with very much opposition in another place, and it was only carried by a majority of thirty-two. He thought that if it had been possible to discuss this matter his Amendment might perhaps have been carried in another place. If the noble Earl the Leader of the House allowed that this Amendment was not a question of privilege and if it should come back from another place objected to after consideration, he did not think this was an Amendment upon which their Lordships could insist. But it would be a great thing if it could be submitted for consideration there. If, however, the noble Earl refused to consider it, he should begin to think that the noble Earl was afraid that the Chief Secretary might again fall a victim to the blandishments of the Irish Party, and that the noble Earl was anxious to save him from that temptation.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02195"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid His Majesty's Government cannot accept the Amendment, but before I discuss it I should like to say one word in reply to the noble Lord and the noble Marquess opposite, with regard to the absence of discussion in another place on this or other Amendments. Without attempting to discuss either the merits or the demerits of the system known as the guillotine, it is undoubtedly a fact obvious to everybody who read the debates which took place on this matter in another
<col>722</col>
place that the line which was taken by the Opposition&#x2014;and it was quite within their right to take it if they pleased&#x2014;was, instead of dealing with a particular Amendment such as this, to engage on each day in a general discussion. That was the line which was taken, and the result was that in the course of nine days in Committee very few individual Amendments were dealt with. It is not for me to say whether this Amendment constitutes a breach of the privilege of the House of Commons or not. In my view it undoubtedly does, but the noble Lord does not think so, and he must take the course as regards that which he thinks best. But on the merits of the Amendment I ought to say one word. The noble Lord lightly dismissed the reversal of the figures from sixty-eight and a-half years purchase to eighty-six and a-half. I do not know what he would say if someone owed him &#x00A3;100 and only offered him 001 for his &#x00A3;100. There are thus cases when a reversal of the figures may have very serious results. At the very best, the time of purchase would be extended to seventy-six years&#x2014;that is to say, if interest were fixed at two and seven-eighths; but I am given to understand that the Treasury entirely decline to contemplate a longer period than sixty-eight and a-half years. That, as I think I said before, they consider too long, and it must be remembered that when we began first to talk about land purchase in Ireland forty-nine years was considered the reasonable and proper period. Stress has been laid on the undesirability of different tenants holding in the immediate neighbourhood at what are practically different rents from each other. I admit there is an objection to that, but it is one which may easily be overstated. In the first place, it exists to a large extent at present. There are no small number who purchased under the former Acts who are paying at a higher rate, and the same thing, of course, applies in the case of judicial rents. Under those circumstances, although we admit a certain degree of objection, we are not prepared to alter the provisions as they stand in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02196"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said that as this Amendment proposed by Lord Oranmore was not receiving much support from the leaders of the Opposition, it probably would not be carried to a Division. He ventured to think, however, that there was much to be said for it. With regard to the argument of the noble Earl the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0368"/>
<col>723</col>
Leader of the House that the Treasury altogether declined to contemplate repayment in eighty-six years, the noble Earl seemed to think that that disposed of the matter. As an old Treasury man he (Viscount Milner) fully appreciated the view of the Treasury. They naturally would prefer to be repaid in sixty-eight years rather than in eighty-six years, but he could not admit that that very natural and proper feeling on their part entirely settled the question for the Legislature. Looking at it in a common-sense way, he did not think that the extension of the period, though undoubtedly a drawback, was a drawback at all commensurate with the very great advantage which would arise from the fact that by the extension of time future purchasers would be put in exactly the same position as those who had already purchased in respect of the amount of their instalments. Personally he thought the Amendment was a very defensible one, and if it were possible to induce the other House to reconsider its decision on the subject great service would be rendered to the cause of the smooth working of land purchase in Ireland. He desired to make one other observation by way of <i>caveat</i>, and it was on the question of privilege. The noble Lord who moved this Amendment did not think the Amendment was an invasion of the privilege of the Commons, and he agreed with him. On the other hand, the noble Earl the Leader of the House said he was clearly of opinion that it was. Well, this question of privilege was one which he had done his best to study, and he was bound to say that the authorities were so extremely conflicting that it was, perhaps, rash to speak with any great definiteness on the subject. But since the subject was once more going to play an important part in the politics of this country he wished to be allowed to say at this stage that he could not admit that, where there was no question of directly increasing the charge and burden borne by the taxpayers the House of Lords was precluded from taking any action which might in some indirect way affect the Exchequer or the financial position of the country. It seemed to him that, if they were going to allow the doctrine of privilege to be pushed to this point and to admit that they had no right even in the discussion of Bills which were not Money Bills, to suggest Amendments, they would be excluding themselves from profitably discussing a vast number of measures which they had always
<col>724</col>
been in the habit of discussing. That objection might be raised on almost any important clause of a very large number of Bills&#x2014;such as had been before their Lordships' House quite recently. As an independent member of their Lordships' House he felt rather alarmed at the tone already adopted on the Government Bench on this question of privilege, and must reserve to himself the right of protesting again if it was pushed to what he believed to be an unreasonable point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02197"><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member> said that as an Irishman who desired that this Bill, if it was to become law, should pass with the greatest possible case, and that its operations should be such as would be supported by the Irish population as a whole, he did hope that His Majesty's Government would think seriously as to whether they could not do something to meet the Amendment of the noble Lord. There was no doubt that an Irish tenant if he saw a neighbour paying a different sum from himself was very apt to think there was some injustice, and if they desired peace in Ireland every effort should be made that no one man should be able to say that he was paying more than another for the same amount of land and of the same value, but that the whole nation should feel that this Act was one which was for their benefit. He also agreed with the remark made by Lord Oranmore that the average tenant would be very pleased indeed to feel that the length of tenure was to be eighty-six years rather than sixty-eight. He did not believe there was one man in Ireland who wanted it to be sixty-eight rather than eighty-six.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02198"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I have no desire to enter into a general discussion on the subject raised by the noble Viscount who spoke from the Cross Benches. I have had occasion before now to state my views on the question of privilege. It is not our business as the Government of the day to guard the privileges of the House of Commons. Those privileges are in the keeping of that Chamber, and when any measure or any Amendment reaches them from here which they consider conflicts with those privileges, it is not the Government but Mr. Speaker and the officers of the House who call attention to the fact. My only object in mentioning the matter at all was that it did not seem right that we on these Benches should, so to speak, encourage your Lordships to send down to another place Amendments which may be there regarded as breaches of privilege. Having said this
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0369"/>
<col>725</col>
once, I have no desire to even call attention on any particular Amendment as to whether it constitutes in my opinion a breach of privilege or not. Noble Lords opposite are quite as competent as I am to form their own judgment on that point, and they must deal with each in the way they think best. I merely called attention to the fact, and I am able after that, I think, to wash my hands of the whole business. I have only one more observation to make, and that is with regard to the merits of this Amendment. We are told that it is a most unfortunate thing that in any circumstances tenants should be paying different annuities or rents under the same conditions. It may be a long time to look ahead, and the tenants of the moment, as the noble Earl, Lord Meath, said, would jump at the proposition, but how about the time when one set of freeholders are paying nothing, and the others are paying this annuity during the intervening period between sixty-eight and eighty-six years? When that time comes you will have in an extremely acute form the difficulty of different tenants in the same circumstances not only paying different rents, but one set paying annuity and the others nothing at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02199"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I desire to make one observation with regard to the question of privilege which we have been discussing this afternoon. The noble Earl the Leader of the House has told us, and I think we have heard something of the same kind before, that it is not for him and his colleagues to defend the privileges of the House of Commons, that they rested entirely, I think he said, with Mr. Speaker and the officers of the House, and that if Mr. Speaker and the officers of the House decide that there has been a breach of the privilege of the House of Commons there is an end of the matter. Now, my Lords, I do not think that is exactly how things happen. What does happen, unless I am very much misinformed, is this. The Speaker advises the House that there has been a breach of the privileges of the House of Commons, and it is then a question for the House to decide whether it will insist upon its privilege or not. When that event happens the House is apt to be guided by the advice of the Government of the day, and what has happened more than once has been that the House has been advised by the colleagues of the noble Earl opposite to insist on its privilege, even when in this House noble Lords opposite
<col>726</col>
have been obliged to admit that the Amendment which had been inserted here was really one which improved the measure before the House. I do not think it is quite fair to place the whole of the responsibility upon the Speaker and officers of the House, because that responsibility to a very great extent belongs to the noble Earl opposite and to his colleagues.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02200"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> desired to say one word of a practical character, and to give a concrete case, which, he said, very often carried more weight than a theoretical one. Their Lordships would probably remember that in 1891 Mr. Balfour, who was then Chief Secretary for Ireland, introduced a Land Purchase Bill into Parliament. There were considerable alterations to be made in the Bill in their Lordships' House, and he (Lord Londonderry) was instructed that if he moved Amendments to the financial part of that Bill those Amendments would be accepted in another place. Those Amendments were inserted and were accepted in another place. Why? Because the Government of the day were anxious to have those Amendments, and they had that moral force which if exercised to-day would go a long way towards meeting these financial questions, which had to be raised in their Lordships' House for the simple reason that they had not been discussed in another place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02201"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> said the noble Earl opposite had told them that tenants might not object to paying their small annuities, but that their descendants would object. He desired to point out with regard to that, that the whole of the new proprietors were not created the same year, and those who were created under the Bill of 1903 would become by degree freeholders in the same way that the men created under the new Bill would become freeholders. Therefore there would not be that friction arising from the difference in time of repayment. The noble Earl had said that forty-nine years had previously been fixed as the time of repayment and that the Treasury did not like to extend that period, but he called the noble Earl's attention to the fact that that had been increased to seventy-nine years. In the circumstances, however, he did not intend to press his Amendment to a Division.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02203">On the Question that Clause 1 stand part of the Bill&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02204"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> moved that the clause be deleted from the Bill. He said that he would take advantage of the very courteous words of the Leader of the House who said he did not think there was any reason why they should not discuss in general terms the financial aspects of this Bill. His reasons for proposing to delete the clause was that in the 1903 Act the tenant paid an annuity of &#x00A3;3 5s. for each &#x00A3;100 advanced. Under this Bill he would have to pay &#x00A3;3 10s. per &#x00A3;100 advanced. Five shillings might sound a very small sum, but to some tenants it was a very serious question, and this alteration in the annuity was likely to obstruct land purchase in Ireland. He was not going to talk about privilege. They were getting to the real cause of this change in the annuity. They were told that the tenant and the landowner must come forward and help the Treasury, in consequence of the state of the money market, by foregoing some of the provisions of the 1903 Act, and to enable land purchase to go on in Ireland. They were asked to help the Treasury to pay the loss on flotation of loans, and in the same breath they were told, with much emphasis, that land purchase must go on in Ireland. That had been often said both in the House of Commons and in their Lordships' House. This was the policy of the present Government. He thought that they in Ireland were really as good judges of the question of land purchase going on as the Treasury, and also as Mr. Birrell, and likewise his financial advisers. He noticed that Mr. Healy, with his usual habit of going straight to the point on a matter, said that he wondered whether the same set of liars were advising Mr. Birrell as formerly did. He did not wish to say anything rude, but it struck him that when one began to talk about the Treasury in that way, one began to make a joke of a very serious character. He did not wish to make a joke, but he mentioned that that was the way it was taken up by one of the Irish members in the House of Commons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02205">They were also told that the English taxpayer had pledged his credit to finance Irish land purchase. They had heard a great deal about the English taxpayer, but the Irish taxpayer paid exactly the same taxes as the individual English taxpayer. Class for class
<col>728</col>
he was taxed exactly the same. Ireland for the purposes of taxation was not treated as a separate entity. He was very sorry not to see Lord St. Davids in his place, or he would have commended that remark to his notice. This was the first time for forty years that any Government had proposed to increase the rate of the tenant's annuity. The uniform course in each Purchase Act had been to attempt to reduce the tenant's annuity. Under the Acts of 1885, 1888, and 1891 that annuity was reduced; in the Act of 1896 it was reduced from four per cent., and the Act of 1903 restored it to three and a quarter, the lowest figure so far reached. By reduction of the annuity two good things were secured&#x2014;(1) it was made easier for landlord and tenant to come together; and (2) the security for the State was made better. In the House of Commons Mr. Redmond moved to omit this clause. That was debated up to the point when the guillotine fell. They had heard a great deal about the "will of the people." The "will of the people" was expressed by the representatives of Ireland, and in a House of 333 members the Government could only get a majority of thirty-five. He did not know whether that would influence their Lordships, but that was a fact they could not get over. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill knew as well as he did that if the tenant's annuity was increased it would increase the difficulties of carrying on land purchase; there were other provisions of the Bill that made it very difficult too. There would be the difficulty of bringing the landlord and the tenant together to make a bargain. The real truth would be that the tenant would have to pay more, and the landowner would have to ask more in order to cover this. They were not dealing with land purchase for the first time in their lives. They were well able to arrange these bargains between themselves, but then the Government stepped in and said, "The English taxpayer must not find so much money. You are to help him. But land purchase must go on."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02206">He submitted that that proviso would not help land purchase to go on. He admitted that, in the present condition of the money market, if loans were floated there would be a tremendous loss; but what they wanted in this matter was patience, and not to be hurried on and told that they must sell their land, that the tenant must pay a larger annuity, and that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0371"/>
<col>729</col>
the landlord must sell and receive half stock and half cash, or cash 'or stock whether he liked it or not. The noble Earl the Leader of the House had divided the four millions into two parts. He said that two millions was to go for cash payments, and the other two millions for stock payments and partly cash. He had pointed out that they had not got that in the Bill, but the noble Earl hoped that the Estates Commissioners would see their way to carry that out. He used the word "hoped" over and over again. Well, they all hoped for the best, and they had been hoping for the best for a very long time, but they wished that the Government would put these things in the Bill and not indulge in hopes. Then they would have something tangible to go upon. He hoped the noble Earl would take that remark in good part. He did not believe the question of privilege came in when he moved to delete this clause from the Bill. He believed they had a right to delete a clause of this kind, but not to amend it. But he was not going into that, as the question of privilege had been well discussed by those much abler than himself. The feeling in Ireland as expressed by its representatives in the House of Commons was against this clause, and the feeling of noble Lords from Ireland was also against it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02208"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said it might be thought that an increase of a quarter per cent. on a purchase annuity of a tenure only amounted to five shillings, which did not seem on the face of it to be very much; but the fact remained that if they took a quarter per cent. on the amount of money which was still to be advanced, taking the Poor Law valuation of the land yet to be sold, and multiplied that by the number of years in which that amount of money had to be repaid, it meant that the Treasury would take another &#x00A3;20,000,000 out of Ireland, if, of course, the price of the land to be sold remained the same as it was to-day.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02211"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Oh yes, it is an Amendment to leave out a clause. The effect of the Amendment would be to leave the rate of annuity at three and a-quarter instead of making it three and a-half as we propose. We assume, of course, that Clause 6, which transfers the burden from the Irish ratepayer to the Treasury, will be carried, and the effect of that would be, assuming that the loss on excess stock would amount to something like twenty-five millions, that the extra charge to the Treasury would be &#x00A3;800,000 a year; and allowing for the Development Grant would leave a charge of &#x00A3;640,000 a year. Well, the way the noble Earl puts that is that it is taking so much Irish money. Considering what the Exchequer is advancing, I confess that seems to me hardly a fair way to put it, and I am afraid, therefore, that there is no chance of our being able to accept the noble Earl's Amendment. Of course, we should have preferred, had it been financially possible, to leave the rate at three and a-quarter, but it is not financially possible, and therefore we cannot undertake it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02212"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said that the noble Earl seemed to take a very pessimistic view of the future. He admitted it would be very difficult, no matter what financial provision they made, to carry on land purchase in Ireland except at very great loss, but he did not think that that enormous loss would continue for ever. If it did the prospect was indeed very black. He trusted that things would be a little better than they were to-day, considering the present price of Consols. He would not press his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02219">(3) For the purpose of carrying into effect future purchase agreements advances may, if the Treasury think fit so to direct, be made by means of the issue of an amount of guaranteed three per cent. stock equal in nominal amount to the sum to be advanced and carrying dividends as from the date of the advance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02220">(4) Stock issued in pursuance of this section as the equivalent of an advance shall, as between the vendor and the purchaser, be accepted by the vendor as the equivalent of the corresponding amount of purchase money, and a vendor, although he is not an absolute owner, may agree to advances being made by stock under this section for the purpose of carrying out any pending purchase agreements, and any person having power to sell under the Land Purchase Acts, although he is not an absolute holder, may enter into any future purchase agreement, notwithstanding that the purchase money may be payable in stock in pursuance of this section instead of in cash.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02221"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> moved to amend the provision in the clause which provided that advances might be made by the issue of such an amount of guaranteed two and three-quarters per cent. stock as at the market price was equivalent to the sum to be advanced, if that price was not below &#x00A3;92 for stock of nominal value of &#x00A3;100, or, if the stock was below that price, by the issue of such an amount as would be equivalent to the sum to be advanced if the stock were at that price. He proposed to substitute the figure "&#x00A3;88" for "&#x00A3;92." He said that this was one of the most important clauses in the Bill, which affected not only the agreements already arrived at between the landowner and the tenant and which were in course of completion, but also future purchase agreements. This clause practically meant the repeal of Section 27 of the Land Act of 1903. Under that Act all vendors were to receive the purchase money for their estates in cash, and were able to make their bargains with their tenants on a cash basis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02222">He would pass to the effect of the figure &#x00A3;92. In respect to purchase agreements, Clause 3, subsection (2), of the
<col>732</col>
Bill purported to give an option to a vendor to receive his purchase money in two and three-quarters per cent. stock, but if he did not like to exercise his option he was to be compelled to take, instead of every &#x00A3;100 cash, an amount of stock as would be equivalent in value to &#x00A3;100, if the market value of the stock was not below &#x00A3;92; but if the market price was below &#x00A3;92 the vendor, notwithstanding this, must accept stock as if it was at ninety-two, although, in fact, it might be only at eighty-five. The price of guaranteed two and three-quarters per cent. stock was eighty-five and a fraction to-day. Through the kindness of the Irish Office he had a table which showed the different prices that a vendor would lose on every &#x00A3;100 of purchase money. Supposing the price was eighty-four, he would lose 8&#x00B7;7; if it was eighty-five, he would lose 7&#x00B7;6, and so on. That omitted the cost of brokerage. But though the vendor lost if the stock was under ninety-two, he did not get the benefit if it was over that price. If His Majesty's Government put the figure at eighty-eight, the position would be a great deal better with regard to this issue of stock. The Chief Secretary, speaking generally with regard to this Bill on the third day of the Committee stage, said&#x2014;
<quote>"But you cannot ask us to throw all considerations of pounds shillings and pence to the winds. You cannot ask us to repeat in the future the mistakes that have been made in the past. We are quite prepared when the time comes to consider any rational proposal that may be made on this subject, and not in any heated or angry spirit but with a desire to carry out this great system of land purchase in the best possible way."</quote>
The right hon. gentleman might not have been speaking on this particular thing, but presumably those words showed the feeling in his mind, at any rate, with regard to the vendors, and he (Lord Mayo) did not see anything to contradict in that. He did not wish to treat this matter in any spirit of contradiction, but they would undoubtedly suffer very much from this fixed figure of &#x00A3;92. He warned noble Lords from Ireland that behind all this was compulsion, and they must bear in mind when the suggestions were put forward in a very nice manner by the Chief Secretary, and no doubt by the Government, that behind all and overshadowing all existed compulsion.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02224"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> asked the noble Earl the Leader of the House to tell them definitely in the course of his reply why this figure of ninety-two had been fixed upon and put into the Bill. He knew the reason given in the Runciman Report, which was that evidence was placed before them to the effect that landlords would be likely to hold stock at ninety-two because it gave them three per cent. They had been cudgelling their minds a great deal to know who it was who knew so little of Ireland as to give such evidence. Every one in Ireland knew, and it was stated to the Dudley Commission, that trustees' securities invested at their prices at the time the evidence was given yielded &#x00A3;3 11s and even &#x00A3;3 12s. per cent. When everybody in Ireland knew that, how could anybody think that landlords were likely to willingly accept a three per cent. investment when under a tustees' investment, the strictest investment they could go in for, they could get from &#x00A3;3 11s. to &#x00A3;3 12s. He hoped they would have some justification from the Government of the figure ninety-two when the noble Earl replied.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02225"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: As your Lordships all know, this provision is inserted in the Bill in respect of the block which has taken place, and its object is to hold out an inducement to vendors to take either stock or part cash and part stock in consideration of receiving a priority before the Estates Commissioners.

If any man thinks he cannot afford to hold a three per cent. investment, well, he must wait until he is entitled to be paid in cash.</membercontribution></p>

I cannot pretend to know from my own knowledge how far the noble Earl who has just sat down is right, and whether it is the case that even where it is a question of taking half cash and half stock, nobody in Ireland could be found to hold on to a three per cent. investment. I think the noble Earl took a somewhat liberal view of what could be obtained in
<col>734</col>
large amounts by trustees; it is important, I think, to bear that in mind, because I have no doubt we could all mention particular cases where three and a half per cent. can be obtained. But when you come to very large sums which might be desired to be invested at a given time, I think the noble Earl was a little sanguine in the idea that it would be possible to obtain &#x00A3;3 11s. for the whole of the money. The figure 92 was undoubtedly fixed as representing a three per cent. investment, and supposing it to be realised, taking the stock at 86&#x2014;which is about the figure one might venture to take it at&#x2014;a vendor would stand, supposing he were to realise at once, a loss of &#x00A3;6 10s. That is to say, he would receive &#x00A3;108 14s. of this stock, which would be worth in the market about &#x00A3;93 10s. That is how it works out. If the noble Earl's Amendment were taken, supposing land stock to be sold at 86, the vendor would merely stand to lose just under &#x00A3;2; on the other hand, the Treasury in that case would have to stand a loss on excess stock to the amount of &#x00A3;12 10s. Again we should have been glad if it had been possible to lower the figure, but in the circumstances, and being more sanguine than noble Lords opposite that a fair number of people will be prepared to come forward and in consideration of this acceleration to accept certainly part in stock, and some we trust all in stock, we are not able to alter the figure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02238"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member> said he wanted to put this from the tenants' point of view. They had fifty millions worth of land which they had hoped would have been sold. Many of the tenants were paying from three-and-a-half to four per cent, while waiting. Only on the previous night a noble Lord had told him that he had been kept waiting four years for his purchase money. His tenants had therefore been paying a larger annuity than they would have done if they had been vested&#x2014;namely, three-and-a-quarter per cent, in their own holdings. This was not only a landlords' but a tenants' relief Bill. Noble Lords were not there only representing themselves, but a great body of men who had signed agreements under the Act of 1903, and whom they were bound to consider as far as they could. He was much taken with the answer which the noble Earl had given to Lord Castletown, but it appeared to him that matters were not as clear as they should be with regard to those who entered into agreements in 1903. The pending agreements had been increasing enormously up to the 15th of September. The clause that the noble Earl, Lord Mayo, had dealt with just now gave no idea&#x2014;and there was no instruction anywhere in the Bill&#x2014;as to how this money was to be dealt with. In dealing with the payments to the three respective parties under this Bill they wanted to deal with them in priority, and, he hoped, with, patience and without compulsion. He
<col>736</col>
believed the Government were going to give them five millions in cash. Out of that they would take one million for future sales in congested districts. There would, therefore, be only four millions a year in cash towards clearing off the fifty millions. But they were told that in every year there would be an additional eight millions paid off. What did that mean? That out of those eight millions, four millions would have to be accepted by vendors in stock whether they liked it or not. It did not bear that construction. It would be given, and they would have to accept. If they did not like it, others could be brought in. Under subsections (1) and (2) of his Amendment he proposed to have a register of priority. Having read to the Committee subsections (3) and (4) of his proposed new clause the noble Lord said unless they had priority with regard to land purchase in Ireland, he thought there might be injustice. He was sure the Government only wanted justice, but it was absolutely necessary to have the rule of priority in these matters with regard to the payments which the Government were about to sanction. Subsection (5) of the Amendment was very important. He tried as well as he could by that section to keep everything in its proper place, to see that there was no injustice and to give priority to those who came first. As to subsection (6), they were bound to have a fair and impartial rule for dealing with these cases. This was a Government measure, and they asked the Government to meet them in this case and allow them to amend the Bill so that they would not have to wait for their payments. Subsection (8) of his proposed new clause was entirely a tenants' clause. He had read to their Lordships the whole of the Amendment and he would point out what appeared to them the necessity for having stock registers. The object of the registers was to prevent the later class of cases being given priority. There appeared to be a very great danger that those who signed agreements in 1903 and who wanted cash were likely to be swept out of sight by men coming in and taking stock. He hoped the Government would look into the danger of the stock being allowed to swamp those who wanted cash payments, and the danger of the cash payments being indefinitely postponed, not only to the disadvantage and the detriment of the landowner but to the injustice of the tenants.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02240"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the Amendment which the noble Lord had placed on the Paper dealt with an extremely intricate and technical matter, and he proposed to say a few words in explanation. There was a good deal in the noble Lord's Amendment which he thought might with advantage be accepted by the Government; on the other hand there was a great deal in it which if accepted would throw the whole work of the Estates Commissioners office out of gear. At present a general register was kept in the Estates Commissioners office in which all applications and deposits of agreements were entered in the order of presentation. They were dealt with, so far as he knew, in that order unless there were very special reasons given for dealing with the estate out of its order of priority. With this Bill, if it passed into law, an entirely new state of things would come into existence. Instead of having to deal with one class of estates the purchase money of which was to be paid in cash, they would have to deal with three classes&#x2014;one, the purchase money of which must be paid in cash; the second, in which the price must be paid in cash and stock, according to the option of the vendor; the third being purchases in which payment would be in stock alone. The ordinary procedure would be to enter upon a register which now existed all applications to sell whether coming under the Act or not, and then to create three subsidiary registers under that general register&#x2014;namely, a register for all payments in cash, a register of payments partly in cash and partly in stock, and a register, in which the payments were to be made in stock. Those several registers would be compiled from the general register, and the compilations would be in the order
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0376"/>
<col>739</col>
of priority. For instance, a person who claimed to be paid in cash would have his name entered in the cash register. Then would come a vendor who desired to be paid in cash and stock. His name would be entered in the cash and stock register, and vendors desirous of being paid in stock alone would be entered in the stock register. All those applications would naturally have priority in the order in which they were entered in their particular registers. For instance, a person entered in the cash register would have his case dealt with in the order of his priority in that register. In like manner a person in the cash and stock register would have his case dealt with in the order of priority of entry in the part-cash-part-stock register. No disadvantage would accrue to any one from this registration in separate registers because his case would be dealt with in its own priority, and he would get his payment out of a separate allotment of money.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02241">He thought the noble Lord's object could be secured if their Lordships accepted subsections (1) and (2) of his proposed new clause, and then for subsection (3) accepted a provision running thus&#x2014; "Every proposed sale shall be entered in the general register in the order of time at which the agreements were lodged or at which the request under Section 6 of the Act was deposited; or the particulars and documents required under Section 7 were supplied." Subsidiary to such general register there should be three registers, provided for by a subsection which should run, "There shall be three supplementary registers according as the vendor desires payment to be made to him in cash or part in cash and part in stock or wholly in stock." The entries of estates in each such subsidiary register should be made according to their priority as indicated above, but thereafter priority of treatment should be that of the supplemental register in which the estate appears. Then subsection (4) should read something like this: "In the case of estates entered in each supplemental register the priority should be as follows:" incorporating paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>) of subsection (3) of the noble Lord's proposed new clause, which he thought had introduced an excellent improvement on the existing practice. The noble Lord said that payment should be given not only in the order of time of entry, but that it should also be determined by the date on which the duties imposed by the law on vendors were
<col>740</col>
discharged. Not only should the Estates Commissioners have regard to the time the papers were deposited, but also to the time when all the legal formalities had been concluded. It often happened that a vendor deposited his papers, say on the first of January, and then did not trouble himself any further for some time. Perhaps his solicitor was careless and allowed several months or perhaps a year to elapse, and no action was taken. On the other hand, the vendor who deposited his papers, say, on the first of February, and took care that his solicitor did his work, might have, all the duties imposed by the law concluded in six months time and then ask to have his case passed through. It would be a monstrous hardship that the latter vendor should be kept waiting for his money because the other vendor was negligent. If they did not place a premium upon the speedy and accurate discharge of duties in the matter they would have a block, and the result would be complaints against the Estates Commissioners Office. Fresh demands might probably be made for additional establishment charges, whereas, the real cause of the delays lay in the carelessness of the applicants themselves. Therefore he thought that the noble Lord had made a most valuable suggestion, and one that should be adopted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02242">With regard to subsection (6) of the Amendment he suggested that it should read, "At the beginning of every financial year the Treasury shall inform the Land Commission of the amount of cash intended to be provided during that year, and shall apportion that amount between advances to be made entirely in cash and advances to be made partly in cash and advances to be made on account of the Congested Districts Board." That procedure would, if adopted, introduce a simple organisation in the, Estates Commissioners Office, and no vendor would be treated out of his proper order, and the order in which he would be treated would largely depend upon his own punctuality in discharging obligations which the law imposed upon him. The noble Lord in subsection (7) of his Amendment provided that if at some time after the procedure had advanced a vendor became dissatisfied with what had been done, he might if he so desired have his estate taken out of the subsidiary register and restored to the general register. If that were allowed, great confusion would result, for the general
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0377"/>
<col>741</col>
register would, as an indication of priority, have been superseded by the subsidiary registers; and steps might have been taken accordingly which could not be recalled. The proposal in subsection (8) of the Amendment was also impracticable. What it meant was that a vendor should make his application to be paid partly in stock and partly in cash, and when the proceedings in his case had gone sufficiently far to enable the Judicial Commissioner to proceed to a distribution, he should get by way of advance the stock which was due to him while the cash would remain unpaid perhaps from three to five years until the Treasury were in funds, he in the meantime receiving three and three-quarter per cent. interest on it instead of the three and a-half per cent. which the law allowed. On the other hand the tenant would no doubt have his annuity reduced to three and a-quarter, but he would be kept out of his vesting order and the time for the commencement of his annuity. So far from being in the interests of the Irish tenants he thought this proposal would more be in the interests of the Irish landlords who having got their stock, might dispose of it and invest the proceeds at say four per cent., and at the same time get three and a-quarter per cent. interest on the remainder. He hoped the noble Lord would not press this part of his Amendment, but if he did press it, he for one, while he greatly approved of a considerable portion of his Amendment, would be compelled to oppose him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02243"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord who introduced this Amendment dealt with this exceedingly complicated matter, if he will allow me to say so, in a very clear and distinct way. The noble Lord behind me, Lord MacDonnell, as is his invariable custom, also dealt with the matter in a most lucid manner; but at the same time I think he would have assisted the deliberations of your Lordships' House as a whole if he had placed on paper his suggestions on the manner in which he thought the noble Lord's Amendment might be improved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02244"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: I intended to say that if permission were given to me I would bring up a clause on Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02245"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It undoubtedly
<col>742</col>
does make discussion of the matter more difficult when we have not before us, in settled terms, the very important modifications which Lord MacDonnell proposes to make in the Amendment. As a matter of fact, the noble Lord behind me proposes to alter the Amendment in some most important particulars. What Lord Langford proposes to do is to revert to the practice which obtained in the time of the late Government, when all applications were entered and proposed to be dealt with in the order in which the applications were made. Under the regulations which were issued in July, 1905, in the time of the Viceroyalty of Lord Dudley, vendors of land were not to be placed at a disadvantage as compared with vendors under previous Acts. The noble Lord proposes to have three registers, one dealing with direct sales, the other dealing with those under paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (3), and the other with the sales of the Land Commission under paragraph (<i>c</i>), and he proposes, I understand, that all those shall be dealt with in the order of simple priority, without any reference to the one or the other. In the first place, the noble Lord proposes that the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board should have no power of dealing separately, and even <i>pari passu</i>, with their own transactions in priority to the direct agreements. The position of the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board, if the noble Lord's Amendment were carried, would be one of real inconvenience, and I do not think that it is difficult to show that their position does differ from that of ordinary direct transactions between landlord and tenant. They buy an estate for the purpose of improving it. They redistribute some of the holdings and they create new holdings, and surely it is of real importance that they should be able to get to work at this particular business as soon as possible, and not have an estate lying on their hands&#x2014;as might be the case under the Amendment of the noble Lord&#x2014;for five years or even more. If advances had to be made in all cases of direct sales which had priority in time over some transactions with which the Estates Commissioners were concerned, that, of course, would be the case. There is a block as we all know of fifty millions in this matter of the direct sales, and the delay caused to the transactions of the Estates Commissioners would be very great indeed.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0378"/>
<col>743</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02246"><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: But the fifty millions have nothing to do with the sales of the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners. These are direct sales between landlord and tenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02247"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes; but I understand the noble Lord desires that all those direct sales which may have priority of time over sales of the Estates Commissioners should be dealt with before they can deal with those referred to in subsection (4). That subsection says&#x2014;
<quote>"The Estates Commissioners shall sanction and make advances in the order of priority in which the estates appear on the general register, unless the Judicial Commissioner, for good and sufficient grounds, shall direct that any particular estate shall not be taken in the priority appearing on the register."</quote>
I think if the noble Lord examines those words he will see that in their literal meaning they would mean a complete stoppage of the work of the Estates Commissioners. Supposing an application had been lodged and had to be postponed for some purpose, some difficulty of title, some question of turf or some matter of the kind. As the words stand, it would literally mean that all subsequent agreements would have to be hung up until this one was dealt with, even though there might be some hitch which would force it to stand over for some months or even longer. Then there is strong objection to subsection (4) of the Amendment. The noble Lord proposes that the Judicial Commissioner shall direct that any particular estate shall be taken out of its turn. Under the Act of 1903 all the administrative duties of the Land Commissioners under that Act have to be performed by the Estates Commissioners. The Judicial Commissioner has been sedulously kept clear of everything of that kind, and therefore his judicial position, the value of which I know is fully admitted by noble Lords opposite, has been maintained, but if you drag him into questions of priority and administration of this kind we fear you may seriously compromise his position in that respect. When we come to subsections (5), (6), and (7) I think your Lordships will see that their effect is altogether to do away with the provisions which we propose with regard to the issue of stock. The noble Lord stated that there was a real danger that those who desired to be paid in cash
<col>744</col>
would be crowded out&#x2014;"flooded out" I think was his expression, by the rush of those anxious to take stock. On the Last Amendment we were told that nobody was going to take stock, and I hope we may hear what the settled opinion of noble Lords opposite is. We hope and believe that there will be a settled demand in the different classes, the half and half class, and the whole stock class. Certainly we do not share the fears of noble Lords that so many applications will come forward to be paid in stock that it will be found impossible to deal with the cases of those who desire to be paid in cash. The effect of this subsection is that it would take away any advantage which might be assumed to accrue to the vendor who is willing to take part or the whole in stock. He gains nothing. He apparently comes up exactly at the same time at which he would have come up if he was to be paid in cash, and that being so, it would be useless, I think, to continue the provision for paying anybody in stock under the Act. We all admit that from the financial point of view, although he gains in time, the man who takes in stock has to lose something. If he is not to gain in time, he will have to be paid in cash, and we shall have to go on with the melancholy process of paying five millions a year in cash, and not issuing any stock at all. I think that on reconsideration, and after looking again at subsection (5), the noble Lord will see that the man who comes forward for stock has no advantage whatever over the man who we may describe as the cash man pure and simple. In fact, I am not sure that under subsection (6) of the Amendment he would not be under a disadvantage, because as long as there are any vendors unsatisfied they are to be paid in cash, but the unhappy man who wants stock is not to be dealt with, and he would be in a worse position than if he had stood out for cash instead of stock. Lord MacDonnell dealt with the complicated questions raised in subsection (8) of the noble Lord's Amendment. Subsection (8) contemplates a payment at two different times. That is to say, the stock portion of the payment is to be paid at once, and the cash portion is to be paid at some future time, possibly a number of years later. We have never contemplated that. We have always contemplated that the two payments would be made at the same time and the whole transaction closed, and the man who takes
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0379"/>
<col>745</col>
half stock would get his transaction finished a little earlier than if he had stood out for cash.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02248"><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: If he took stock, he would be paid off in cash at the same time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02249"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Oh yes, the transaction is to be a single one. He receives both at the same moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02250"><member>LORD LANGFORD</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl said something about the delay in stock and then he rather dropped his voice. He said the cash payment would not be delayed, and we are very glad to hear that on this side of the House. But I did not hear what he said about stock payments being delayed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02251"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: All I said was that he would be the gainer; he would be paid rather sooner; he would be paid with less delay than if he had stood out for cash and for cash only. Perhaps I may assume that these transactions in two stages which the noble Lord proposes in subsection (8) will not be pressed by him. Lord MacDonnell pointed out very truly&#x2014;and I could give some figures on the subject if the Committee desired&#x2014;that by such a plan it would be quite possible and conceivable that a landlord might receive during this interval considerably more than he had been receiving from the tenants in the form of rent. I will not trouble the Committee with the figures unless they are desired. Lord MacDonnell said he would bring the matter up again on Report, and I should not like to give a definite opinion upon it before I have seen it in print. It was not our suggestion to include this in the Bill at all, for the simple reason that similar provisions had been placed in the form of regulations, and our intention was to issue them in the form of regulations, which no doubt could be placed at the disposal of Parliament before any long time has elapsed. Noble Lords will remember that the regulations which were issued in February, 1906, just after we came into office contained this provision with regard to priority, "The Estates Commissioners shall so regulate their business for advances in respect to holdings that holdings proposed to be sold under Sections 1 to 5 of the Act shall be as far as possible
<col>746</col>
in the priority in which the agreements were deposited in the office and the other duties imposed on vendors and tenant purchasers by law have been discharged." Those, I think, are practically the same words as the noble Lord has got in his Amendment. Under Heading B. there was established the order of priority, giving power to the Estates Commissioners to accelerate the advance of purchase money. We know the history of those regulations, and it has been our intention&#x2014;to which we should be disposed to adhere unless there is some strong reason shown to the contrary&#x2014;to proceed again by regulation in this case, instead of placing the provisions in the Bill. There would, I think, be greater convenience in proceeding by regulations in a case of this kind than by absolutely stereotyping the sums&#x2014;no, not the sums, I suppose Lord MacDonnell does not propose to mention any sum of money?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02252"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: No, I propose to leave that to the Treasury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02253"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, because, of course, it would be clearly impossible for the Treasury to be bound by an Act of Parliament to make an issue of cash in a particular year. But, as I say, subject to anything that may be said in the course of the debate we propose to issue these in the form of regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02254"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said this question had attracted a great deal of attention, and it was of very high importance. He did not for a moment suggest that the Government were not anxious to arrive at a perfectly fair solution of the matter, but it was obvious that this question of preserving a fair statement of priorities was one of high importance, not only as a, matter of sentiment but as a matter of substance. There was a belief that in some way or other priority had not worked out in such a way as to give those who had applied first their payments reasonably early, and that many people had had to give way to those who came in much later, particularly if those who came in later had purchased through the Congested Districts Board or the Estates Commissioners. His noble friend Lord Langford had done a valuable service to the cause of land purchase administration in Ireland in raising this discussion. Whether every syllable or subsection in this Amendment
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0380"/>
<col>747</col>
was the most proper way of meeting the difficulty might be another question. He would like before saying that it could all be accepted to read side by side with it the clauses suggested by Lord MacDonnell, who obviously spoke with knowledge, and also to be able to collate with it what the noble Earl had just said. Then it might be that when they came to report they would be in a condition to arrive at a section which would be reasonable, free from objection, and workable. When the late Government were in office, and Mr. Walter Long was in Ireland, during the Viceroyalty of Lord Dudley, there were regulations made. Some of them might be in operation still, and some had been replaced by others. But the noble Earl said he was not sure that this question could not be worked better by regulations than by the hard words of a Statute. There was something in that argument, if they knew what the regulations were to be and how and to what extent they were to be applied. He always felt the force of an argument that there was reason to leave some room for elasticity and to make necessary changes in administering large codes. He would not go into the details of the Amendment. The question bristled with complications and technicalities. There were three or four sets of owners, all with claims, and the thing was to adjust those claims in such a way that they would harmonise in administration with each other, recognising each claim put forward, and not allowing the first and earlier claims, which might be strong and urgent and unanswerable, to be postponed without very clear reason. A case had been established for providing a solution which would satisfy or seek to satisfy the heart-burning that existed on this question, and they should try to do something which would be regarded as a fair and reasonable effort to settle this question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02255"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said their Lordships would be all agreed by this time that it was not possible to arrive at any final decision on the very important points under discussion until they had had the benefit of seeing Lord MacDonnell's Amendment. But there was one point which he would like to ask the noble Earl, because it appeared to him likely that the difficulty which he felt himself might be felt; by other noble Lords who were trying to understand the position in this somewhat complicated matter. It was
<col>748</col>
with the view of eliciting information which might assist them in future debates that he asked this question. If he had misapprehended the noble Earl he hoped he would forgive him. He understood the noble Earl on the Second Reading and again this evening to say that it was the intention of the Government as far as possible to distribute five millions every year, and of this amount one million was to be available for sales to the Estates Commissioners and the remaining four millions were to be divided equally between those who insisted on having all their payment in cash and those who were willing to take half cash and half stock. It seemed a reasonable distribution, and he thought they must agree with the noble Earl that unless there were some arrangement of this kind the scheme would fail altogether. But was it intended that this distribution of the available funds should be laid down in any sort of definite and binding manner, or was it to rest absolutely with the Government of the day to vary it as much as they pleased? The noble Earl said that the intention of the Government was to make the distribution he had referred to, and no doubt when he said that on behalf of the present Government they could rely upon it that that was the course which they now meant to pursue. But for how long? Was this a matter which it was intended to leave entirely to the discretion of the Government of the day? Was it the wish of their Lordships that it should be so left? The noble Earl had pointed out that this question of priority in the past had been left to be decided by regulations. That, no doubt, was a most convenient method, but he pointed out that far more important issues were now going to depend upon the question of priority than had depended upon such regulations in the past. He thought it was fair that there should be a reasonable division of the available cash between those who wanted all in cash and those who were prepared to take part in stock. But, supposing, unfortunately, the stock was to have a very considerable fall. The effect of that undoubtedly would be that there would be less disposition to take stock. It seemed to him that in that case there would be a temptation to the Government of the day to put the screw on people to accept stock, in spite of the fall, by assigning a smaller, possibly a much smaller, proportion of the available money to those who still
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0381"/>
<col>749</col>
desired to be paid entirely in cash. Would that be entirely a fair thing to do? Was it a thing which they ought to leave entirely to the discretion of the Executive of the day? He did not pretend to decide the question, but it was a matter of greater importance than had been decided by the regulations in the past. He would like, therefore, to receive from the noble Earl some further information on this point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02256"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I will endeavour to answer the question which the noble Viscount has clearly set before us. I confess it does seem to me to be exceedingly difficult to put down in black and white exactly what the Estates Commissioners are to do in respect to the sums of money at their disposal. I fear that would be an impossible thing to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02257"><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand that. It was a question of proportion that I was asking the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02258"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: On the question of proportion, you can hardly venture to bind yourselves until you know what is going to happen. For instance, we have heard the most deplorable foreboding from some noble Lords that nobody will take half stock and half cash. If they contend that so much cash ought to be available in a given year, I suppose for solely cash payments, it seems very difficult to ear-mark a particular sum for a particular purpose. I do not think the possibility suggested by the noble Viscount is a likely one because, after all, everybody's object must be to accelerate these transactions as far as possible, and there is no means of forcing everybody to take half stock and half cash because at the back of everything remains the fact that if a man asks for cash at a given moment he is entitled to have it; and, therefore, there must always be people on the list who are entitled to be paid in cash. To say that no payments shall be made except half in cash and half in stock would be a compulsion upon vendors to take stock, and it does not seem to me possible to do that under the Act as it stands. I will consider that point, and will further consider the point as to how far it is possible, or how soon it would be possible, to place the regulations before your Lordships. We will not lose sight of the point mentioned by the noble Viscount, though I am not very confident it would be possible to find any form

What he and his noble friends were asking for was a register, and not regulations which might be varied by any Government which happened to be in power. If the matter was to come up on Report, of course that was another question altogether; but they rather took exception to regulations dealing with an entirely new state of affairs under this Bill.</p>

It is undoubtedly the case that there has been a great deal of uneasiness in regard to this question of priority. I do not say whether suspicions were well or ill-founded, but there was a suspicion that priority was not always observed exactly as it might have been. I have no doubt that in many cases there was a quite sufficient explanation of the reason for which an estate was taken out of its turn, but what my noble friend desires in future is that the matter should be put upon a perfectly clear and intelligible basis. The intricacy of the problem has been a little increased by the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, who made what seemed to be a very instructive contribution to the debate, but one which we can scarcely appreciate until we have had an opportunity of considering his words. I hope we shall have an opportunity of considering not only the scheme of my noble friend behind me, and also the scheme of the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, but that we shall also be furnished with a distinct statement as to the manner in which the Government desire to deal with this question, because as to that there is apparently much uncertainty.</membercontribution></p>

Where a vendor, under either pending or future purchase agreements, receives payment in stock instead of in cash, all charges, duties, incumbrances, and redemption prices of quitrents, tithe rentcharge or other superior interests payable out of the purchase money to the Crown, the Land Commission, the Commissioners of Public Works, or any public department, shall be received and paid in stock upon the like terms as payment in stock was received by the vendor, and it shall be lawful for the Land Judge, and the Judges of the Chancery Division, and for any trustees, in respect of any sums payable out of the purchase money into court or to such trustees, to accept payment in stock on the like terms as payment was received by the vendor."</quote>
The noble Earl said that this clause raised a very important point. Its object was to enable the vendor who accepted stock to redeem his superior interests in stock. Their Lordships were probably aware that in the case of almost every estate in Ireland&#x2014;he knew of none in
<col>752</col>
which it was not the case&#x2014;the owner was able to sell under the Purchase Acts subject to superior interests, and he fancied estates were held in Ireland subject to superior interests to a very much greater extent than they were so held in England, Scotland and Wales. The superior interests, roughly, corresponded to what were known in London as ground rents, although of course in Ireland these superior interests were found in agricultural property, and not merely in town property. These superior interests existed to a very large extent indeed. He had made some inquiries from one or two friends who were large land agents, and he was told it was by no means out of the common to find estates where the payment of superior interests exceeded as much as 25 per cent. of the rents which were collected. That was absolutely ignoring any mortgages and absolutely ignoring any family charges. They desired that when a vendor accepted stock he should have the power of redeeming these superior interests, all of which, of course, had to be redeemed when a sale took place, in stock at the price at which he received it. There was a direct precedent in the Purchase Acts themselves for such a provision as he asked their Lordships to insert. Section 17 of the Act of 1891 said that&#x2014;
<quote>"In the course of any sale proceedings, if it shall appear to the Land Commission that any tithe rent charge or head rent payable to them is redeemable out of the purchase money, and may be redeemed without injury to, and without waiting to ascertain the priority of any other charge, the Land Commission may, on the application of the landlord, order the redemption of the said tithe rent charge or head rent, by transferring to the Land Commission on account of the Irish Church Temporalities Fund, guaranteed Land Stock to the nominal amount payable in respect of such redemption."</quote>
That was a redemption in stock. In that case the redemption in stock was made at the price at which the vendor received the stock, and he was asking their Lordships' to follow that precedent absolutely. Section 15 of the same Act bore on the second part of his Amendment. It allowed trustees to accept this stock in satisfaction of their claims. Their Lordships would not forget the position. Vendors were to be offered by the Government stock at 92, no matter what its value was below 92. Was it unfair to say that the Government should take stock back at the same price in redemption of claims against them.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0383"/>
<col>753</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02266">There was one other point he would like to urge upon their Lordships. It referred only to future bargains, but it was a very important one when viewed in this light. Landlords making bargains hitherto had known, of course, that it was necessary for them to redeem their superior interests, and they had been able to calculate exactly how much purchase money they were going to get as the result of sale, because they knew they were going to get cash. They were therefore able to calculate exactly how much they would be able to spend in redeeming through superior interests, because everybody knew the prices at which superior interests under the Act of 1903 had to be redeemed; therefore, they knew how much would remain for them for subsequent investment after the sale. Now in future that certainty would very largely disappear, because a landlord would not know for certain&#x2014;could not possibly guess, in fact&#x2014;at what price the stock he was going to receive 6 or 7 years hence would stand. Therefore, if this Amendment were not adopted it would be quite impossible for him to calculate how much stock it would be necessary for him to realise in cash in order to redeem his superior interests if he had to redeem them in cash, and consequently he would be in absolute ignorance as to what would remain to him after he had redeemed those superior interests. The effect was bound to be that every landlord would be tempted to ask for a slightly higher price as an insurance against the stock being lower in price when he looked forward to getting his money five or six years hence, and the effect of forcing the landlord to make that insurance, and to ask a slightly higher price was bound to check land purchase. That, he thought, was not the desire of anybody who was interested in this Bill. He trusted, therefore, that their Lordships would accept this Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02268"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> desired to say a few words in support of his noble friend's proposed new clause, and to point out a matter that had not yet been considered. It was obviously desirable if this block was to be relieved that a great many vendors must take stock. According to the present Stock Exchange figures the stock was at eighty-five and a fraction, and it was to be given to them at the nominal value of ninety-two. The vendor lost something between six and a-half and seven per cent. on that transaction, assuming that he could turn his stock into cash to-morrow. Now in Ireland, on the whole, landlords' interests were encumbered up to about half their value, and under the provisions of these Acts the landlord could not touch one penny of his purchase money, or anything that represented the purchase money, until all the encumbrances were discharged. The result of that would be that before any estate could be wound up the vendor would be forced to put upon the market half the purchase price. In other words, assuming that they gave &#x00A3;2,000,000 a year, which the landlord took in stock, the result was that them must be &#x00A3;1,000,000 in that year put upon the market if the estate was to be wound up. That was a forced glut, and would invariably run down the price of the stock far below eighty-five, so that he would lose in fact a great deal more than six per cent. upon his purchase money. That had always appeared to him to be a reason why, if it were at all possible, the vendors should not be asked to take the entire purchase money in stock, but so much of it in cash as would enable them to deal satisfactorily with most of their encumbrances. He feared very much that unless such relief were given as was indicated in the Amendment of his noble friend, unless the vendors were enabled to pay some of the money in stock instead of in cash&#x2014;and there did not seem much unfairness in paying people back in their own coin, even though they were the State&#x2014;it would inflict a grievous loss upon those who had made contracts with their tenants.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02271"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Because it would increase the public charge. The fact, of course, is that quit rents and other charges of the kind where they are payable to the Crown are to be liquidated by stock at a discount. Now, my Lords, the noble Earl dwelt upon Section 17 of the Act of 1891, but his proposition goes considerably further than that provision. Under Section 17 of that Act it will be found that only tithe rent charges and perpetuity rents belonging to the Church Fund can be liquidated in this way. Charges payable to lay impropriators, for instance, do not come under that particular section. And, as a matter of fact, when sales took place under that Act and vendors were paid in stock, as they often were paid, in stock at par, stock was sold to redeem all those superior interests with the single exception of these Church rents and tithes mentioned in the section. Now, what the noble Earl proposes by his Amendment is that the Crown&#x2014;that is to say the Woods and Forests Department, and, for all I know, the Inland Revenue Department&#x2014;which had to accept this stock, because I do not quite know what is meant by the word "duties" in the Amendment. It might apparently cover the claim of the Inland Revenue for unpaid succession duty. Then, again, the noble Earl apparently intends that all payments due to the Local Loans Fund and under the various Improvement Acts should be paid in the same way. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, said that it was reasonable to pay people in their own coin, even although they were a Public Department; but surely there is this important difference. The argument might be a sound one if anybody was obliged to take stock.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02275"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am not prepared to admit that. The option for cash is open to everybody, and it may suit certain individuals to wait, I do not think as long as twenty years&#x2014;at least I trust not&#x2014;but a certain number of years in order to be paid entirely in cash. I will grant this much to the noble Lord, that if there were such a case as that of a man who has to pay a quit rent of 25 per cent., and, in addition, has the remainder heavily mortgaged, he might be in a position where he would have to wait and receive cash; but I think it is also important to remember that so far as quit rents are concerned they are not in the strict sense the property of the landlord at all. Assuming the property bought, what was paid in respect of the purchase was the value less this permanent charge. I think, therefore, it is not reasonable to treat it as though it in any sense formed a part of the landlord's property. These departments who would have to pay are quite irrelevantly introduced into the matter. There is no reason in logic that I can see why they should be mulcted in this manner any more than all other superior interests which, I understand, the noble Earl does not intend to attack. I am afraid that for the reasons I have given we can hold out no hope of being able to accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02276"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> confessed that the last speech of the noble Earl had been one of the most depressing he had ever heard, having regard to the prospects of this Bill. This was not a question of relieving landlords, but of making the Bill work in an effective fashion. He knew perfectly well that if the Government insisted upon it this Amendment must be regarded from the point of view of privilege, and must be ruled out, but, still, the Government had at issue their own Bill, and before the Report stage he hoped they would consider these few facts. What was the position? They had stock in such a position at present that anybody hesitated to issue fresh stock. By the provision in the Bill for allowing landlords to take stock they were going to offer the strongest inducement to the Treasury not to face the enormous loss which they must face with further issues under existing conditions. Therefore, they started without any pledge that they would issue cash, while they had always in their hands the power of issuing stock. Who would accept that? Not the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0385"/>
<col>757</col>
poorer landlords and not those whom it was most desirable to relieve, but anybody who could afford to take stock and was anxious to be quit of his property at the earliest possible moment. In the case of every other man who took stock the Government made it absolutely certain that he must throw it upon the market at the earliest possible moment, and every &#x00A3;200,000 of stock which was so thrown upon the market would make a further issue by the Government possible only on ruinous terms. It was, therefore, not in the interests of the landlord, but in the interests of the working of the Bill, which must otherwise come almost to a halt, that he urged the Government to reconsider what seemed to him to be a very unwise proposal from the point of view of the authors of the Bill, and a most inequitable one from the point of view of those who were affected by Government and other charges. It was quite clear to all who knew the circumstances of a large number of these landlords that the Government would have to go a long way before they would urge landlords who could afford to wait to sell at a loss. He knew it was impossible to carry the Amendment unless it came from the Government themselves, and he would therefore urge the noble Earl before the Report stage to consider whether, without any unfair loss to a Public Department, he could not find something which would enable the issue of stock to be made a little more palatable, to grease the wheels of the Bill, and prevent what he feared would cause without doubt practically a stoppage in the operations of the Land Commissioners in a year or two from the present time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02277"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say one word with regard to this, because, although the form of the Amendment is to provide that Government Departments holding superior interests shall be paid in stock, the substance of the Amendment&#x2014;I am not putting now the point of privilege&#x2014;is to reduce the figure of 92, at which the stock is to be taken, to a lower figure, thereby to the prejudice of the Treasury. The proposition is that when a landlord agrees to accept part of the purchase money in stock he shall be able to impose without option upon Government Departments the duty of taking stock on the same terms&#x2014;it may be at a depreciation. It is one thing to say that a man may agree to
<col>758</col>
take stock as part of the purchase money, allowing him the option of refusing, but quite a different thing to say that another person, without being allowed the option, shall be obliged to take the stock. The only effect would be that the Government would be a greater loser than under the scheme of the Bill, because they would be obliged to have all their superior interests redeemed in a depreciated security. The real point of the Amendment before the Committee is that it does seek to vary the terms upon which the Treasury think they can afford to carry out the scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02278"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> ventured to doubt whether the financial effect would be quite what the noble and learned Lord foresaw. The Government had a great interest in maintaining the price of the stock, and one of the main objects of the Amendment was to prevent a great quantity of the stock being thrown on the market. The landlord must put his stock on the market, but the Government could afford to wait. Even if the Government were compelled to take a certain amount of stock against their will rather than that the landlords should be compelled to sell, it might well be to the ultimate advantage of the Government, as tending to prevent the continuous fall of a stock, which the Government were obliged to keep on issuing. Everyone acquainted with the financial side of the matter knew that at that moment even a comparatively small amount of stock being forced on the market would have a very serious effect on the price, and it might be that the Government would be the gainer in the long run if they were obliged to hold a certain amount of the stock.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02279"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It may be that it would be to the interest of the Government to accept stock, I do not know. But this Amendment proposes to make them do so.</membercontribution></p>

ALDWYN</member> confessed to feeling very great difficulty with regard to the Amendment, because he entirely agreed with what had been said by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill and by his noble friend behind him that if it was an Amendment proposed in the House of Commons it could only be proposed by a Minister of the Crown and could only be proposed in Com-

He was much in agreement with the argument addressed to their Lordships by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. He did feel that it was one thing for a landlord to accept payment voluntarily in stock but another thing for that form of payment to be forced on the Government or any other person concerned. It might be advisable, for the reasons stated by the noble Viscount on the Cross Benches, that the Government should allow landlords to make those payments in stock instead of cash, but he did not imagine without some legal provision to that effect that it would be possible for them to do so. He would venture to ask whether it might not be possible to insert a provision in the Bill in another place giving power to the Government, if they chose, to accept payment in stock, so as to prevent the difficulty which had been stated to their Lordships by the noble Lord, Lord Atkinson, as affecting the landlords, and also to assist in what, of course, the Government would desire to do&#x2014;to keep up the price of the stock.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02281"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member> pointed out that the Amendment dealt not only with pending agreements but with future agreements, and all the arguments of the noble Earl and of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor had been directed to the Bill as if it affected pending agreements only.

He felt that something must be done in the interests of
<col>760</col>
the smooth working of the Bill. If nothing was done they would be in this position, that the Government were going to offer landlords stock at a price at which they were going to refuse to take it themselves. That being so, could they expect that anybody would take stock?</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02286"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I understand the noble Earl does not press the former part of his Amendment which would have placed compulsion on the Estates Commissioners, or at least possible compulsion on them, to act without having any regard to the amount of cash which maybe placed at their disposal by the Treasury. But the noble Earl proposes, in the case of any estate to which the zone provision applies, that the estate may be divided up into sections, some holdings on which should be dealt with at once while other holdings would stand over, possibly for a considerable time. I speak with deference, and I should like to hear some further opinion on this subject from noble Lords from Ireland, but I should certainly have supposed that the idea of selling some holdings here and some there on a property, leaving the others in their present condition, would, even from the landlord's point of view, have been inconvenient if not in some cases impracticable. But from the point of view of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0387"/>
<col>761</col>
the Estates Commissioners I would say, without hesitation, that the proposal is not a practicable one. The present practice always has been to deal with the estate as a whole and to vest the holdings in the purchasers all at the same time, and the purchase money is then, of course, distributed <i>pro rata</i>. Take, for instance, the further case of the allocation of those charges which we were speaking about in reference to the quit rents. The burden thrown on the Estates Commissioners to allocate in respect of a particular holding in a case of that kind would be an extremely heavy one, and unless some noble Lord is able to combat what I have just said, we must maintain the opinion that the result of accepting this Amendment would throw the proceedings of the Estates Commissioners into such general confusion that we cannot venture to look at it. I think I see what the idea of the noble Earl was in moving it, but as a matter of machinery I think the new clause is an altogether impossible and impracticable one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02287"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> thought there was a grievance, but he agreed it was not very easy to see a way of remedying it. It might possibly be that there were some tenants on an estate to whom the landlord had agreed to sell for a certain sum and as to whose holdings everything was completed and ready, and there might be other tenants in whose cases, on account of boundary questions and things of that kind, there might be delay, and it did seem unreasonable to hold up the entire thing until the last man had been settled with. They might have a case of 100 holdings on an estate where the landlord and tenants in ninety-nine cases had agreed and nothing remained but to vest the property in the tenants, and it seemed rather hard that the balance of the purchase money should not be paid over to the landlord but should be held up for four or five or six months until some particular holding about which there was some difficulty had been ultimately settled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02288"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> was of opinion that the proposal of the noble Earl would restore the state of things which existed before the Act of 1903. The principle of the Act of 1903 was the sale of whole estates, whereas before that Act the practice was the sale of individual holdings. He asked whether it was really proposed to abandon the <i>in globo</i> sales under the Act of
<col>762</col>
1903 and revert to the old and condemned and obsolete custom which prevailed before that Act was introduced.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02289"><member>THE EARL OF KENMARE</member> said that was not his intention. In eighty per cent. of the cases the thing went through practically automatically, and he thought it might be possible that the portion of the estate with regard to which there was no difficulty might be dealt with speedily while the remaining portion could wait until everything was cleared up.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02290"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> did not think there was any suggestion in the Amendment to the effect that the old practice should be reverted to. The landlord sold his estate to each individual tenant, and the Estates Commissioners came in and said that the block which he had sold to all those tenants was an estate. That definition was purely for the purpose of paying the bonus. There was no desire to abandon that position. What was desired was that when everything was ready with regard to nineteen-twentieths of the estate the transactions between landlord and tenants should not be hung up until the last tenant had been settled with. It was not a reversion to any previous practice at all, but simply a provision to facilitate and accelerate payment in cases where there was no difficulty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02291"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: There is one question that I should like to ask, and I think it is a pertinent one. Is it not the case that the Estates Commissioners already have power to do something of the kind which my noble friend proposes, and that they do do it? As far as I have become aware of the practice of the Commissioners, in a case such as that spoken of by my noble and learned friend where nineteen-twentieths of the tenancies on an estate were all in order and the transaction with regard to those nineteen-twentieths was one which could properly be allowed to go through, I am under the impression that the Commissioners do sanction the advance and treat those nineteen-twentieths as a separate estate, reserving the one-twentieth, where there is a hitch owing to some complication, for future treatment. If that can be done under the present law, and if that continues to be the policy of the Land Commissioners, the necessity for compelling them by Statute to do what my noble friend desires seems to me to be considerably diminished. I should like to be

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02292"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> thought there was some misapprehension on the point. There was a provision in the Act of 1903 by which the Estates Commissioners could, in certain circumstances, take the consent of three-fourths of the tenants of an estate as binding the other tenants, but in no case did the Estates Commissioners deal with an individual holding without previously declaring that holding to be an estate. It was necessary, before the money could be advanced, for the holding to be declared an estate and in that way brought within the words of the Act of 1903. That Act provided in the case of a sale of an estate that when application was made for an advance under the Land Purchase Acts of the whole of the purchase money of the holding and the Land Commission were satisfied of certain things they should then sanction the advance, but before doing that it was necessary that they should declare the holding to be an estate. No advances and no payments could be made for individual holdings as holdings, and if each holding was declared an estate it would mean a reversion to the old state of things and a destruction of what was introduced by the Act of 1903.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02293"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am not able to say whether or not in the case of nineteen out of twenty tenants agreeing and being ready to complete the Commissioners may dispense with the conformity, so to speak, of the twentieth. Indeed I may say that this particular branch of practice is not within my ken, because the House of Lords is always forbidden from dealing with the Irish land system or the Land Act. But the proviso proposed by the noble Earl is none the less, to my mind, open to the gravest objection whichever view be taken of the existing practice, because here is a requirement that as soon as the provisions have been complied with "the Lands Commissioners shall forthwith sanction the advance and vest the holding in the purchaser,"&#x2014;that might apply to ten or twenty out of 100 holdings&#x2014;"and such part of the estate shall for all purposes of the Act be treated as if it had been declared a separate estate." In other words, you split up an estate previously composed of 100 holdings into ten or twenty or thirty separate estates, or, if necessary as many
<col>764</col>
separate estates as there are holdings upon it. That is what the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, referred to when he said it would be going back to the old practice. If I may conclude with an illustration, supposing there are 100 tenants and twenty of them have already got through in the month of October you would then have to proceed at once to hand over in respect of those twenty the aliquot portion, that is twenty-hundredths, of the money paid, and next month there might be five or ten more ready. All that would increase the business difficulties; and if it so happened that the estate was mortgaged for half its value, as I suppose estates in Ireland often are, the difficulties would be increased and you would have to pay off the encumbrances by driblets.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02294"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> pointed out that that was provided for at present by the very useful provision that they might pay off the prior encumbrances although they might not have enough money to pay off the subsequent ones.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02299"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said he did not think Clause 5 should be passed without some remark with regard to the bonus, which was now arranged in quite a different manner from what it was under the Act of 1903. When introducing the Bill in 1908 Mr. Birrell said that the bonus was intended to supply a cash medium to bridge over the possible inability of a landlord to accept the fair value of his estate. That was not quite a fair statement with regard to the description and object of the bonus. In the great majority of cases, when the costs, expenses, and losses incidental to a sale had been provided for, the balance of the purchase money and bonus, when prudently invested, produced very often an income considerably below the net income which the owner had previously derived from his estate. They were often told that with the bonus and the price the tenants gave, the landlord got out with a very great deal more than he was entitled to. He thought he ought to say something with regard to the Parliamentary history of the bonus. In the original Bill as introduced by Mr. Wyndham, it was for the purpose of aiding the sales of estates under the Act and making contributions towards the expenses incidental to the redemption of superior and intervening interests, the investigation of title, the distribution of purchase money, and for other matters. As the Bill was introduced, the bonus was referred to in those terms. Then there was a graduated scale put forward. On
<col>766</col>
that graduated scale being introduced Mr. Redmond commented on the scheme and said the effect of it would be to keep large estates out of the market because in such cases, as far as the bonus was concerned, there would absolutely cease to be any inducement to sell at all, and he went on to say that public opinion in Ireland had taken a very decided course in the matter; and he alluded to the National Convention, the Landlords Convention, and the Land Conference, and urged the desirability of making the bonus fifteen per cent. It was agreed that the bonus should be twelve per cent. That was passed without comment when the Bill of 1903 got to the Report stage. The bonus was now relegated to a sliding scale. Mr. Wyndham having adopted the twelve per cent. bonus, the money was allocated for that purpose and all parties agreed to the twelve per cent. The chief advantages in the bonus were, first, in so far as it was invested in capital it recouped the vendor for the costs and expenses of sale, which usually amounted to one year's purchase of the rental and in smaller properties a larger amount. Secondly, it assisted the vendor to wipe out arrears of rent if any existed. That fact was entirely in favour of the tenant. Thirdly, where the estate was encumbered it enabled him to recoup himself or to borrow money to pay for the loss of income which he must face for several years owing to having to continue to pay the full rate of interest on his encumbrances while receiving a lower income from his tenants. He ought to pay his encumbrances off at four or five per cent., and he was receiving three and a-half per cent. and in very few cases four per cent. from his tenants. The sliding scale had been much debated before. It was held that the bonus of twelve per cent. was improperly paid, so to speak, in the case of the Duke of Leinster's estate. That was a large estate, and it was always held that the Duke of Leinster had received a bonus of &#x00A3;80,000 by selling it. It was not the Duke of Leinster who was selling the estate, it was the trustees. That estate was in his county, and he assured their Lordships that that was not a fair argument at all, although it was always thrown in their teeth, because any noble Lord who was a trustee would naturally deal with the estate in that way. He did not think it was fair that that should be quoted in the way it had been. The sliding scale which had been adopted meant, of course, that the bonus was very
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0390"/>
<col>767</col>
much smaller, and he did not think that Clause 5 should be passed without some protest being made from their side with regard to it. He knew perfectly well what it was put in for; it was inserted to save the Treasury. As he had said before, this was a Treasury Bill with compulsion tacked on to it. It was all very well to say that they took the bonus and got large prices. The bonus enabled them to meet the arrears of the tenants and to pay for the expenses incurred. They felt that the sliding scale which had been adopted in the present Bill was not calculated to further the carrying out of land purchase in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02300"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said there was another objection to the sliding scale which was of more importance, and that was that the Act practically gave a large portion of the bonus to the tenant and not to the landlord. That worked out in an extraordinary way. Take, for instance, a tenancy of &#x00A3;100 a year rent; if the landlord sold at twenty-four years purchase the bonus was at four per cent. and he pocketed &#x00A3;2,496. If he sold at twenty-three years purchase he got six per cent. and he pocketed &#x00A3;2,438. The difference between the twenty-three years purchase and the twenty-four years purchase was only &#x00A3;58 to the landlord, but it was &#x00A3;100 to the tenant. The result of that in operation would be that the tenant would say to the landlord, "Take twenty-three years purchase from me; you will only lose &#x00A3;58 by it, whereas I will gain &#x00A3;100." Take another example. If the landlord sold at twenty-one years purchase he got ten per cent., and would pocket, where the rent was &#x00A3;100, &#x00A3;2,310. If he sold at twenty years purchase he got twelve per cent. and pocketed &#x00A3;2,240. He only lost &#x00A3;70 and the tenant gained &#x00A3;100. It was the same through all the scale; so that practically the landlord, owing to the scale of bonus, was put in the position that the tenant would press upon him in every case to take twenty-three years purchase instead of twenty-four, saying, "You will only lose &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;60, and I will gain &#x00A3;100." So far from the bonus being an inducement and a help to the landlord to sell, it would have a contrary effect owing to the sliding scale as they had fixed it. The tenant gained more by a lower number of years purchase than the landlord lost, and there would, therefore,, be a direct inducement to him to press the landlord to take a lower number of years purchase.</p>
<col>768</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02301"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> said it appeared to him there was another objection to the way in which the bonus was to be paid in the Bill. Under the Act of 1903 the bonus went to the tenant for life. There seemed to be a great difference of opinion on that point at the time, and Lord Macnaghten moved an Amendment to bring it into the corpus of the property and to the interest of the reversioner. He got a considerable amount of support, and the argument seemed to be a very strong one in that case in 1903 that the vendor was being bribed to sell the reversion. If that was so under the 1903 Act, it was infinitely more so under this Bill, because under the sliding scale the less the number of years purchase the vendor sold for the greater the bonus he placed into his own pocket. Therefore, it was a direct inducement to him to reduce the amount of purchase money, and to get the larger bonus himself. He called attention to that because it seemed to him that some protest ought to be raised on the matter. He had not ventured to put down any Amendment, but he would like to hear what His Majesty's Government had to say on the point. He thought something should be done upon it when they got to the Report stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02302"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships, I know, will not expect me to reply at any length. With regard to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, said, it is no doubt the fact that there are disadvantages and anomalies which are incidental to any and every sliding scale, but in our opinion they do not outweigh the advantage which comes from making the bonus higher as the number of years purchase is fewer. I confess I see no reason for doing what the noble Lord suggested as an alternative&#x2014;making the amount of the bonus depend on the amount of the total sum involved; because it seems to me where a large estate is sold on good and easy terms by the landlord that that landlord should get as large a proportion of bonus as a smaller proprietor who exacts the uttermost farthing he can get. With regard to the point raised by my noble friend on the Cross Benches, the question to which he drew attention is one no doubt of some real substance. There is an objection to doing what he desired to do&#x2014;namely, that in cases where the number of years purchase is small and the bonus is proportionately large it, or some
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0391"/>
<col>769</col>
part of it, should not be at the disposal of the tenant for life but should go into the corpus of the estate. The objection to that proposition I always understood to be that it would discourage tenants for life and so reduce the probability of sales, which we desire to encourage. But I do not deny that there is considerable force in what my noble friend said.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02306"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> moved to omit from subsection (1) the words "by reason of the death of the purchaser or the transmission of the purchaser's interest in a holding, or in pursuance of a declaration of the Land Commission under Section 15 of the Act of 1903 with respect to a sub-tenancy or a sub-divided holding." He said the clause was no doubt very useful so far as it went, as it allowed a fresh agreement entered into in certain cases to be dealt with by the Land Commissioners in the same way as the original agreement would be. It would, therefore, have the advantages
<col>770</col>
which attached to the original agreement. Three cases were mentioned in the section to which it was applicable&#x2014;by reason of the death of the purchaser, or the transmission of the purchaser's interest in a holding, or in pursuance of a declaration of the Land Commission under Section 15 of the Act of 1903 with respect to a sub-tenancy or a sub-divided holding. Why should these benefits be limited to these three classes of cases mentioned in the clause? Might there not be other cases where it would be equally applicable? For instance, there might be agreements for the interchange, enlargement, or rearrangement of holdings, or the alteration of purchase price, or where land had been taken compulsorily after the original agreement had been lodged. There might be other cases also which he could not think of for the moment which might be equally entitled to the benefit of this clause. There would also be the danger, if these three classes of cases were to be provided for, that unreasonable pressure might be put upon the vendors by the Commissioners threatening to make new purchase agreements in those cases which were not provided for by the clause, unless the vendors agreed to sell to the Commissioners themselves. They knew that pressure of this kind had been brought to bear upon vendors by the exercise of the Treasury power of stopping sales by refusing to declare the lands in a state in respect of which agreements within the Purchase Acts had been lodged, thus compelling the vendors to sell to the Commissioners instead of direct to the tenants. It was to obviate a hardship of that kind that he desired by his Amendment to make the clause generally applicable to all substituted agreements, and not merely to three classes of agreement to which it was at present restricted.</p>

number of cases to which the old bonus rate and the former purchase annuity would apply. I notice that the next Amendment of the noble Lord, which is, of course, an alternative Amendment, is drawn in considerably narrower terms. I do not know whether the noble Lord would desire to say anything on that. We cannot accept his first Amendment, and, as regards his second Amendment, I would say at once that I will consider before the Report stage whether it would be possible to accept that or something like it.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02309"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said that the noble Earl's promise that he would consider the matter and weigh the arguments addressed to him was quite reasonable and fair. The point made by his noble friend Lord Dunboyne was that it looked as if they were excluding some classes which were just as much entitled to attention as those in the clause. The noble Earl had not given the least indication of the kind of cases that would be open to objection. If there were a <i>bona fide</i> substituted agreement, why in the name of commonsense limit the clause to three cases? Why drag in three things, and say if the change was made in one of them it was to be regarded as correct and proper? Of what was the noble Earl afraid? He (Lord Ashbourne) was all against fraud and impropriety, but supposing the agreement were perfectly <i>bona fide</i>, open, and frank, published under the village cross and all the neighbours talking about it, which they would in any event, he could not see the objection of the Government on this point. The noble Earl said he would consider it. Well, there was a great deal to consider. He did not think there was any defence for keeping the drafting of the clause on the present narrow basis, but possibly his noble friend would be satisfied with the statement that the noble Earl would consider the point before Report.</p>

sanction of the Land Commissioners, and that would safeguard any case such as that suggested by the Lord Chancellor. He had been rather puzzling his brains about what class of cases could be in the mind of the noble Earl the Leader of the House or of the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, which they thought he was apparently dealing with. He had only mentioned a few cases that occurred to him. Other cases might arise, and it was a pity to restrict them, because they would be safeguarded to a very great extent by the fact, as he believed it to be, that all substituted agreements would have to be lodged with the consent of the Commissioners. He would like to get his original Amendment if the noble Earl would consider it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02320">He moved the Amendment with two objects. The first was to protect the zone system from the insidious and destructive attacks which had been made upon it by the provisions of this Bill. The second object was to provide a means of curing or removing the only blot which had been discovered in the operations of the zone system. He was afraid that his noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor and he would astonish each other, because his noble and learned friend had said he would be astonished if anybody contended that this Bill abolished the zones. That was exactly what he was going to contend, and he was astonished that any one should think it did not abolish the zones. However, as he knew the Lord Chancellor always maintained an open mind he did not despair even of convincing him that it did destroy the most valuable and distinctive features of the zone system. He (Lord Atkinson) ought to know something about the zones. He superintended the drafting of the clause which created them, and explained and defended them in the House of Commons. As the zones were, he thought, to many persons almost as unknown land as the Arctic Circle, where apparently two
<col>774</col>
travellers might arrive at the same destination without ever meeting, he thought it would be better that he should explain the zones from the beginning, their object, their operation, and their effect. In every sale under the Land Purchase Acts there were necessarily three parties interested. There was the vendor who sold, the purchaser who bought, and the State that lent the money. The great advantage of the zone system was that it established an automatic machinery which gave adequate security to the State and protection for the parties in remainder.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02321">He thought the case was best illustrated by figures. He would take the case of a tenant who held in the year 1880 at &#x00A3;100 a year. On the first revision his rent was reduced to &#x00A3;80 or less. On the second revision it was reduced to &#x00A3;64. Under the zone system in the case of such a rent&#x2014;second term rent as it was called, that was, one which had been revised twice&#x2014;the reduction was not to be less than ten per cent. and must not be more than thirty per cent. In point of fact the average reduction of rent upon those sales was 27&#x00B7;9, as was found in the last Report of the Commissioners, and the average number of years purchase 29&#x00B7;5. For illustration he would take the sale at a price which was the mean between the two extremes. It represented twenty per cent. reduction&#x2014; that was, instead of the rent being &#x00A3;64 a year, henceforth the purchasing annuity was to be &#x00A3;51 10s. That was what the tenant had to pay for having acquired the interest of the landlord. As the interest of the tenant in many parts of Ireland was as great as the interest of the landlord, and as the interest of both was pledged to the State, it was perhaps preposterous to say that in such a case the State was not secured by a payment of &#x00A3;51 10s. The reduction of twenty per cent. meant almost twenty four and a-half years purchase of the land. That was a fair price, and therefore the remainder was secured.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02322">That was the position in figures, and he would now take the position in law. The State in law had an additional protection&#x2014;namely, that the tenant must be a real tenant and the transaction must be a real and honest bargain. If the tenant were merely created for the purpose of a purchase, that was outside the whole business. If the transaction were not a genuine transaction there was no need to carry it through. So much for the State. What was the legal
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0394"/>
<col>775</col>
protection to the tenant? It was that by the tenth section of the Act of 1885 the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was vested in the Estates Commissioners. It was a roundabout business, but the net result, coupled with the provision of the Act of 1887, was that if the tenant had been defrauded or coerced or the landlord had been defrauded or coerced into a bargain which he desired to escape from, he had only to ask relief&#x2014;and he laid stress upon the word "ask" having regard to this provision&#x2014;in order to get the same relief that would be administered in the Court of Chancery. The agreement which he had been induced to enter into by fraud or coercion could be rescinded and set aside. There were many unfounded statements, but there could be none more unfounded than that either the State was betrayed into financing an unreal transaction or that the tenant was coerced into entering into a bargain which he did not wish to make. From first to last&#x2014;from 1869 until the present hour&#x2014;the landlord and tenant were always treated as persons who were capable of entering into bargains and protecting their own interests, neither party being treated as idiots, lunatics, or infants. The distinction of having treated them as idiots, lunatics, and infants entirely belonged to the present Government, because, according to this provision, though the tenant might desire that the contract should be carried out, though he had not asked to be relieved, though the State was amply secured, the omniscient Commissioners might step in and declare that the purchase price was too high, this intervention being disguised under the term "approval of the equity of the price"&#x2014;an expression, by the way, which had a peculiar history.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02323">As far as the phrase was concerned, it introduced a new element which had never been a test before in these transactions. He should have thought that any person who had any knowledge of Irish agrarian legislation would have hesitated before tearing up contracts. He was one of those &#x2014;he was afraid he did not share the opinions of some of his noble friends on that side of the House&#x2014;who approved of the objects of the Act of 1881 so far as preventing the increase of rent for improvements, and so far as it prevented arbitrary eviction; but he said, with a knowledge of thousands of cases, that the worst machinery that ever was invented
<col>776</col>
by mortal man for these worthy objects was the machinery of the Act of 1881, because in the place of doing what was done in every other case and saying that an unjust contract should not be carried out and putting a penalty on a man who made an unjust contract, it endeavoured to tear up all contracts and allow a herd of sub-commissioners to treat the relations of landlord and tenant without principle, without guide, without consistency, knowledge, or training, arriving at most preposterous results. If he wanted a witness to that he should refer to the evidence of Mr. Commissioner Bailey, who, at page 106 of Vol. V. of the Evidence before the Estates Commissioners gave a description as to how these men acted by rule of thumb; and wound up with the aphorism, "Where men are not sure of themselves they are, always moderate." That was an axiom to guide judicial investigation. He had never heard it before but once, and that was in the case of an action with respect to a promissory note for&#x00A3;100. The offence was forgery. Some of the jury were inclined to think, but were not sure, that the document was forged. Others thought the document was genuine, but were not sure, so, adopting Mr. Commissioner Bailey's principle, not being sure of themselves, they were moderate and brought in a verdict for &#x00A3;50. He should have thought that before the Government enabled anybody to tear up contracts made with men who were <i>prima facie</i> capable of making them, they should, at all events; remember that the destruction of contracts between landlord and tenant had in Ireland brought about such an intolerable position that the State was asked to spend &#x00A3;180,000,000 to drag the parties out of it Therefore, he said that this power which was given to the Estates Commissioners of saying that a price which landlord and tenant agreed to was not to be carried out, though the State must be secured, was an absolute destruction of the main feature of the zone system. That feature was that so long as the State was secured and the persons in remainder protected an advance must be made.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02324">The provision in this Bill was not that if they discovered the price was unfair or if they discovered the price was inequitable they might prevent the zones operating&#x2014;not at all. If they thought there were circumstances which they ought to inquire into they could dispense with the zones
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0395"/>
<col>777</col>
irrespective altogether of the result of the inquiry. It was a jump in legislation, So that on April 1 they could order an inquiry, and by April 30 it could be discovered that the thing was all straight and the State secured, and yet the zones had gone a month before. This provision altogether destroyed the zones, because the two main features of the zone system were that it automatically secured the interests of the State and the interests of the remainder men, and then made it obligatory upon the Commissioners to make an advance. That had gone. He thought it was a lamentable thing. No human being was more anxious than he was that the great social and agrarian revolution which was taking place in Ireland should be conducted to its legitimate fulfilment upon wise and honest lines, and the measure of his anxiety was the measure of his detestation and disgust that some of the provisions of this Bill had been introduced to thwart, to oppose, and to blast the hopes that had been raised for the termination of this miserable and desolating strife. Nothing in the Act of 1903 so conducted to the success of sale as the provision that once the parties came within the terms of the zones their contract must go through. All that they had to do was to contract on such terms that their contract came within the zones. This provision, however, left all to uncertainty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02325">He did not think any person who had the slightest practical acquaintance with the conduct of the conversion of peasant tenants into proprietors&#x2014;the handing over, as Lord Dunraven said, of the whole real property of the country from one class to another&#x2014;could contest for an instant that one of the main helps to that result was the zone system, Now it was assailed on four grounds. He would like to deal with them <i>seriatim.</i> Two of them were frivolous. One of them was most serious, and his noble and learned friend would not misunderstand him when he said that his speech was more likely than anything he had ever heard to shake the confidence in the relations of landlord and tenant in Ireland. He would tell his noble and learned friend why. They did not hear much of erosion. That was the Chief Secretary's discovery. That anybody could stand up in his (the Chief Secretary's) important position and say that holdings bought under these Acts were rendered less valuable and of less security to the
<col>778</col>
State by the progress of erosion was trifling with a serious subject. If it were a joke it was a poor joke. If it were meant to be a serious assertion, there was no foundation for it. He challenged the noble Earl to point to a single instance where a case came up on second revision where there was ever a penny abatement asked for on the ground that the holding had been diminished by erosion. Another cause of deterioration was said to be a land-slip. He did not know whether the noble Earl would confine himself to a land-slip or take refuge in a bog-slide. A bog-slide was really a work of imagination. They knew that the noble Earl at one part of his life was a poet, and, in the words of Shakespeare&#x2014;
<quote>"As imagination bodies forth</quote>
<quote>The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen</quote>
<quote>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</quote>
<quote>A local habitation and a name."</quote>
A bog-slide was an effort of poetic genius. Although <i>prima facie</i> it was not a thing to excite poetic fancy, yet it threw a glow about the meanest object. But there was no such thing. It had never occurred. He challenged the noble Earl to produce out of the 230,000 cases&#x2014;it was nearly 300,000 he believed&#x2014;in which rents had been fixed in Ireland, one single case where a reduction of rent was asked for on account of either a bog-slide, and, still more absurdly, a land-slip.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02326">What was the next ground? It was that some rents were fixed not by the decision of the Court but by agreement between the parties. Well, that was the strangest objection of all. He thought Lord Ashbourne would bear him out in saying that if there was one thing more than another on which Mr. Gladstone insisted in the Act of 1881 it was that there would be no litigation at all. It was as correct as most of his prophecies about Ireland. There would be no litigation at all, it was said, the moment the h adlines were set by the cases that were brought into Court; there would be universal agreement. Mr. Gladstone encouraged it and belauded it, and pointed it out as the real and wise course to follow. And now twenty-five years afterwards the men who took the advice were told that the rents which they agreed to had not that sacredness which belonged to the rents fixed by the Estates Commissioners. That shook the foundation of every rent fixed by
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0396"/>
<col>779</col>
agreement in Ireland, and a most lamentable and unfortunate objection it was. But what was still stranger was the Dunraven conference. At that conference were Mr. Redmond, Mr. Wm. O'Brien, Mr. Haddington, and that friend of consistency, Mr. T. W. Russell. The basis of that national treaty was that second-term rents were to be the basis on which landlords were to be bought out. He spoke in the recollection of the noble Earl. Why was not a distinction made then between rents fixed by agreement and rents fixed by decision of the court? If there were any real distinctions hitherto these Nationalist members whom he gave credit for having keenly at heart the interests of the tenancy of Ireland were false to their trust, because they made no distinction between rents that were fixed by agreement and rents fixed by judicial instrument. Why did they not? Because there was no real and solid distinction. If there had been they would have been the very first to have insisted that a difference should be made. They knew there was no difference and they were right.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02327">What were the figures? On first-term rents there were fixed by litigation 202,411 cases and the average reduction was 20&#x00B7;3 per cent., while 140,846 cases were settled by agreement, and the reduction was 17&#x00B7;6 per cent. That was, a tenant whose rent was &#x00A3;100 a year got &#x00A3;3 14<i>s.</i> less by agreement than he got in Court, but it was a better bargain for him to agree because he lost twice as much in litigation. But the number of cases in Ireland where rents were over &#x00A3;100 a year was comparatively few. In the whole of Ireland there were 490,000 holdings of which only 15,000 had a Poor Law valuation of &#x00A3;100 and only 25,000 a Poor Law valuation of &#x00A3;50. Taking the Poor Law valuation as two-thirds of the rent it would give about 34,000 tenants whose farms were over &#x00A3;50. That was, it would make a difference to them of &#x00A3;1 17<i>s</i>. The agreements which put &#x00A3;1 17<i>s.</i> more rent upon them were to be considered so iniquitous and unjust that they were not to be a basis on which the zones should operate. A more preposterous or unfortunate contention could not be urged. Therefore, he said that the case against the zones on account of the rent having been fixed by agreement was as flimsy as the erosion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02328">What was the last ground? He was
<col>780</col>
anxious by his Amendment to preserve the zones, and he had framed the Amendment so as to remove the only blot which had been discovered in the zone system. He was anxious to preserve the Act of 1903 because, as he had said, the more it was preserved the more certain would be the steady and wise progress to the legitimate fulfilment of that social revolution of which it had laid down the lines. He was anxious that any semblance of a blot which had been pointed out in the operation of the zones should be removed, and he had, therefore, put down the second part of his Amendment. He had observed in reading the discussion in another place that whenever the Chief Secretary for Ireland alluded to Weir's case &#x2014;the fraud of Weir's case, the iniquity of Weir's case&#x2014;the right hon. gentleman nearly wept. To think that any human being should be guilty of the depravity that had been revealed in Weir's case appeared to the right hon. gentleman to be something humiliating.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02329">What was Weir's case? It was this. A man whose tenants were in arrear for ten or eleven years made an arrangement with them that they should pay half a year's rent, that half a year's rent should be forgiven, and that two or three years rent should be added to the purchase money. Under the 35th section of the Act of 1896, in order that the tenant might start fair, it was provided that all arrears should be abolished and the tenant was to be able to enter into his new freehold free from all encumbrances. It was very difficult in the case of a tenant in arrear to prevent the landlord to whom the arrears were due saying: "If you will give me twenty-three years purchase I will forgive all arrears." What did the unfortunate Weir do? He said, "I will give you two or three years more purchase." He did not know that other noble Lords would agree with him, but he himself thought that was a mistake. It was quite clear it was intended that one year's arrears should be included in the purchase money, because Section 24 of the Act of 1903 stated that it would be legitimate to pay to the tenant for life one year's arrears out of the purchase money. He concluded that meant that a sum in respect of one year's arrears was in the purchase money, otherwise it would be very unfair to take it out. His Amendment restricting them to one year's arrears did
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0397"/>
<col>781</col>
little more, therefore, than provide expressly for what was provided impliedly by Section 24 of the Act of 1903.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02330">He was not at all indifferent to the fever that the principle of privilege had recently excited in another place. It appeared that if anything noble Lords did increase in any way the burden of the subject, no matter how indirectly, it was to be construed as a breach of privilege. He quite agreed that if the direct object was to increase the burden it was a breach of privilege, but as matters stood now it seemed to him that everything was looked upon as a breach of privilege that indirectly increased the burden of the subject. If one of their Lordships brought in a Bill and thereby increased the expenditure on printing, or spoke at the length he had done and in that way increased the gas bill, he supposed it might be regarded as adding to the burden of the subject, and therefore a breach of privilege. If it was thought that his Amendment fell under that ban he should be quite willing to withdraw it and bring it up as a new clause and let it take its chance, and to support his noble friend Lord Midleton in the proposal he had put on the Paper to strike out Clause 14.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02331">He only wished to say one thing in conclusion. He knew it would be said&#x2014;This only gives power to the Commissioners to do this thing, and of course the Commissioners in any event would do everything that is right; the Government intends this thing and the Government intends that thing; and the Commissioners wish this thing and the Commissioners wish that thing. It had always struck him, however, that of all the futile operations in which human beings could indulge none was more futile than discussing what the Government intended in a Bill that they brought in, except the object were to persuade or coerce the Government into using language that exactly expressed their intentions and nothing more. Therefore when the Government said they did not intend to give this power to the Commissioners his answer was that their intention did not matter but what mattered was what the Bill did. The Statute gave absolute power to the Commissioners to apply the zones or not whenever they had a suspicion that the security was insufficient, or that the price was too high.
<col>782</col>
The whole value of the system would be defeated if the Amendment were not carried. He ought to have said that in the case of second-term rents, the figures were quite as remarkable. The decisions by agreement were 78,880 and the average reduction 20&#x00B7;4. The second-term rents fixed by agreement were 49,529 and the average reduction about 17&#x00B7;5.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02332">He would like to know what any person could say against it if two litigant parties &#x2014;the landlords on one side and the tenants on the other&#x2014;instead of going into Court, employing persons to represent them and getting expert witnesses to prove the value of different improvements, should come to an arrangement and say, "Very well, we will agree. We are moderate men. We will divide the difference and select the figure that fixes the rent, instead of running all the risks of litigants." He submitted that he had proved his point that this proposal of the Government did destroy the substantial and beneficial features of the zones. Without doubt it overturned the zone system, and in doing that it caused a grave and serious injury to the progress of the agrarian revolution in Ireland.</p>

On such consent being given the said agreement shall be varied accordingly, and the application dealt with under the aforesaid subsection in its proper order as if the reduced sum had been the whole of the purchase money, and the application had been originally made in respect of that sum.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02334"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that as his Amendment which came afterwards included as one of its component parts the proposal which the noble and learned Lord made in his Amendment perhaps their Lordships would allow him at that point of time to make the remarks which he should make later on. He did not yield one inch to the noble and learned Lord in his respect for the zones. He knew more about the zones than did the noble and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0398"/>
<col>783</col>
learned Lord. He was present when the idea of the zones was first elaborated and when that idea was reduced into official language, and it was after that was done, and when the idea and conception of the zones had assumed pretty nearly the form they now held, that they were submitted to the noble and learned Lord for his consideration. He agreed with the noble and learned Lord in thinking that the zones were the foundation of the Land Act of 1903, and he would be the last person to support any proposal which would attempt in the least degree to interfere with the real meaning of the zones. When the Act of 1903 was brought into operation it came to pass that efforts were made to circumvent the zones. The first occasion on which the Land Commission saw that the zones might be circumvented was in the well-known Kinvara case. The circumstances of that case were these. Under the former Land Acts, before the Act of 1903 was brought into operation, an effort was made to effect a sale of that estate to the tenants. Under the old practice it was essential that that arrangement should be subjected to the consideration and inspection of the Land Commission, and that the terms agreed upon between the parties should be verified by a report of an inspector from the Land Commission. The inspector went down, saw the land, and reported.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02335">He did not carry in his mind the exact figures, but the following was a correct representation of the facts. The parties agreed to sell and purchase for, say, &#x00A3;5,000, but the inspector of the Land Commission reported that the estate was security for no more than &#x00A3;4,000, Then the sale proceedings stopped. When the Act of 1903 came into operation the parties agreed to sell and buy within the zones. On the basis of judicial agreements out of court, and relying on the zones as fettering the discretion of the Estates Commissioners, an application was made for an advance of, say, &#x00A3;8,000. Here was a case in which after a legal inspection it was declared that no more than &#x00A3;4,000 could be advanced with security to the State, but taking advantage of the zones an application was made for &#x00A3;8,000. The Estates Commissioners were told, as the noble and learned Lord had told their Lordships that night, that they had no discretion but must under the law advance the money within the zones. The Estates Commissioners in the interests of the public taxpayers endeavoured to see
<col>784</col>
some way out of the difficulty; some way of avoiding such a gross sacrifice of the taxpayers' money. It was then they invented the plan of not declaring the property an estate, of withholding their declaration of the property as an estate until they had made a full investigation. On investigation the transaction appeared in its true light. But now it has been I ruled by the highest Court of Appeal in Ireland that the Estates Commissioners acted illegally, and if the law on the point is not changed such attacks on the Public Treasury will be repeated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02336">The noble and learned Lord said that the zones were the foundation of the Act of 1903, and it was like touching the Ark of the Covenant to lay hands on them. He (Lord MacDonnell) said too that the zones were the foundation of the Act of 1903, but he also said that wherever there was an appearance or a possibility of turning a proper and correct law into a perversion of justice and into a fraud on the public revenue it was the duty of public officers to see that such a thing should not be carried through. Moreover it was the duty of the Legislature to see that the evils brought into notice in that way should be corrected, and that was what was proposed to be done on the present occasion. The noble and learned Lord stated that there were four reasons brought forward for this proposal, and he argued that they were futile and fatuous. One of those reasons was what the noble and learned Lord himself had admitted&#x2014;namely, that if the price agreed upon included more than one year's rent there was a sufficient and adequate ground for making an inquiry. The second reason was that the holding was a congested holding within the meaning of this Bill. That was nothing more than embodying in this Bill what already existed in a certain form in the Act of 1903. The first section excluded congested estates in certain conditions from the zone system, and the endeavour was now being made to see that in this respect there should be no evasion of the Act in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02337">The noble and learned Lord also objected that rent fixed by agreement or consent should not in any case be departed from. He (Lord MacDonnell) had endeavoured to explain the frauds against which precautions should be taken, and the present proposal was an attempt to embody in the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0399"/>
<col>785</col>
law these precautions. The noble and learned Lord made light of deterioration arising in holdings owing to bog-slides and things of that description. There had been instances recently in the West of Ireland of considerable tracts of country being completely destroyed by bog-slides. But bog-slides were not the only physical causes which occasioned deterioration in holdings. Inudation in the centre of Ireland had largely caused injury to holdings, and that was a matter which naturally ought to be taken into consideration before the State advanced considerable sums of money for the purchase of land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02338"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: Surely all that was considered when the rents were fixed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02339"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said these points seemed to him to justify the conclusion that on such a revision of the Land Act as was now being made the question whether the conception of the zones should be maintained in the original shape or should be subjected to modification was one for the consideration of their Lordships. When the conception of the zones was first introduced it was a novel conception, and he was willing to confess that any rents agreed to by consent before the Act of 1903 came into operation should be excluded. But since the Act of 1903 came into operation efforts had been made&#x2014;and having been made in the past would probably be made in the future&#x2014;to escape the restriction of the zones and to obtain advances upon estates for which the estates themselves were not really security. He thought they were bound in the public interest, in the interest of the general taxpayer, to take such reasonable precautions as they could to see that public money was not advanced on inadequate security. That was entirely in accordance with the conception of the zones, and he thought the precautions now proposed to be taken were within the original idea of the Act of 1903.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02340"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell, designated the Kinvara case as a fraud, and also stated that he knew more about the zones than the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson. The Kinvara case was not a fraud, and the parties were acting quite within legal limits. The way in which the judicial rents came about was that the parties had settled
<col>786</col>
out of Court, and that was a system well known in Ireland. The noble Lord opposite not only said that he knew all about the zones, but that practically he had settled them.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02342"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> begged the noble Lord's pardon. At all events, the noble Lord said the Kinvara case was a fraud. How on earth could that case be a fraud when it was within the purview of the Act of 1903, with the framing of which the noble Lord opposite had as much to do as a great many noble Lords. When the noble Lord got up and stated that the case was a fraud, he knew as well as possible that the tenants settled their differences out of Court. That was the very point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, who said the reason why a great peace had come over Ireland was that the system had led to the settling of differences out of Court. He did not follow the object of the noble Lord, Lord Mac-Donnell, at all. He thought it could only be to throw grit into the mill and to cause dissension in their Lordships' arguments for no reason whatever.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02343"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member> did not suppose that anybody was a stronger champion of the zones than himself. He could not imagine that the 1903 Act or any other Act could possibly work with ordinary speed without some kind of zone system within which it must be assumed the bargain was fair and should be carried out. He did not wish particularly to argue that point, because as he endeavoured to explain on the Second Reading he was so firmly convinced that nothing their Lordships' House could do would make this into a workable Bill that he did not take much interest in any Amendments which could be moved. All he had risen to say was that he thought the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, was quite correct in the allusions he made to the Land Conference, of which he (Lord Dunraven) had the honour to be chairman. The noble and learned Lord had alluded to the four gentlemen who represented the tenants at that conference, but as those gentlemen could not, of course, say anything in their Lordships' House he would like to be very guarded in what he said on the matter. He could not remember the exact words of the recommendation on
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0400"/>
<col>787</col>
the Land Conference, but the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, was quite correct in saying that they took second term rents as being the proper basis of income. He thought the exact words they used were "Second-term rents or their fair equivalent." The noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, had shown that judicial rents fixed by agreement were the fair equivalent of rents fixed in Court, but at the same time he (Lord Dunraven) would not like to let that pass without saying that that was not stated in the Land Conference report. All they said was, "Second-term rents or their fair equivalent," their idea being that a fair equivalent would be first-term rents graded to second term rents&#x2014;first-term rents fixed after 1896&#x2014;and non-judicial rents, of course, graded also. Whether rents fixed out of Court were to be considered a fair equivalent was a matter he did not wish to go into. They were not absolutely said to be a fair equivalent by the Land Conference, although probably that was the case.</p>

More particularly I am surprised at the speech of the noble and learned Lord, who I think has left the House, exhausted by the effort of a lifet me. My surprise is due to the line which the noble and learned Lord took in treating this as a matter of the very first importance. The noble and learned Lord, as we know, can make a most able speech on any subject, but I confess that this very simple and prosaic clause hardly seemed to me to demand the treatment which it has received from him in an oration at any rate adequate in length and delivered almost in the manner of Shiel or Grattan. I ascribe the fire which the noble and learned Lord introduced into his speech to two reasons. In the first place, he is convinced, I think, that we have some deadly design against the zones as an institution. He founds that, I suppose, on the fact that some Parliamentary representatives in Ireland are well known to dislike the zone system. Why he should assume that we who have continually stated the contrary, and have shown by the manner in which this clause is framed that we do not intend to depart from the zone system, share that extreme view I confess I am altogether at a loss to understand. The second reason is the profound, and, as I think, most unrea-
<col>788</col>
sonable mistrust which the noble and learned Lord has shown, not only in this debate, but in many previous debates, of the Estates Commissioners.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord accuses us of leaving a discretion to the Estates Commissioners. We are charged with believing that the Estates Commissioners will act like reasonable and sensible men. The noble and learned Lord desires to see the Estates Commissioners fettered and handcuffed by every conceivable restriction which can be placed in an Act of Parliament because of that mistrust which has become an absolute obsession with him, and which I am certain it is hopeless to attempt to remove by argument. The noble and learned Lord dwelt at some length on the fact that the interest of the State was in all cases secured under the zones and I suppose he would say in almost any agreement, by the fact that the subject that is parted with by the sale is only the landlord's interest and that the tenants' interest always remains available in the background. I do not think that is an argument which can be generally used. In relation to a single case you may use that argument, but you cannot venture to use it as regards a class of cases simply because the State cannot in practice sell up any number of tenants, and if the cases became frequent where the security provided by the landlord's interest as represented by the purchase annuity became inadequate the State could not as a matter of practice really recoup itself by putting the tenant's interest into the market. The noble and learned Lord, with a purpose which I could not entirely follow, devoted no small part of his speech to a criticism of the operations of the Land Act of 1881. He spoke of the preposterous results arrived at by the judicial fixing of the rents. Yet those preposterous results, if you please, are the precise basis on which the zone system is founded. The zone system, to which noble Lords attach, and I think rightly attach, great importance, is founded on the fact that judicial rents were fixed. I may remind noble Lords opposite that when there is a talk about the monstrosity of the system of dual ownership and the fixing of rents they should remember that without that system of the fixing of rents no conceivable zone system of land purchase could have been introduced in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02348"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl can develop that argument at any length he pleases on a future occasion. My noble friend behind me has relieved me from a considerable part of my task, because he stated very clearly and fully what are the reasons which made him think there were other cases besides the cases of one year's arrears which ought to be considered by the Estates Commissioners. What has happened under the zone system? The zone system is, as all will agree, of the greatest value, and I am prepared to go so far as to say that by its ease and labour-saving qualities it may be regarded as the basis, the groundwork, of the operations of the Act of 1903. But as always happens in such cases people look out for loopholes, and try to evade. It is precisely the same kind of thing as occurs when it is a question of charging a duty, whether it be a death duty or a duty on some commodity. People look round to see if they can avoid it. There have been some cases quite open and above board to which I do not desire to attach harsh terms, because they have been carried out within the law of the land. But they have constituted evasions of that law, and as such in our opinion ought to be prevented. It is believed by those who ought to know that those cases are considerably more frequent than any published results enable us to say. I think it stands to reason it must be so, because when it is found out that, for instance, by going through the simple process of handing over a sum of money to the tenants you can increase the sum you receive in the way of
<col>790</col>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02349"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> said that stress was laid on that point in a previous debate, and he then asked if they could be given some specific cases. Perhaps the noble Earl could give them some instances now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02350"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: There is the case of Crosbie's estate. In that case the owner agreed to sell to the tenants for a certain price. This was an open and above-board transaction, because the owner himself said he had done it. It was arranged between him and his tenants that some further sums should be added to the aggregate price, still remaining, of course, within the zone limits. The total was then treated as the purchase money. As soon as the sale was completed the owner was to pay to the tenant the additional sums. Those sums certainly did not form part of the real purchase money in the strict sense, but the owner got his twelve per cent. bonus on those additional sums and the tenants received in addition to an advance of the actual purchase money a sum in cash. There was no concealment about the case. It was a perfectly legal transaction, and may have been carried out in a great number of other cases. But I think all your Lordships will agree that it is a case which somehow or other ought to be stopped, because an advance of public money ought not to be made on those terms and in that manner. I repeat once more that the sole object of this provision as it stands in the Bill is to close these loopholes. Certainly the Estates Commissioners have no desire, although the: noble and learned Lord will not believe it, to stop the working of the zone system. We thought it safe and reasonable to leave a discretion to the Estates Commissioners, on that subject. My noble friend behind me has adopted a different course, and attempts in his Amendment, to which, perhaps by leave of the Committee, I may allude, to deal with the matter on other lines. He has mentioned various cases in which inquiry is necessary. I am not sure he covers the whole ground, because I fancy there might be cases in which there were considerable arrears which would demand investigation by the Estates Commissioners, but yet would not fall within my noble friend's list. There might be
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0402"/>
<col>791</col>
cases where the arrears were so large that even though they did not enter into the actual purchase scheme, they might show that the tenant was not the kind of person to whom an advance of public money ought to be made. That is a case which hardly seems to me to be covered by my noble friend's Amendment. Then there is the further point which was alluded to after most of your Lordships had left the House before we adjourned. I refer to the case in which under the sliding scale for the provision of the bonus a tenant for life would accept a too low number of years purchase in order to pocket the bonus on the larger scale. That is just the case where&#x2014;supposing it to be impossible or undesirable to prevent that by saying that the bonus on the low scale ought to be added to the corpus of the estate and invested for the benefit of the remainder man&#x2014;the Estates Commissioners might interfere with advantage. I think I need not dwell any longer on this clause. I notice that the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, has put down a somewhat different Amendment from that proposed by the noble and learned Lord opposite. I do not know whether the noble Marquess proposes to move it or not, but in any event perhaps I had better defer any further observation until I see what course he takes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02351"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> did not know that the speech which the Leader of the House had just addressed to their Lordships had entirely emancipated them from the difficulties in which they stood. They had heard a most able and convincing speech from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, which had made it perfectly clear that he for one conceived that the whole benefit of the Act of 1903 would be lost if the zone system were to be done away with. The noble and learned Lord gave them admirable reasons why, in the majority of instances, the cases which might be admitted under the clause as the Government had presented it should certainly not be admitted. In the closing part of his speech the noble and learned Lord made the suggestion which was embodied in the Amendment he had laid before the House, that they might, by limiting the matter to one year's arrears, stop one of the objections which had been raised to the zone system. There, again, they were, faced, as they had been faced ever since they began discussing this Bill,
<col>792</col>
with the possibility that an Amendment which was perfectly legitimate and <i>bona fide</i> would be ruled out in the other House on the ground of privilege. Their Lordships would realise that to say the price should include one year's arrears might be held in the other House of Parliament to be an appropriation of funds to a purpose not contemplated in the Bill as it came before their Lordships. That was a very serious matter. To put it perfectly plainly, if they should embody the Amendment of his noble and learned friend in the Bill and that view should be taken, the Bill would be returned to their Lordships' House as it stood and their Lordships, so far as he knew, would have no further power of considering and altering the clause. He thought it would be not merely a great blemish in the present Bill, but would be practically abrogating one of the two main principles on which the Act of 1903 was based, and on which it had achieved the phenomenal success which they were discussing that night. They were faced on the other hand with the counsels of those who assured them they were in favour of the zone system. Perhaps he might be allowed first of all to allude to the speech, and the Amendment which had been put on the Paper, by the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell. He would wish to say on behalf of those Irish landlords and others who were in favour of the Act of 1903 that he thought they owed a deep debt of gratitude to Lord MacDonnell who, he believed, was in theory in favour of the principle of zones, for having put his views and the method by which he made good that theory on the Paper of their Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02352">What was the principle of zones? It was, as the noble and learned Lord had explained, the withdrawal from the purview of the Commissioners of the main agreements between landlord and tenant based on decisions of Land Courts, which were held binding upon the landlord so long as it was a question of rent, but which some people did not wish to hold binding upon him when it was a question of purchase. It was also protective of those voluntary agreements between landlord and tenant which were the main object of the promoters of the Act of 1881, and of no one more so than Mr. Gladstone himself. After hearing him cheer the sentiments of Mr. Gladstone to the echo time after time, he regretted to hear the Lord Chancellor
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0403"/>
<col>793</col>
deliver himself a few nights ago in direct opposition to the views of his former leader. He said that in no spirit of disrespect, but merely to show what effect the passing of time had upon the minds of men. These transactions were withdrawn from the Courts not from any desire to benefit one party or the other, but simply to avoid litigation and that ill-feeling which had characterised so many of their dealings in land in Ireland. How did the noble Lord the late Under-Secretary propose to deal with these matters? First of all, he proposed that they were to be within the purview of the Court again for fresh settlement. He proposed that when application was made for an advance of the whole purchase money of any holding the Land Commission might make inquiry if they were satisfied that the judicial rent was fixed by agreement or consent and not after judicial inquiry in Court. The Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant told the House of Commons a few weeks ago that the number of judicial rents fixed by agreement and without inquiry by the Court amounted to one-third of the whole rents of Ireland. Therefore at one fell swoop the noble Lord proposed to bring within the purview of the Court again one-third of the whole rents in value which were left to be settled in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02353"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said he should like to add, after the word "consent" in his Amendment, the words "after the passing of the Act of 1903."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02354"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> pointed out that the Act of 1903 did not appear in the noble Lord's Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02355"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said he would like to add it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02356"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> was very glad to hear the noble Lord say that. As the Amendment stood, however, one-third of the whole rents in Ireland fixed by agreement and consent were to be brought within the purview of the Estates Commissioners, who were especially, under the Act of 1903 and the zone system, not to have regard to those agreements and consents. If they looked at subsection (<i>c</i>) in the noble Lord's Amendment their Lordships would see that the Land Commission might make inquiry if the holding was a congested holding "within the
<col>794</col>
meaning of this Act." Under the Bill nearly one-third of the whole land of Ireland was to be added to the congested districts. Therefore, as regarded one-third of the whole area of Ireland the-land was to be taken away from the zone system and was to be added to the system which was to come under the purview of the Estates Commissioners. Under subsection (<i>b</i>) of Lord MacDonnell's Amendment on the Paper it was laid down that the Land Commission should come in if the price agreed upon included more than one year's arrears of rent. He distrusted altogether these reservations made as regarded one year's arrears of rent. How were they going to tell what was rent and what was arrears? Everybody who had had to deal with Irish tenants knew there were many cases where the tenant would gladly give additional years' purchase if told that it was to wipe off his arrears. He did not know how it would be possible for a judicial body to decide whether a sum of years' purchase which came within that zone which was regarded as exempted from criticism by the Act of 1903 was made up of years' purchase, or of arrears added to a minimum number of years' purchase together making up a sum which left the tenant with something like twenty-five per cent, less to pay than he had to pay before.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02357">Then in Lord MacDonnell's Amendment there was subsection (<i>d</i>) which empowered the Land Commission to interfere if since the judicial rent was fixed the holding had permanently deteriorated owing to physical causes beyond the control of the tenant. He believed there had been certain cases of land slides, but the objection he had to the words was that they might force the Estates Commissioners to consider themselves bound to make a complete inspection of each holding to see whether such physical deterioration had taken place. The noble Lord might be one of the advocates of the zone system, but he had certainly in the. Amendment he had put before the House dissembled his love for that system to such an extent that his proposals would unquestionably bring within the purview of the Commissioners half or three-quarters of all the estates which might hereafter be submitted to them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02358">Noble Lords had heard arguments in the other House as to the effect of the zone system on the tenants, but he did not
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0404"/>
<col>795</col>
think they need trouble themselves very much about them. Mr. Dillon had told them that most of the rents had been 40 per cent. higher than they ought to have been for purposes of purchase. He spoke with all respect of the opinions of those who guided the counsels of the national directory, but he could not help remembering that the national directory on September 1, 1908, by a unanimous vote denounced the zone system as fatal to the interests of the tenant. That was at a meeting in Dublin, and it was published before all their eyes as showing the necessity for a complete change, in the new Bill, from the Act of 1903. During the months of September and October, 1908, after that unanimous denunciation by the national directory, 46,500 applications were put in, involving &#x00A3;13,500,000, to buy under the zone system. Those applications amounted in all to nearly two-thirds of the whole applications to purchase made during thirty-eight years under the previous Purchase Acts. That was within two months after the severe pressure of the leaders of the Irish party to try and prove to Parliament that the zone system was a betrayal of the rights of the tenants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02359">From the point of view of the British taxpayer there, again, he could not help feeling that the Lord Chancellor insufficiently voiced the feelings of his colleagues in the persuasive speech he made to their Lordships a few nights ago. He thought the noble and learned Lord went far beyond justice or expediency in the view which he expressed. In alluding to the attitude of the Lord Chancellor and that of his colleagues he was thinking of the days when Mr. Gladstone and the leaders of that Party tied themselves to a proposition that a Land Court in Ireland would lead to the settlement of a number of these cases, and that after that the vast majority of agreements would be made without recourse to a Land Court and by the voluntary system of which the Liberal Party had always been the exponents. But the Lord Chancellor spoke with sorrow of the agreements made by consent, which had not been made the subject of judicial inquiry, and which, he urged on behalf of the taxpayer, should be made the subject of judicial inquiry before they become the subject of purchase.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02360"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> said he thought the voluntary system was abso-
<col>796</col>
lutely essential to the working of the Act of 1903, and he had never said a word to the contrary. What he said was this, "The zone system is admirable, but if you have rents fixed by agreement which have not been the subject of judicial supervision then it does not necessarily follow that they will give the security which you would have under a zone system if there had been judicial supervision"; and he also said, "In a few cases it may be necessary to re-open the inquiry." That was all he said.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02361"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> rejoined that in other words what that really meant was, "You can touch the decision of the Land Courts, but you cannot touch the voluntary agreement between landlord and tenant." But that did not represent the view of the Chief Secretary. The view of the right hon. gentleman was that granted they had been to the Court, because they still had an opportunity of going into the Court every fifteen years, they could not be certain they had reached the bedrock at which the nation would be wise to purchase. The Chief Secretary used words which were unfortunate, and for one in his position unwise. The Chief Secretary said that by a scheme in Ireland by which rents were reduced every few years the second-term rents would not be fixed rents. He (Viscount Midleton) objected to the words "were reduced" every few years. They were "revised" every few years. The Chief Secretary had no right to say that the scheme of any Bill in Ireland was to prevent rents being reduced every few years, and that they could not take the present rent as being a fair margin on which to purchase. The right hon. gentleman also said very strongly that one-third of the judicial rents was fixed out of Court by agreement, and he urged that as a reason for the present Bill. What he (Viscount Midleton) would urge upon their Lordships was not to accept the view that everything that was done must necessarily be done under the sanction of a Court or else it could not possibly have proper validity for a permanent settlement. They had had a good many measures lately which proposed to bring all the relations between man and man in this country under the purview of a Government official. The old doctrine of the Liberal Party was that individual freedom and liberty was the maxim on which the Constitution of this country was
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0405"/>
<col>797</col>
founded. That was being completely changed. It used to be said of a distinguished President of the Board of Trade who had brought in a great Act of Bankruptcy that his idea was that the greatest happiness that could come to his fellow citizens was to become bankrupt under his Bill. In the same way it seemed to be the view of many heads of Departments in the present Government that the greatest happiness of their fellow citizens was not voluntary agreement between man and man as to property, hours of labour, or the conditions of their service, but official sanction. It would be a bad day for Ireland if they went back on the Act of 1903. He believed this clause would bring them back to the necessity for the interposition of the already overworked Estates Commissioners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02362">Speaking from the point of view of the British taxpayer, he urged on the attention of their Lordships the following facts. The first was that whether there were arrears added to the rent or not, so long as they had the protection of the zones they knew that between twenty to forty per cent. of the rent, the rent already reduced by thirty-five per cent. all over Ireland, would be reduced in the case of the new rents or annuities which went as security to the State. The second point was that they had believed that the immense interest of the tenant, an interest which in the course of the last year, as a number of statistics would show, had been sold in the case of those who had already become purchasers for sums varying from five to thirty years purchase. That was an additional security to the State; and beyond that, again, there was the fact that under the existing rents, reduced as they had been since 1881, the farmers of Ireland had found themselves able to raise their contributions in the Savings Banks by nearly 250 per cent. That at least proved that the existing rents, now to be further reduced on purchase by twenty-five per cent., had not, on the whole, been felt oppressively by the tenantry. If there had been hard cases such as had been alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, he thought the matter for astonishment was that there had been so few in such a great number of transactions. He did not deny that they might find here and there a case in which the landowner and tenant had together
<col>798</col>
agreed to put aside a certain number of years' purchase of arrears which probably, if they were submitted to that House, would not pass muster. If such extreme cases required to be provided against he did not think members on that side of the House would in any way make difficulties if it were held that the Estates Commissioners should state a case for the Supreme Court where they believed there was fraud or some undue action. Words to that effect would require to be carefully considered, but what he urged upon their Lordships was not to break down the zone system by what seemed to be a very small change but which might result in completely paralysing that which had gone so far to carry through the most difficult negotiations with success and satisfaction to both parties. He did not believe that he was arguing this case on behalf of the landlords. He believed that the zone system had become a sort of bedrock for both parties in Ireland. It had saved delays and expense and also litigation and bad feeling, and if they replaced it by the old system they must also denude the, new system of that which had gone so far to render the Act of 1903 the most successful piece of legislation which they had seen in their time in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02363"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> said it was of the utmost importance in debates, especially in Committee, to appreciate what was the controversy between them. This discussion had ranged over the Act of 1881 and all the old, unhappy controversies that were passed. What they were discussing was an Amendment to a clause relating to the zone system. Why should they multiply controversies, so far, at all events, as intention was concerned? When noble Lords on the Opposition side of the House Said they wished to maintain the zone system, they, on the Government side said, and had always said, that they also wished to maintain the zone system. Noble Lords might say that their words did not provide for that, but let them show that it was so. But what was the use, if he might respectfully say so, of denouncing an opinion which they repudiated and which they had all along said they took no part or lot in? As far as his speech of the other evening was concerned, what he said about the zone system was contained in three minutes of a speech covering the whole ground.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02364">What he said was this, that the zone system
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0406"/>
<col>799</col>
was a system under which they prevented the necessity for re-opening valuations by accepting as a proper basis for a purchase price the judicial rents that had been fixed, provided the number of years' purchase was within certain limits. He believed that he had accurately represented what the zone system was. He then said that he wished to maintain it, but that when there were cases in which it was necessary to re-open the question they should not be bound by the purchase prices being within the zone, because in the circumstances they were not a fair security for the Government advancing the money. No one wanted to tear up agreements. It was not a question of tearing up agreements. The landlord and the tenant made their agreement and if they liked to carry it out themselves they could do so; but when they came to a third party, the State, and asked to have a certain sum of money advanced, it was reasonable that the State should have an opportunity of saying whether they thought the security was enough. That was the whole proposition. While they were perfectly willing and entirely agreed that within the zones the purchase price agreed by the parties might in the ordinary course in the great multitude of cases, be accepted and acted upon as it had been in the past, experience had shown that there ought to be in some given circumstances an opportunity for the State to investigate whether, in that particular case, the bargain was a sufficient security for the State. That was all they had said; they had said nothing more of any kind. That was not tearing up agreements.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02365">The curious thing was that all those who had been most severe in their criticism were themselves in favour of re-opening the zone in some circumstances. The very Amendment they were considering proposed to re-open the zone. His noble and learned friend who initiated the discussion proposed that it should be re-opened if the purchase money included more than a year's arrears. Therefore he did not object to re-opening the zone system in some circumstances. The noble Lord, Viscount Midleton, had said that if there were such things as had been referred to they ought to be included in the case stated for the opinion of the superior Courts. But it was only questions of law that could ever be stated in that way. Questions of fact were never stated for the opinion of a superior Court. The point was that if
<col>800</col>
cases of fraud or of duress, or reasonable suspicions otherwise should come to the knowledge of the Commissioners they should be at liberty to make inquiry into the circumstances which now they could not do, and if they thought the circumstances justified then they might refuse to make the advance in the interests of the State and in the interests of security.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02366">He had stated the controversy between them. There was no controversy between them as to maintaining the zone and none upon the point that in some circumstances the zone ought to be re-opened. But there was a difference between them as to the nature of the circumstances under which the zones might be re-opened. The Amendment of the noble and learned Lord proposed that it should be so if the purchase price included more than a year's arrears. They did not think that sufficient. It would not deal with the particular case given by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, a case in which there was an agreement between landlord and tenant for a particular price; they then agreed to add a year or two years purchase, and then, after the money had been advanced, the two years was to be handed over to the tenant and yet the landlord was to keep the twelve per cent. bonus upon that whole sum. Surely every man who wanted fair and honest dealing and proper and reasonable protection for the State would say that that case ought to be open to consideration and inquiry and ought to be checked. But the noble and learned Lord's Amendment would not allow them to go into a case of that kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02367">It was not the case that his noble friend behind him (Lord MacDonnell) proposed to re-open all rents which had not been the subject of judicial investigation. The noble Viscount was entirely mistaken about that. There was a power to do so if the Commissioners were satisfied that those questions existed. Let them understand the proposition. Was it to be said that these zones were never to be re-opened at all, or would they not be better occupied in inquiring under what circumstances they ought to be re-opened? Their proposal was put in general terms. It left it to the discretion of the Commissioners as, indeed, many things in the Irish Land Act of 1903 were left to the Commissioners&#x2014;men every one of whom was appointed by the present Government's political opponents, and who,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0407"/>
<col>801</col>
he believed, possessed the confidence of the community. At all events if noble Lords did not like these words let them suggest some better. The words were&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Land Commission are satisfied that circumstances exist which, in their opinion, necessitate inquiring as to the security for the advance or the equity of the price."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02368">He ventured to think that was a modest proposal on the part of those who had to advance the money. It was a modest proposal that they should be at liberty to inquire in regard to the security for the money they were asked to advance when special circumstances were brought to their attention pointing to the necessity for making an inquiry. He deliberately refrained from expressing any opinion as to the previous Acts or as to the general success of the last Act. He did not grudge any of its authors its success; but he respectfully suggested that they ought, in a businesslike way, to look at what the Amendment meant and what the clause was to which it was an Amendment, instead of placing rather a heavy censure upon the Government for intentions which they really did not harbour and had not the least intention of carrying into effect either by Act of Parliament or otherwise.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02369"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> did not think the Lord Chancellor did justice to the Amendment. So far as he could follow him, he had justified an Amendment enabling the Commissioners to inquire as to the security of the State and had said nothing to justify their inquiring as to the equity of price.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02370"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> said the criticism was perfectly just. The whole debate had proceeded upon re-opening the zones, and re-opening the zones with a view to security. That must be his excuse. He would say only one word about the other side. This clause contained a proposal authorising the re-opening if the Land Commissioners were satisfied that circumstances existed which, in their opinion, necessitated inquiry as to the security for the advance or the equity of price. He had dealt with the security for the advance. As regarded equity of price, it might apply in two ways. The words were taken from Mr. Wyndham's Act of 1903. It included two things. In the first place under this Bill or any system in which the bonus went to the credit entirely of the tenant for life and
<col>802</col>
did not become part of the purchase money there was a danger that he might sacrifice the ultimate interest, that of the remainder man, to his own interest. If, for example, he were an old man who would not live very long he might be tempted to sell at a price which was unfair to the remainder man because he would get twelve per cent., or whatever the percentage was, into his own pocket upon the purchase price. That was one thing which ought to be the subject of protection. There was another thing&#x2014;where there was unfairness or duress; for example, unfairness as between the landlord and the tenant. Where there was such unfairness the State ought to say, "We will not sanction a transaction which it based upon oppression of the tenant by the landlord." It was held by the Irish Courts that the language used by Mr. Wyndham's Act about equity of price only related to the first of those kind of things that it did enable the Court to protect the remainder man against the tenant for life but did not entitle the Court to protect the tenant against oppression by the landlord. It was their intention that if there were circumstances showing unfairness, fraud, or duress in either of those relations, in those cases the zone might be re-opened.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02371"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he was very glad to have given his noble and learned friend the opportunity of supplementing his argument. The noble and learned Lord now said that they were to inquire into prices because the price might be too small and hit the remainder man. His answer was that that was provided for by the scale of the zones; it could never occur within the zones. The words "equity of price" were not used in the Act of 1903 with regard to any case within the zones at all. The words were properly used in order to protect the interest of the remainder man in cases falling without the zones, and for the obvious reason that the scale in the zones protected the remainder man. The words "equity of price" had never been interpreted to mean that the landlord and tenant might not contract. The tenant was already protected against fraud or duress by Section 10 of the Act of 1903. The difference in that Act was that the tenant himself must complain of the fraud or duress, whilst in this Bill where the tenant made no complaint and was perfectly willing to carry out the agreement the Estates Commissioners were to step in and say, "No, we disapprove of the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0408"/>
<col>803</col>
price." That was illustrated by the very first case in which the Commissioners endeavoured to raise the question of what was the meaning of the words "equity of price"&#x2014;namely, the King-Harman case which arose under Section 5. The Estates Commissioners sought to extend the words "equity to all parties concerned" to include the fixing of rent, or rather the determination whether the price was adequate. It was decided the words did not mean that, but referred to equity as regarded the remainder man. He said the State had no right, when legislation had left the way open to any tenant who complained of duress or fraud, to step in. The particular case to which he referred was a most remarkable case. The tenant and the landlord came into Court and both asked the Commissioners to validate the agreement. The power the Commissioners claimed was, in defiance of the tenant and the landlord, to say whether or not the price was equitable. That was what he (Lord Atkinson) protested against. He said they had no right, where the landlord and tenant agreed, to come in and stand between them. They might have the right to say the State would not protect them, but they had no right to say that they were lunatics or idiots. As regarded the noble Earl who led the House, he did not expect that the noble Earl would have risen so soon, or he could assure him he would not have denied himself the treat of listening to him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02372"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02373"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said the only thing he would ask of Lord Crewe was an apology to the memory of Shiel and Grattan, to whom he understood the noble Earl had made reference in connection with his (Lord Atkinson's) speech. He accepted with the greatest humility, of course, the censure thus mildly conveyed from such a master as the noble Earl. He understood also that the noble Earl had said he thought he (Lord Atkinson) had exhausted himself in his speech. He could assure Lord Crewe that that was not so, and he would endeavour during the progress of the Committee to prove that it was not so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02374"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said that the Crosbie case had been mentioned. He could give the House the history of the
<col>804</col>
Crosbie case. The sum involved was &#x00A3;40, which was included in the purchase money for arrears. That was the custom and was allowed to be included under former Acts. It was a mistake on Mr. Crosbie's part. Mr. Crosbie gained no advantage out of it and got no bonus. He asked their Lordships if that was an instance in which they should be asked to re-open the zones&#x2014;a wretched little case like that where the landlord made a mistake. Was that fair?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02375"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member> said he felt in some difficulty about the clause. There were four Amendments which they were obliged to discuss, more or less, at the same time. The noble and learned Lord had one Amendment, his noble friend Lord Londonderry had another, his noble friend opposite had a third, and his noble friend Lord Midleton wished to leave out the clause altogether. None of these propositions seemed satisfactory. The noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, had admitted that perhaps the wording of the clause in the Bill might be considered a little too general, and rather pressed noble Lords on the Opposition side of the House to suggest other words. He (Lord Dunraven) suggested that if the Government thought the wording of the clause rather too general, it lay with them to suggest better words. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, had told them the tenant was amply protected aleady against intimidation or duress, because it was always open to him to complain. He did not see how, if pressure was put upon the tenant he could, in the circumstances, possibly complain. He did not know whether such a thing had occurred, but it was conceivable that a body of tenants or a tenant head over ears in arrears&#x2014;perhaps five, six, seven or eight years&#x2014;might be told that the only escape from that disagreeable situation was to agree to give a larger number of years purchase for the land than they knew the land would be worth. How was it possible for them to complaint? The only result would be that they would be put back into a still worse position, and remain as tenants owing all these arrears. That was the kind of case he imagined the Government wished to guard against. They wished to put words into the Bill that would guard against cases of that kind without leaving everything, as was now done, to the discretion of the Estates Commissioners. If they put in words embodying that, he would support them.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02376"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: We on this side of the House are ready to accept, without reservation, the assurances that are offered to us from the Benches opposite that noble Lords on those Benches have no desire to get rid of the zones. But we do submit that the clause, as it now stands, or as it was drawn, virtually deprives us of the protection which the zones now afford. I think there is a rather simple way of testing that proposition. As my noble friend Lord Midleton has told the House, there are people in Ireland who have persistently endeavoured to undermine the zones. They have constantly denounced the zones, they have made it their object to get rid of them altogether, and this clause has been acclaimed by them because it is regarded by them as calculated to effect their purpose. What does the noble and learned Lord say? He has no wish to destroy the zones, but&#x2014;I forget whether the expression was his or Lord Crewe's&#x2014;it is said that under the present law there are loopholes through which people can pass who desire to bring about improper transactions. What are these so-called loopholes, these opportunities for evasion? There is the question of arrears. My noble and learned friend Lord Atkinson has put a clause on the Paper dealing with arrears in what I should have thought was a very sufficient manner. But if it is the case that there are other instances of the improper addition of arrears to the purchase money, I, for one, am quite ready to consider words that may be designed to meet these cases. Then there is another category, one to which I attach great importance. The noble and learned Lord referred again to-night to the case of agreements entered into by the parties out of Court. I referred to the actual expression he used the other evening, because there was some doubt as to that. The noble and learned Lord described these agreements as being judicial only in form. I do not think, if I may venture to say so, that that was an entirely appropriate description of those agreements. They are very numerous, and they are agreements entirely creditable to the parties who have entered into them. Many of these parties are weary of litigation. They have watched and they have seen what kind of reductions of rent are insisted upon by the Land Commissioners, and having, as they thought, arrived at the standard prevalent in the particular locality to which they belonged they have said "We will agree without going into Court, and we will fix
<col>806</col>
rents on the level which prevails in the neighbourhood." I think it would be a monstrous thing that parties who have entered into these agreements should be penalised, and, as it were, singled out by this clause for differential treatment as against parties who have gone into Court. If you desire to have a special exception in favour of holdings that have suffered from physical causes such as erosion and land slides, we will welcome an exception of that kind without any controversy. There remains one other category, the category of cases in which there has been fraud, duress, or, I think it was suggested, collusion between the parties. I want to ask whether it is not the case that the Courts have already held that the Commissioners not only have the right, but that it is their duty to inquire into the validity of all contracts of tenancy and of all purchase agreements entered into by the parties, and whether the Courts have not also held that it is the duty of the Commissioners to refuse their sanction where any coercion has been suspected. I believe I can refer your Lordships to passages in the <i>magnum opus</i> of Mr. Cherry, one of the Law Officers of the Crown, in which the propositions I have thus stated are clearly set out. There is, I am told, at this moment a Regulation&#x2014;I believe it is Regulation No. 143&#x2014;in which it is laid down by the Commissioners that fair rent agreements may be set aside on the ground of fraud or surprise. That, again, is to be found, upon page 143, of the great work of Mr. Cherry.</membercontribution></p>

My point is that all those so-called loopholes are either stopped up, or could easily be stopped up. In order to stop them up it is not necessary to give the vague, wide, undefined powers conferred by this clause as it now stands; and therefore, as an earnest of our desire to begin the process of stopping up loopholes I shall be delighted to vote with my noble and learned friend who moved this Amendment.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02387"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the noble Marquess opposite had stated that he was willing to consider proposals to prevent the occurrence of other difficulties in the zone system, and he (Lord MacDonnell) desired to propose the Amendment on the Paper, with the exception mentioned. He had endeavoured in his previous remarks to explain to their Lordships how the difficulties and abuses had occurred in reference to agreements fixed out of Court&#x2014;agreements that had not been subjected to the process of judicial examination. He had explained to their Lordships, or endeavoured to explain, how this difficulty was met by the adoption by the Estates Commissioners of the plan of refusing to declare the property an estate until they were satisfied that the difficulties they were endeavouring to remedy did not exist. Under that plan, which the Commissioners adopted, the Act of 1903 had had the phenomenal success to which noble Lords had alluded in the course of the debate. Under a recent judicial decision the Estates Com-
<col>810</col>
missioners were now declared to be not competent to adopt the procedure which they had adopted during the last five years and under which proceedings had been conducted without friction and with great success. As the Commissioners were now prevented from adopting that line, he proposed that where the judicial rent had been fixed by agreement or consent after the promulgation of the Act of 1903 the Estates Commissioners should be qualified, when they saw sufficient reason, to make inquiry with a view to seeing whether the property was security for the advance which was called for. He made no proposal that they should inquire into the equity of the bargain or the equity of the contract between the vendor and the tenant. He dealt with that in a subsequent Amendment which he proposed to Section 20. In regard to the first part of his Amendment, it was only concerned with judicial rents fixed by agreement or contract after the passing of the Act of 1903. Before the passing of that Act there was obviously no inducement to the parties to enter into any arrangements which were calculated to injure the public revenue. There was no question of zones then, no question of advances; consequently there was no object in going behind the date of 1903. He therefore wished to limit it in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of his Amendment to transactions which had taken place since the year 1903. The next point he proposed was that the Estates Commissioners should be entitled to inquire whether the estate contained congested holdings. Congested holdings did not come within the zones. By the Act of 1903 they were excluded from the zones and it seemed to him the fact of that exclusion was sufficient reason why an inquiry should be made. His last reason was connected with the physical causes of deterioration, which the noble Marquess opposite seemed to think might form reasonable ground for inquiry.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02402"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved the insertion of a new clause after Clause 14. He apologised for a mistake in the printing of the proposed new clause on the Notice Paper, and said it should read as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"No advance shall be made under the Land Purchase Acts to the owner of a congested estate not situated in a congested districts county unless such estate has been brought by the Land Commission under section six of the Act of 1903."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02403">He said that no congested estate at the present time could be perfectly or efficiently improved unless the Estates Commissioners had the full powers which Section 12 of the Act of 1903 conferred upon them. He was dealing now with congestion outside the scheduled or congested districts, not with congestion under the Congested Districts Board. In order to effectively improve an estate possessing congested holdings, it was absolutely essential that the whole of the internal arrangements of the holdings should in most cases be altered. In congested holdings, as their Lordships well knew, much of the land was in detached plots and much of it was separated from the nucleus of the holdings. The essential part of the work of improvement was the consolidation of holdings, bringing the various parts together, and in such a way consolidating the holdings as nearly as possible within a ring fence. That could
<col>814</col>
only be done if the authority dealing with congestion had the powers which Section 12 of the Act of 1903 conferred on the Congested Districts Board. If a landlord sold a congested estate to his tenant the tenants thereupon became the owners of their several holdings, and it was impossible to effect any improvement except with the consent of all the tenants concerned&#x2014;a consent which the Estates Commissioners had, up to date, found it practically impossible to obtain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02404">If their Lordships would consult the recent Report of the Estates Commissioners, they would find that from the beginning of the operation of this Act&#x2014;namely, from November 1, 1903&#x2014;to March 31 last, the Estates Commissioners were only able to deal with twenty cases of congestion. The result was that, of course, outside the scheduled districts the congestion had continued; estates had changed hands, and congestion had been perpetuated in all those estates which had been so sold. The object of his Amendment was to enable the congestion to be relieved, and in order to enable the Estates Commissioners to do that he proposed that all congested estates should in future be sold to the Estates Commissioners under Section 6 of the Act of 1903; that no longer direct sales should take place between landlord and tenant of these congested estates. He trusted he had made it clear that if a direct sale between landlord and tenant took place no power conferred upon the Estates Commissioners to spend money on these estates would be effectual for the object in view, because it would be necessary before the Commissioners could effectually interfere that they should obtain the consent of every individual tenant on the estate to place the whole of their holdings in hotch-potch, as it were, and let the Commissioners deal with them as they pleased. That was practically impossible to expect, once a sale was completed; so that if their Lordships did not accept the proposal he made they would perpetuate congestion everywhere outside the scheduled areas. Within the congested areas the Congested Districts Board had the power which he claimed now for the Estates Commissioners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02405">Landlords would naturally ask themselves, "Are we to accept the prices which the Estates Commissioners offer us for our estates? Are we to have no appeal
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0414"/>
<col>815</col>
from the price or against the arrangement proposed by the Estates Commissioners?" That was provided for in the second portion of his plan, which they would come to later; in such a case there should be a tribunal to which a landlord could appeal in the event of his being dissatisfied with the price offered him by the Estates Commissioners. They might say that that was compulsion. He admitted at once that the tribunal was common to the proposals which he now made and the proposals which might be made under a system of so-called compulsion, but he did not apply the word "compulsion" necessarily to his scheme. It was giving the landlords an opportunity, if they disagreed with the Estates Commissioners, of having the matter submitted to an impartial arbitration. Every landlord in Ireland, with few exceptions, was anxious to sell his property, provided he could get a fair and equitable price. It was a question of price with most Irish landlords, and he was anxious that the price to be given to them in order to settle once for all this great question should not only be fair but generous. Where there were two parties to a transaction, one anxious to buy and the other anxious to sell, the ordinary common sense procedure was to refer the matter in issue between them to the arbitrament of an impartial, intelligent, and competent arbitrator. That course was adopted in commercial transactions, and he did not see why it should not also be applicable to matters connected with Irish land. Proof in support of his proposals could be found in the evidence given before the Dudley Commission, but he preferred to submit this matter to the judgment of their Lordships on the plain issue. If their Lordships, however, did not adopt this plan, the relief of congestion outside the congested districts became a matter of impossibility. It would be for them to determine whether that congestion outside the scheduled districts was to continue a scanda to every observer or whether they would take advantage of this proposal. It might not be all that their Lordships wished, but at all events they might suggest such an improvement in the proposal as would give effect to the purpose he had in view.</p>

The proposal is that no direct sale shall take place in any part of an estate which is described as a congested estate under the definition of the Act of 1903. The noble Lord spoke of a congested estate as consisting of congested holdings, but, of course, there may be a great number of holdings on an estate of this kind which are not congested, and it certainly does seem a strong order, although the noble Lord may be right in thinking it necessary, entirely to abolish direct sales in cases of estates of that kind.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02414"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURI</member> said he did not like to let the opportunity pass without saying a word in support of Lord MacDonnell's Amendment. There was a great deal to be said for this Amendment. He could take noble Lords to places in Ireland and show them cases where owing to the fact that the estates had been sold direct from landlord to tenant congestion was stereotyped for ever, and it had passed out of the possibilities of any Board like the Congested Districts Board to deal with it. The same thing really applied outside the congested districts, as Lord MacDonnell had pointed out. Of course, there were difficulties. His noble friend proposed to extend this to the whole of Ireland. He also saw a difficulty in understanding exactly what "congested estate" might mean in the rest of Ireland. Though he thought there was a great deal to be said for this Amendment, at the same time he did not suppose that his noble friend would press it when he saw that noble Lords were not quite prepared to accept it in the form in which he had presented it to the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02415">On Question, Amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02416"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved another Amendment to follow Clause 14. He said the last proposal he made had reference to the relief of congestion outside the scheduled areas. This proposal dealt with the relief of congestion within the scheduled areas, because that congestion could not possibly be relieved unless the untenanted land necessary for migration and for the enlargement of holdings was secured. This proposal substantially meant that in the province of Connaught untenanted land should be earmarked for the purposes of the Congested Districts Board. It was clearly proved in the evidence given before the Dudley Commission that there was not in the province of Connaught sufficient land to relieve the congestion in the existing scheduled areas, and the strongest evidence was brought before the Commission to show that day by day the stock of available land was being reduced and was passing into the hands of other than the congested people. He had the honour of being a member of that Commission, and the Commission came to the unanimous conclusion that if the relief of congestion was to be anything substantial, or to be anything more than a mere name, it was necessary to take immediate steps to forestall the further sale and
<col>818</col>
disposal of grass lands in the province of Connaught. It was a question of whether their Lordships were going to relieve congestion, or whether they were going to allow the land to get into the hands of the landless men. That was a point in which he had ventured in the Minute which he wrote to ask for a decision from the Government. It was a very difficult matter upon which to come to a decision; the decision had not been come to in the Bill as it stood, and he proposed this provision therefore with a view of challenging a decision on that point. If no decision was come to and if matters went on as they were, it would be better at once to say that the relief of congestion was a pious opinion which could not possibly be carried out in a practical way. In this instance also his drafting might be defective, but he trusted he had made his meaning clear. The grass lands in Connaught ought to be earmarked for the relief of congestion. In securing that land he thought the poor people who had small holdings in the neighbourhood, either on the land itself or in the immediate neighbourhood, ought to be the first to be helped. They had always been looking upon those lands, and if they were not satisfied it would be difficult to bring migrants into the neighbourhood. If they did not secure those grass lands now, it would be much better if they said "We will not go on any longer with the relief of congestion." They might spend money in Connaught on local industries or improving small holdings, and so on. That money, no doubt, would be well spent for the time, but it would not relieve congestion. A few years hence the same trouble would recur, and they would be faced with this difficulty in an even larger degree than now. On their Lordships' decision rested the question whether or not the relief of congestion in Connaught was or was not to be successful.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02425"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> moved to omit from paragraph (<i>a</i>) the words "the tenant resides on the holding, or." He said that this was the first of a series of Amendments which stood in his name. He had in addition put down at the end an Amendment to leave out the clause altogether in case the Government were unable to meet him in any way or the question of privilege was again raised with reference to this matter. The Amendments which he proposed ought to commend themselves not only to the noble Earl, but also to the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, because they aimed at
<col>820</col>
increasing the discretionary powers of the Estates Commissioners. That was an object which the noble Earl and the Lord Chancellor had very much at heart. They had both twitted noble Lords on that side of the House with not placing sufficient confidence in the Estates commissioners, but noble Lords opposite did not quite understand the attitude of noble Lords on his side of the House in regard to this matter. They did not want the discretionary powers of the Estates Commissioners increased in cases which referred to the zones or to parts of grass lands, because they thought the Estates Commissioners were perhaps too keen and too zealous to protect the interests of the State, and that in doing so they might, perhaps, neglect to consider other interests as fully as he and his friends would like. But when it was a case of increasing the security of the State, they were all in favour of giving the Estates Commissioners full discretionary powers; at least he was. It had been remarked that this clause limited very much the advances which were made under the Act of 1903, by which the class of larger tenants was limited as regarded the benefits of the Act. This clause proposed to limit it in a great number of different cases, and to have all over Ireland small tenants of about ten acres, which would mean a very low standard of living, and a very low standard of agriculture. He could not help thinking that these large tenants with capital should have an opportunity of acquiring their holdings, and that at any rate it should be left to the discretion of the Estates Commissioners to judge whether these men were suitable persons to be given an advance under the Act. The Amendment which he now proposed was meant to meet the case of tenants who had two holdings which were not worked together, but he did not think it was a specially important one, and he rather moved it to make clear the trend of his Amendments. If, however, the noble Earl was not prepared to accept it, he would withdraw this particular Amendment.</p>

The discretion of the Estates Commissioners where it might conceivably be used for the public interest requires the close attention of the noble Lord, but where it might be used for the benefit of private interests he desires to enlarge it to the utmost possible degree.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02435"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member> moved to strike out the provision that in the case of any farm for which a purchasing advance of &#x00A3;3,000 was required, "a substantial portion" must have been "tilled in each of the five years next preceding the date of the agreement." His object in bringing forward this Amendment and two others
<col>822</col>
which stood in his name, was, he said, that he had a sort of paternal interest in this clause, because during the passage of the Act of 1885 he was enabled to get a section inserted which facilitated the sale of large farms to their occupiers. The suggestion made by His Majesty's Government that the advances from the Land Commission should not be larger than &#x00A3;5,000 at their discretion might be a wise one, but it must be remembered that in the future in Ireland as the landlords disappeared from the country, as he thought would be the case, the rural district councillors, the men of influence in different districts, would be selected from the class of large farmers. They would be the men to whom the people would go for advice and assistance. Paragraph (<i>b</i>), which he proposed to omit, brought in a rather absurd restriction. The clause provided that no advance exceeding &#x00A3;3,000 could be sanctioned under the Land Purchase Acts unless "a substantial portion of the holding has been tilled in each of the five years next preceding the date of the agreement." He yielded to nobody in his opinion that tillage was a very valuable and useful adjunct to all farms in Ireland, but he thought it rather absurd to make it a <i>sine qua non</i> that a portion of a farm must not be sold to a man unless a "substantial portion" of the farm was in tillage. First of all, it was very difficult to define what "substantial" would be. A man might have a farm of 400 acres, and it might be very advisable that he should have fifty acres of tillage, but the. Estates Commissioners might hold that that was not "substantial" and that he ought to have 200 acres in tillage, and they might refuse the concession which otherwise they would make to him. On the other hand, a farmer might agree with his landlord, before the actual completion of a purchase, to till what the Estates Commissioners might consider a substantial portion. Having tilled it for five years, with the consent of the landlord he would apply to the Commissioners and would receive his advance, and the next year the whole of the tillage would go back to grass. That would lead to collusion between an owner and his tenant. He could not see the advantage of paragraph (<i>b</i>) and he suggested to the Government that it would be far better to leave the Estates Commissioners to deal with particular applicants who came before them and when the Commissioners' inspectors had viewed the land.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02438"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member> could not help thinking that Clause 15 was very much against the interests of the large farmers in Ireland. He detected in this and in almost every other clause an attempt to fine down large farms and to have small ones. The restrictions which the Government proposed to put on farmers, that they should be bound to till a certain amount of land, was a great penalty to put on men, and it was calculated to also damage the grazing interest. He happened to be an owner of some large farms himself, and he would be sorry that those farms should be under penalty of being tilled after they had been used for grass for years. It was a very unfair and unjust clause on the large tenant farmers in Ireland. Their Lordships knew, those who had tenants in Ireland, that it was an enormous advantage to have here and there throughout the country a large farmer who farmed his land in a better way, and who could be of assistance to his neighbours. He looked upon this clause as the thin end of the wedge to reduce, first of all, the owners and then the large farmers, so that in the long run the landless men who were about would get the land. They could not make a rule-of-three arrangement about land. It was an open secret that at the present moment land bought, and for which terminal annuities had been paid, had come into the hands of one man, but the land was now going into the hands of one owner, and they could not prevent that going on by any Act of Parliament. He hoped that Lord Castletown would press his Amendment to this part of the clause as being unfriendly and unjust to the large farmers in Ireland.</p>

He appealed to the Lord Chancellor whether the paragraph would not admit to the privilege of purchasing farms for &#x00A3;3,000 if a substantial portion was tilled. But the clause as a whole, it was true, knocked out the large grazing farms. County Limerick, where he came from, was largely a grazing county; they valued their grazing farms but they were most anxious to encourage tillage. He appealed to his noble friends not to press their objection, because, as he had said, paragraph (<i>b</i>) would encourage tillage and do no sort of harm to the grazing farmer. It would not damage the grazing farmer nor deprive him of any privileges which would be conferred upon him otherwise under this Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02446"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> said that to insist upon occupiers of land who had large grazing farms breaking up their land for tillage, would strike a very serious blow at what he regarded as the leading agricultural industry in Ireland&#x2014;namely, the breeding of stock. In England and Scotland occupiers of large farms spent a large amount of capital on them. They also kept a good bull or a stallion, and were thus of enormous advantage to all the surrounding districts. He looked with considerable apprehension on the breaking up of any large farm. He did not own any farms in Ireland at present, although he had considerable small property in
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0419"/>
<col>825</col>
England. Small occupiers of land round about the property of well-to-do farmers in this country would be the first to object to anything being done to depreciate in any way the great advantages to agriculture and to themselves which were obtained through the occupiers of large farms. Agriculture required capital, and if a man had a large holding he could develop it, but they would be virtually restricting a man of money from becoming an occupier of land if they insisted that he should break it up into tillage. It would not only be detrimental to the large occupier, but would be still more injurious to the breeding of stock. He would tell their Lordships what Ireland owed to this important industry. In a report on the trade in Irish ports it was shown that live stock was the largest export, and amounted in 1908 to a total estimated value of nearly &#x00A3;15,000,000, an increase over the exports in each of the years from 1904 to 1907. Surely in a country which was supposed to be poor like Ireland, when they had figures like that it seemed to be the height of folly to do anything which could injure that industry. It might be said that these exports only benefited the large graziers, but he denied that. This exporting of cattle encouraged the breeding of stock of all sorts by the smallest of farmers. The smallest farmer would breed his calf and sell it to a larger farmer; the larger farmer would in his turn sell it to the export grazier, and consequently the money brought into Ireland from this must permeate throughout those districts. He asked the noble Earl the Leader of the House what was the object of breaking up these grazing lands? His noble friend Lord Monteagle lived in a great cattle-breeding county, and spoke with authority. The noble Lord said that to break up grazing land and to put a large amount of it under tillage would do no harm; but he doubted whether in the great grazing counties such as Connaught, where the cattle trade was a great industry, they would endorse Lord Monteagle's remark. But what was the reason that these grazing lands were to be broken up? Was it not to reward the evil doers? Was it wise to break up farms and lay down tillage which required a great deal of labour? Much also depended on the climate, and Ireland it was known in some parts had a wet climate. Was it possible then, even in the most favourable circumstances, that if they laid down a certain amount of tillage the land would bring in
<col>826</col>
anything like the return it would from grazing? Did they think that the people living in the great grazing districts of Galway and those parts of Ireland which were devoted to cattle breeding would be so foolish as to break up their land and turn it into tillage? He did not believe it. He trusted that his noble friend who proposed the omission of paragraph (<i>b</i>) would press it to a Division. He agreed that to reject the whole clause would require very careful consideration, but any step that would go to ruin the graziers and the great cattle industry in Ireland would be an exceedingly unwise one for their Lordships to take.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02447"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ARDILAUN</member> said it would be very unfortunate to make compulsory the tillage of a portion of a farm. At present the paragraph was absolutely vague as to what it meant, what portion and to what extent. The words were merely "a substantial portion." In his part of the country it would be absolutely impossible to carry out the improvement, if they called tillage an improvement. There were no men to do it. The young men had mostly gone to America and to other parts of the world. Therefore, to cause men to break up their lands would be penalising them, because they could not get people to carry out the tillage. It was also perfectly clear, from his experience and that of others, that tillage was not profitable, and they only tilled as far as was necessary in connection with their stock. Tillage would not pay like grazing farms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02448"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member> said there were two large portions of grass land in Galway neither of which could be tilled. Two-thirds of one was rock, and no matter how willing a man might be he could not possibly till it. As to the other portion, he resided among that land himself and any man who tried to make a profit by turning it into tillage would become bankrupt.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02449"><member>LORD BARRYMORE</member> reminded the Committee that the whole tendency of this land legislation must be to drive the present landowners more and more out of the country, and to leave behind them no class to take their place and to lead public opinion, except the large farmer. In the interests of high policy, therefore, Parliament ought to endeavour to keep the large farmers in their present position rather than discourage them.</p>

<col>827</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02450"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I desire to say one word with regard to paragraph (<i>b</i>) which is under discussion. Let us, in the first place, see quite clearly what it does. The clause of which it forms a part lays down a limit of &#x00A3;3,000, with a discretion to go to &#x00A3;5,000 beyond which the Land Commission shall not go. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) says that the &#x00A3;3,000 limit may be exceeded where a substantial part of a farm has been under tillage. My noble friend Lord Monteagle said that at first sight it undoubtedly appeared to let in tillage farms, and thereby to introduce a measure of elasticity in the clause. But what does parargaph (<i>b</i>) really in effect do? It virtually says that large holdings shall not be admitted to the privileges of the Bill unless a substantial part of them are broken up. That is a deliberate incitement to till land which would not otherwise be tilled, to till it for the purpose of obtaining the advantages of this section. Is that a wise policy? I entirely agree with what has been said by noble Lords who have a right to speak because they have practical knowledge of this question. Is this a wise condition to attach to the admission of large holdings? Those of us who have had any experience of agriculture will be unanimous in saying that agriculturally there is no greater crime than to break up fine old pasture land. An agriculturist would regard the breaking up of old pasture very much as an amateur of rare china would regard the breaking up of old S&#x00E8;vres; and to put a premium an land adapted for one purpose being used for a different purpose seems to me the height of folly. There are two principles involved in this clause. There is hostility to grazing land, and there is incidentally the policy of hostility to large farmers. I entirely agree with what has been said as to the place which the grazing lands occupy in the Irish agricultural system. The question does not arise in so many words upon paragraph (<i>b</i>), but it is the policy which runs through the whole of this clause. You want to get rid of the grazing lands to which Irish agriculture owes so much, and you want to obliterate, as far as you possibly can do so, large occupiers of land in that country. The clause will therefore have a twofold effect. It will have an effect upon Irish agriculture, and incidentally it will have an effect, and a most unfortunate one, upon Irish society, because when the landlords have disappeared it will be to these large farmers&#x2014;these substantial men who are
<col>828</col>
able to hold their own at the fairs and who are not at the mercy of the local dealers&#x2014;to whom the Irish agricultural community will look to maintain a certain amount of agricultural efficiency. I venture to think that this paragraph (<i>b</i>) is a most ill-advised one, and if my noble friend Lord Castletown goes to a division, I shall vote with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02451"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad that the noble Marquess opposite has brought the discussion back to the actual terms of the clause rather than the supposed design which lies behind the words. The clause provides that &#x00A3;3,000 should be an ordinary advance, thereby reverting to the policy of the Land Acts before 1903, and it makes two exceptions, classified as (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). But it seems to me that noble Lords are going far when they attribute to paragraph (<i>b</i>), which was inserted I may mention in another place in the course of discussion, a design to break up the grass lands in Ireland. What is said is that these large grass farms are not appropriate subjects for very large advances of public money; and that is quite another matter. I think, speaking generally and apart from the particular question of the actual industry, speaking purely for the moment in the abstract, everybody would agree that a system partly consisting of grazing or dairy farming is probably from the general economic point of view of the well-being of the country superior to the grazing industry pure and simple&#x2014;and for the reason that one employs labour and the other does not. That is an argument which, taking it in the abstract, must appeal to noble Lords opposite as much as to ourselves. But, say noble Lords, this restriction will cause the break up of grass lands. I confess I do not follow that. All it says is that an advance must be limited, but it does not in the least prevent the comparatively wealthy class of people who as a rule are concerned in these farms, from finding the rest of the money and acquiring them. We say that advances of public money shall be so limited, but it does not prevent a person who desires to acquire large grazing farms from raising the money in some other way, and supposing he is reasonably supplied with capital he ought to have no difficulty in doing it. We do desire, in the circumstances of Ireland, and bearing in mind the condition of the congested districts on the one hand and the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0421"/>
<col>829</col>
great pasture districts on the other, to encourage an increase of tillage farming. I quite admit that it cannot be done everywhere. The cases mentioned by he noble Lord opposite, Lord Ashtown, I have no doubt are perfectly in point. Farms which are composed of rocky pastures clearly cannot be broken up for tilling, but the argument used by the noble Lord, Lord Ardilaun, struck me as a strange one when he said it is impossible in certain neighbourhoods to turn any grass land into tillage because there are no people to till it. Surely that is an epitome of the whole Irish question, that you have got half your population crowded and pressed up against your sea board, and you have other parts of Ireland which are practically empty of population. This is part of a scheme to try and increase the population in those parts of Ireland which are barren of inhabitants. We attach importance to the clause as it stands, and I fear, therefore, we must resist the Amendment to the point of dividing if noble Lords opposite desire to go into the Lobby.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02461">Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02462"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> decided to leave over until Report the subsequent Amendments in his name on the Paper to this clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02463"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to add a new subsection to the clause. The noble Lord said that this Amendment was non-contentious and was a corollary to Section 6 which he had succeeded in getting inserted in the Act of 1885. He would give an instance of the working of that section in Ireland. Where
<col>832</col>
the price of a holding and the amount which the Land Commission could advance, apparently now &#x00A3;5,000, were agreed upon, the balance of the purchase money could be made up by arrangement between the owner and the purchaser by a mortgage with any other person. But that mortgage was puisne to the advance made by the Land Commission; it in no way affected the taxpayer or the money given by the Treasury to the Land Commission, but was a transaction between the purchaser and the vendor. It had been found of great advantage, and had been to a certain extent utilised wherever large farms had
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0423"/>
<col>833</col>
to pass from the hands of the owners to the occupiers. The proposal which he made now would not interfere with the annuity which would be paid to the Land Commission. There were practically two sums to be considered&#x2014;the sum due to the Land Commission on which there was an annuity and a sinking fund, and the mortgage to which he had referred, which was generally at about three and a-half per cent. The Land Commission collected the annuity and the sinking fund, and the mortgagee naturally collected his three and a-half per cent. He now proposed that the annuity and the sinking fund should go on exactly as heretofore, but as that sinking fluid was paid off to the Land Commission there naturally arose a greater security for the Land Commission's advance, and he proposed that the mortgagor and the mortgagee might agree to ask the Land Commission to advance an equivalent of what had been paid off under the sinking fund Supposing the sinking fund had been reduced by, say, &#x00A3;500, and the mortgage was for &#x00A3;1,000. The Land Commission would advance the &#x00A3;500 to the person whose mortgage was held, but the Land Commission's security had been increased by the fact of the sinking fund having been paid off, and that fund would be collected again by the Land Commission as the payments became due. The result would be where a large farm had been sold under this system that by degrees, as the sixty-eight and a-half years elapsed, the sinking fund would be paid off and also the interest due to the Land Commission, and at the same time the mortgage <i>pari passu</i> would disappear from the farm. So that at the end of the sixty-eight and a-half years the man would have bought his farm. By this means they would be creating, as he was anxious to see created in Ireland, a class of strong yeomen freehold farmers, who were very necessary in that country. Such an arrangement could be made, say, at intervals of ten or fifteen years. It would have the effect of placing a valuable class of men in residence on their own freeholds in Ireland, and he hoped that His Majesty's Government would concede this small point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02464">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 8, line 42, after the word 'sanctioned,' to insert the following new subsection&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>'(2) Where the price of a holding as agreed upon exceeds the amount for which an advance may

<li>(<i>d</i>) Any such further advance, together with all sums unpaid in respect of the original advance shall be repaid by the purchaser and charged upon the holding in like priority on the like terms and in like manner and by a like annuity as the original advance.'

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02465"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend Lord Castletown has explained clearly the intended effect of this Amendment, but I am not sure that he has stated all the possibilities that might arise under the suggestion made. His paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides that when a sale takes place, the difference between the amount advanced and the agreed upon price might be secured to the vendor by a mortgage&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02466"><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member><membercontribution>: That already exists in Section 6 of the Act of 1885.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02467"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is quite true, but I think the noble Lord will see that there must be a great number of cases in which that transaction is not possible, because when an encumberance exists on an estate, it is necessary for a further mortgage to take the form of cash in order to clear off the existing encumberance. Therefore this paragraph could only apply in the case of an absolutely unencumbered estate, unless it was possible to find the money elsewhere, in which case the transaction would not be worth doing. It seems to me a remarkable paragraph, and the Amendment goes considerably further than I gathered from the speech of the noble Lord. The result would be that where the purchase money was partly advanced and partly secured by a mortgage, the part secured by the mortgage would be provided ultimately by the Land Commission as if it were the entire purchase money.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0424"/>
<col>835</col>
That would take place, as I gather, under the noble Lord's Amendment. Take a case of this kind. Suppose that the largest sum which could be paid within the zones was &#x00A3;300, the vendor might sell the holding for &#x00A3;1,000, of which &#x00A3;500 would be advanced by the Land Commission, and &#x00A3;500 would remain upon mortgage. Well, the Land Commission would apparently advance the full amount, although the purchase price was double the limit. Would not the result be in effect to abolish all limits on the amounts which the Land Commission could advance to a purchaser? Take, for instance, a case of this kind. Supposing it was a case of an advance of &#x00A3;10,000. The Land Commission would advance &#x00A3;5,000, which is the maximum they are able to advance, and the remaining &#x00A3;5,000 takes the form of a mortgage. If you look at paragraph (<i>c</i>)of the Amendment, you will see that as soon as the sinking fund had accumulated to &#x00A3;500, the effect would be that a fresh advance of &#x00A3;500 would be made by the Land Commission, and so on until the whole &#x00A3;5,000 of the mortgage had been advanced by the Land Commission. The noble Lord has not provided for the two debts being paid off at the same time. If the Amendment is passed, there is nothing in it to secure an annuity being paid off at the end of the sixty-eight and a-half years; it might be extended to the remote date of 2046. But I am afraid in any case it would not he possible, even though the amounts had to be paid off concurrently, because it would clearly involve increased advances from the Land Commission in respect of the mortgages, supposing a number of these transactions take place. The Government cannot, therefore, see their way to accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02468"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member> thought the noble Earl would find that the two annuities would practically die out together, because the sinking fund worked out on practically the same lines. As regarded the effect, there was no doubt the noble Earl was correct. An advance of the full sum would eventually be made by the Estates Commissioners, but his point was that they were not asked to make these advances on a mortgage until such time as the sinking fund had reached the sum which they were asked to advance, and every year the security of the Land Commission was increasing in value. He agreed that it was possibly a complicated
<col>836</col>
scheme, and one that the Estates Commissioners might not like to carry out owing to its complexity. He would not press his Amendment, but he would ask whether paragraph (<i>a</i>) might not be agreed to, because that was merely carrying out Section 6 of the Act of 1885. Under this Bill, supposing men chose to come to such an agreement, could they take advantage of that section?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02469"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Speaking off-hand, I think they can. But I will look into the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02470"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member><membercontribution>: I will withdraw the Amendment now, and ask the noble Earl to allow me to bring it up on Report if I find we are able to agree on some provision of this nature.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02476"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> moved to substitute September 15, 1909, for the date mentioned in the clause. He recalled that the proposal which he now submitted was made in the other House by the Chief Secretary for Ireland, and that, on opposition being offered to it, the right hon gentleman hurriedly abandoned his own Amendment and voted against it, at the same time saying that he was convinced by the arguments brought against it and making several allusions to his conscience. Unless the Amendment were accepted great injustice and inconvenience would be caused. If it were possible that, while legislation was pending, fictitious tenancies could be manufactured there would be great objection; but the law provided that a tenant must be a real and <i>bona fide</i> tenant, and the Court of Appeal in Ireland had held that a tenancy created merely for the purpose of sale was not a <i>bona fide</i> tenancy. He could not see the reason or the justice of the provision. Possibly the noble Earl would give them those reasons which had had the result of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0425"/>
<col>837</col>
routing so precipitately the Chief Secretary in the House of Commons; but if the noble Earl could not give them those reasons he would press his Amendment, as he thought it was only just and fair that men who agreed with their tenants during this interval should have the opportunity of the sales afforded under this Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02478"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord alluded to what happened in another place with reference to this Amendment as to which there was undoubtedly no little confusion and misunderstanding on both sides.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02480"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think there was a degree of misunderstanding. What happened was that Mr. Long asked the Chief Secretary to place this Amendment and another Amendment on the Paper on the ground that they were accepted by both landlord and tenant and were of a non-controversial character, and he asked the Chief Secretary to put them down accordingly. The Chief Secretary accepted that statement and moved to re-commit the Bill which was necessary for the purpose with a view of bringing them forward, but to his no little surprise the Motion for the re-committal of the Bill was bitterly opposed by the friends of noble Lords opposite in another place, and a great deal of time was spent in discussing that Motion. The Chief Secretary cleared explained his position. He said he had not looked at the proposed Amendments so closely as he might have done had he been less pressed, and that he had considered that they were of a non-controversial character. It was then stated that the very thing that had happened was that which, as the noble and learned Lord had just said, clearly ought not to have happened&#x2014;namely, that there had been a certain number of cases where tenancies had been created in anticipation of this particular legislation. My right hon. friend was therefore unable to vote for the Amendment, although he had himself put it down.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02481"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> pointed out that the Chief Secretary voted against his own Amendment.</p>

If the Amendment on the Paper were carried the effect would be that there would be some substantial reduction in the amount of untenanted land available. The noble and learned Lord said&#x2014;as, of course, we should naturally expect him to say, and we quite agree with him&#x2014;that where it was a question of creating what could be described as bogus tenancies in anticipation of the passing of the Act that was a practice which ought to be checked, if possible by legislation. As a matter of fact, in Section 53 of the Act of 1903 a parallel provision, I do not say an identical one, was included. That section provided a very distinct limitation, and it was also decidedly of an <i>ex post facto</i> character.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02485"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LANGFORD</member> could not help thinking that this was another of the many phases of the Bill at the bottom of all of which was the fact that it had been determined to secure all untenanted land at somebody's expense in order to fulfil the obligations which the Government had laid themselves under to the landless men in Ireland.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02486"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said that the noble Earl the Leader of the House had told them that the Chief Secretary was given to understand that the Amendments which Mr. Long desired to see proposed would be acceptable to both landlords and tenants. He could not speak for their representatives in the House of Commons, but in their Lordships' House they had no doubt from correspondence, with which they were almost deluged, that the clause was extremely unpopular with a large number of tenants in Ireland. The clause, if it remained as drafted, was going to be of a much more far-reaching character than His Majesty's Government realised. What was the clause going to cut out of land purchase? First of all it was going to cut out all tenancies which had been created since the 1st of January, 1908. He did not think that would be disputed. He was entirely with the Government in saying that where bogus tenancies had been created they certainly should be cut out, but the clause was going to cut out all tenancies whether bogus or not. There was absolutely, as he read the Bill, no relief whatever for the genuine tenancy that had been created since, and that tenant was inevitably going to be cut out of the Bill without any reason being given to him. Secondly, the clause was going to cut out every tenancy in Ireland which had been altered by the landlord since the 1st January, 1908. If a landlord altered a boundary, or slightly increased or decreased a holding with the tenant's consent, that action amounted to the creation of a new tenancy and that tenancy would be cut out of the hope of purchase by the operation of the clause. Thirdly, there was a far-reaching condition of affairs underlying the clause as it then was in the Bill. Supposing a landlord had to evict a tenant for non-payment of rent&#x2014;which involved a very complicated procedure nowadays, althought it did happen sometimes but was a thing a landlord was very loth to do for reasons which it was unnecessary to go into&#x2014;the land from which that tenant was evicted was by the clause for ever cut out of the Purchase Acts. It seemed to him that the clause, therefore, should be amended, or, better still, struck out of the Bill altogether.</p>

It was most unjust that there should be any limit imposed. He could not see any reason why, as long as a man's property remained to him, he should not dispose of it as he thought right, provided it was not done with any corrupt motive. It appeared to him to be a gross injustice that a man who had become a tenant in the belief that he would be in the same position as his neighbour, who, perhaps, might only have held his tenancy six months before him, should be deprived of the power of purchasing by the retrospective effect of the clause. One might easily conceive cases where a landlord who was about to sell his property and, as he feared many would, leave the country altogether, might let a vacant farm to his former steward or other dependent, or divide it among existing tenants, but those new tenancies would be invalid. The old tenant would have power to obtain an advance in respect of his old holding, but not in respect of the new holding he had joined on to it. That seemed to him a gross injustice, and he thought the only course was to reject the clause.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02502"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member>, in moving to leave out paragraph (<i>b</i>), said his Amendment opened up a very serious question. Without desiring to make any imputation against His Majesty's Government, but merely judging from the letter of the Bill, he said, with confidence, that if the Government had desired to divide the unoccupied lands of Ireland among the landless men and thereby to perpetuate the miseries of congestion among those unfortunates who lived in the West of Ireland upon the bog lands and wind-swept mountain sides of the Atlantic seaboard, they could not have chosen a form of words more calculated to effect that object. To divide the grass lands of Ireland among the landless men, who, unfortunately, had been lawless as well as landless, and perpetuate and stereotype congestion was, in his judgment, a sin against the progress and prosperity of Ireland as well as against common humanity. There were far too many holdings in Ireland already. There were only 29,000 more holdings in England, Scotland, and Wales than in Ireland, the figures for Ireland being 490,000 and for England, Scotland, and Wales 519,000. To raise the uneconomic holdings up to the economic value of &#x00A3;10 each, as suggested by the Bill, would require land valued at &#x00A3;1,490,000 per annum, whereas there was not available in the whole of Ireland, excluding mountains and bogs, land valued at more than &#x00A3;620,000, which left a deficit, excluding landlords' domains, of &#x00A3;870,000 per annum, and including landlords' domains there was a deficit of land valued at half a million.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0428"/>
<col>843</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02503">In the different counties which would form the new congested districts the land required to raise the economic holdings to &#x00A3;10 value was land valued at &#x00A3;718,000 per annum, and all that was available was &#x00A3;184,000. In Roscommon there was not half enough; in Donegal and in Leitrim there was not a fourteenth part. The Dudley Commission came to the conclusion that if congestion was to be relieved in the present districts 50,000 families would require to be relieved and the amount necessary to relieve them would be land valued at &#x00A3;350,000 a year, while in the larger districts they calculated that there were at least 80,000 persons to be relieved who would require land valued at &#x00A3;450,000 a year. So that really they wanted land valued at half a million per annum in order to raise the holdings to the economic value of &#x00A3;10. There was not one half available, and without relief the congests must either emigrate, migrate, or stagnate. He was entirely in accord with the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, that the local man should be relieved in preference to the foreign congest. Under the clause a landless man's son or any number of his sons were eligible to each have an advance made for the purpose of buying land instead of their resorting to some other industry. It was perfectly impossible because the land was not there, and as Lord MacDonnell had very properly said they would be driven to make a selection between the landless men and the congests. The Government preferred the landless men. The plain operation of the lause was that the landless men were to be favoured at the expense of the congests, and he would support any clause which enacted that not one acre of land should be sold to any landless man until the wants of the local small holders had been met.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02504">Another consideration left out of sight was the conduct of the landless men and the methods they had resorted to, and so sure as they rewarded turbulence and crime in the way suggested so sure they could never have permanent settlement and peace in Ireland. The Bill appeared to him to be an attempt to pacify those who had put forward claims in a way which was but too well known. He did not exclude them altogether, because after all the legitimate claims had been satisfied the landless men might possibly be let in, with the essential proviso that no advance should be made to more than one son of the same farmer to enable him to purchase land.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02506"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will see that our paragraph (<i>b</i>) proposes that in the case of estates outside the congested districts&#x2014;Clause 17 only applies outside the congested districts&#x2014;a parcel of land may be given to a person being the son of a tenant or proprietor of a holding on or in the neighbourhood of the estate not exceeding &#x00A3;30 in rateable value. It is important to notice, in the first place, that as regards one class of person we impose a limitation which is not imposed by the Act of 1903. Under that Act the son of any tenant on the estate could obtain land, no matter how large his holding. Under this Bill we propose to limit that to those who have a holding of not exceeding &#x00A3;30 of rateable value, and so far we are carrying out the policy of the noble and learned Lord, because we are diminishing&#x2014;perhaps considerably diminishing&#x2014;the number of landless men who might apply for these farms. On the other hand we admit that the inclusion of the words "or in the neighbourhood" undoubtedly has the effect of increasing the possible number of those who may be included, and I suppose it is the insertion of those words which has led the noble and learned Lord to desire the deletion of the paragraph. But once an estate is sold it is not quite easy to draw any logical distinction between the son of a proprietor of a farm on the estate and the son of a proprietor of a farm in the immediate neighbourhood. So long as the estate remains in one hand and all the circumstances which surround an estate under one landlord are present, it is natural enough to limit the distribution of holdings to the sons of tenants on the estate, just as on so many of your Lordships' estates preference is given to the promising son of a good tenant. But the moment the estate is to be sold and the tenants themselves are to become the proprietors, that distinction seems to me, in logic at any rate, to disappear a very great extent.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord entered, as indeed he was bound to do, on the whole question of landless men, and he said that the policy of the Bill as he read it was to divide up all the available untenanted land in Ireland among the landless men. This is a problem of extreme difficulty, and if for once the Government could be favoured with a little assistance from noble Lords opposite
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0429"/>
<col>845</col>
instead of mere denunciation&#x2014;which is what we always get&#x2014;it would be of more practical advantage in this particular instance. I have stated the problem before, and it seems to be necessary to state it again. We are accused of desiring to cut the whole of this land up among landless men&#x2014;that is to say, the sons of farmers; but even our total lack of capacity and foresight&#x2014;which I suppose noble Lords credit us with&#x2014;hardly runs as far as that. It is obvious, of course, that such a remedy would not only ultimately be futile but would prove to be futile almost immediately. There are a certain number of farmers' sons, landless men, who are asking for land at this moment, and there are others growing up who will become men in a very few years time and who will also demand land; and, if you look a little further, the landless man will not remain a wifeless man or a childless man and in turn his children will grow up, and if every landless man is to be provided with land the problem will be an endless one until you have brought down the whole of the land of Ireland to plots no bigger than this Table in front of us. Therefore, my Lords, to say that our policy is to divide up the available untenanted land of Ireland among persons of this kind is really not a fair charge. But what is the position? We are told, on the other hand, that this land is required for those who live in the congested districts and in some cases may have to be migrated from them. My noble friend behind me goes so far as to say that they, and they only, should have a slice of this land under any circumstances. The noble and learned Lord did not go quite so far as that. He admits a certain number of landless men.</membercontribution></p>

If the clause is amended as desired by the noble and learned Lord, a certain number of those who are described as landless men would get holdings after the immediate requirements of the neighbourhood had been satisfied. The problem is this. This land hunger on the part of the landless men does exist. We need not inquire again how it has arisen. We have been accused of not having dealt sternly enough with what, after all, was only its manifestation and cannot be considered its
<col>846</col>
Cause&#x2014;namely, cattle-driving. But even assuming that we could have put down cattle-driving by means of the Crimes Act or by more severe measures still</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02510"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Or by ordinary law, as the noble Marquess suggests; you cannot prevent these people from desiring to possess their own farms; you cannot put them in prison for having that desire, and even supposing noble Lords opposite were administering Ireland and were to imprison the cattle-drivers and reduce them to a full degree of physical terror, you would still have them keenly desiring land. Whatever may have been the methods adopted to express that desire and the possible provocation given by the breaking of the law, you cannot cure them of their land hunger, and once you have dumped your congests down by the dozen in these districts what is the life of those congests likely to be? An argument which has been continually pressed upon us during the course of this debate is that you dare not move the congests. We have pointed out before that in our view the only hope of reaching a solution of this difficult question is, while bearing in mind that the first and foremost use to which this untenanted land must and ought to be put is the relief of congestion, at the same time to bear in mind that there may be some cases&#x2014;the noble and learned Lord himself admits it&#x2014;where in order to secure the general acceptance of this system of migration from the congested districts you must let some of these landless men into possession of farms.<lb/>
I quite admit it would be infinitely more convenient if the desire of the landless man had never come into being at all. If he were content to go off to America it might in some respects be more convenient, but I am sure we do not want the people to leave Ireland so long as they can find any useful employment there. But the fact remaining as it does, is it possible, merely by saying that you will not admit any landless man or only the most limited class of these landless men into the possession of farms, to establish a state of things by which you will be able to place people from the congested districts on the land? That is the point on which we ask your Lordships' assistance. No speaker has
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0430"/>
<col>847</col>
yet, so far as I am aware, when we have been discussing this matter on previous occasions ever faced that problem. What are you going to do? If you want to put congests on a particular piece of land and you know that public opinion in the neighbourhood is hostile to their arrival, are you going to leave that unprovided for, or are you in some degree going to placate public opinion by dividing up the land, say, in the proportion of three-fourths for congests and one-fourth for the sons of tenants in the neighbourhood? We do not say that the problem is soluble on those lines, but we think they go some way towards a solution. We therefore oppose the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord in this particular case because we think it limits too closely the class of men to whom in certain circumstances it may be desirable to give a farm.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02511"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said he had listened with the greatest interest to the noble Earl opposite, but he really could not make out from his speech whether he held a brief for the congests or for the landless men, because he had told them that in order to deal with the congests they must provide a certain amount of land for landless men. They all knew that land hunger existed amongst landless men, but land hunger existed everywhere. He himself liked good land like everybody else; it was a good thing to have, but he did not go and drive his neighbour's cattle in order to force the authorities to consider his case. Therefore he thought that what the noble Earl had said amounted to a sort of bribe to the landless men to keep quiet in order to enable the congests to be "planted" in other parts of Ireland. He did not agree with that policy. Under the clause the Land Commission could sell a parcel of land to any tenant or proprietor of a holding not exceeding &#x00A3;10 in rateable value not necessarily on the same estate at all, and to the sons of tenants in the neighbourhood of the estate, to persons who had surrendered their holdings for the purpose of relieving congestion, to evicted tenants, and to any person to whom the Land Commission thought that an advance ought to be made.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02512"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the question before the Committee seemed to him on that clause to have nothing to do with the relief of congestion. The clause dealt with cases of the sale of
<col>848</col>
an estate to the Land Commission and advances under the Land Purchases Acts. He was glad to find with regard to the views he had already ventured to express to their Lordships, that he had such a powerful advocate as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson; and he trusted when the matter was more fully discussed under Clause 55, as it would be, he would have his support in placing before the Committee the views which he in common with all the members of the Dudley Commission held in regard to the necessity of ear-marking untenanted land in the province of Connaught for the relief of congestion. As the noble and learned Lord had said, it was absolutely a part of their programme that congestion in the neighbourhood of the land to be bought should be relieved first of all, and that the land which remained over after the relief of local congestion should be applied to the relief of congestion within the scheduled areas. In the relief of local congestion by enlarging the holdings of uneconomic tenancies in the neighbourhood of the grass lands to be bought they would be largely relieving the landless men they would be relieving the fathers of these men who at all events during the last year had in a manner and by a method which he for one could not too strongly condemn asserted their desire to get possession of the land which they had been longing for for ages. The question raised on that particular clause had nothing to do with the relief of congestion, nor indeed with the land in the neighbourhood of the congested districts, though the words, of course, were very wide.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02513">It was understood that in the Bill there was a distinction drawn between the area in which the Congested Districts Board were to operate and the rest of Ireland which was to be under the jurisdiction of the Estates Commissioners, and he ventured to think that the noble and learned Lord had somewhat failed to bring to notice the distinction which existed between the Act of 1903 and the Bill before the Committee. Under the Act of 1903 land could be given to the son of a tenant irrespective of the extent of land the father possessed, whereas in the Bill land was to be given to the son of a tenant whose holding did not exceed &#x00A3;30 in rateable value. That was much more restricted than the existing law, but there was an extension under the Bill beyond the existing law&#x2014;namely, that land might
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0431"/>
<col>849</col>
be given to the son of a tenant in the neighbourhood. That, no doubt, did enlarge the sphere from which tenants' sons might be brought in, but the restriction of &#x00A3;30 would be a very powerful and effective limit on the class of people whose sons were eligible. It was within the knowledge of noble Lords that in the West of Ireland on many occasions threatenings of agrarian trouble had been removed by the mediation of the Estates Commissioners. In one case which he called to mind at the moment, the Dunsandle case, an agreement was come to through the intervention of the Estates Commissioners which was a pattern and example to the West of Ireland, but that agreement could not possibly have been arrived at unless the sons of the more important farmers in the neighbourhood were allowed to obtain certain portions of the grass lands, which the landlord gave up for the purpose. The matter was carried through, farms were blocked out and the young men set to work on them with a degree of industry and intelligence which was perfectly astonishing to any one who observed the condition of their neighbours; and if their Lordships set their faces against such agreements being come to between landlords and tenants and their sons&#x2014;they had been called landless men, but he called them the sons of respectable tenants and yeoman farmers&#x2014;they would be doing a great deal to prevent that peaceful settlement of the question which they all so much desired.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02514">He was disposed to hope, after the explanation which had been given, that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, would see some reason to mitigate his hostility to paragraph (<i>b</i>). With regard to the Amendment standing in his name to insert a provision giving the Estates Commissioners liberty to sell mansions, demesne lands, pleasure grounds, and other non-agricultural lands, he ventured to think that without some such provision they would not stop or quench the lust for land by asking applicants to be satisfied with all outside the demesne wall. As long as they held out to them any possibility of their breaking down the wall and having the gardens and the lawns and the pleasure grounds divided among them, they would not be satisfied until that was done. A definite prohibition was necessary. In all this legislation it was one of their objects to preserve as far as possible the gentry in their own homes,
<col>850</col>
and where they desired to leave their homes to substitute for them a resident gentry who were anxious to buy the homes which the former had left. It would be a great pity if they were to expose those demesnes to partition amongst the sons of farmers in the neighbourhood who would not be able to turn them to the good use which they might be turned to if sold by the Estates Commissioners in their present condition. He would, therefore, ask the adherence of their Lordships to the subsequent Amendment in his name rather than to the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02515"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said he had placed an Amendment down to delete Clause 17 because he desired to see the ground cleared for the primary object of their Land Acts, the relief of congestion. If congestion was to be relieved, the congest must have the prior claim, and therefore the claims of the landless men must be put into the background. It had been often said that Section 2 of the Act of 1903 was the origin of the claim of the landless men, but that section was only introduced to deal with a case that might occur&#x2014;namely, where a congested estate was bought which contained a grass farm. To assume, for argument's sake, that the grass farm amounted to 400 acres, 200 acres of that grass farm might be sufficient to deal with all the congested tenants on the estate; another 100 acres might be used up in dealing with evicted tenants from the estate, and then they had a surplus of 100 acres in the hands of the State. Were they to hold that 100 acres as landlords for ever, or were they to put it up to auction? Neither of these courses seemed advisable to the Government of the day, and they said "We will use what is over for the sons of the tenants on the estate." That was the only way in which the landless man came into the deal at all. The noble Earl who led the House stated that the situation had become very acute owing to the fact that the claims of the landless men as against the congests had become the burning question of the hour. He admitted it was a very critical situation but it was one, if he might say so, which had been fostered by His Majesty's Government instead of the agitation being checked by them. When they started the Congested Districts Board and migration things worked quietly and smoothly, but for want of firmness in dealing with the situation the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0432"/>
<col>851</col>
difficulties of their work in the relief of congestion became greater and greater. The noble Earl advocated a policy of placating local feeling by giving way to agitation. He believed that the Irishman was one of the wisest and shrewdest of His Majesty's subjects, and that was why he wanted to eliminate once for all the idea of the landless man as against the congest. The Irishman being a shrewd man would quickly realise if firmness was used that the congest was intended to have the prior claim, and the agitation would cease. That was the only alternative he could suggest&#x2014;to tell the landless man that the congest was to have the prior claim, and that he was only to come in as a last resource if there was land available. They on the Congested Districts Board had definitely proved that if they were going to thoroughly relieve congestion there would be no surplus land for the landless man, and if they let the landless man know that he believed they would be able to proceed with their work of migration undisturbed. He did not believe in placating agitation in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02516"><member>LORD INCHIQUIN</member> said he had a sketch map of County Clare, in which county there was no congestion at all, showing the districts where cattle-driving had taken place, and also showing twenty-one mansions with regard to every one of which agitation in some form or another had taken place to have those mansions and demesnes sold to landless men only. There had been boycotting, shooting, burning, and every conceivable form of intimidation used by these landless men who were trying to turn owners out of the country and seize their land. Another reason why landless men were very keen to get land was that their fathers did not have to pay anything towards it, and naturally they would go on agitating if His Majesty's Government allowed them, to think they were going to get it. He would like to see a provision in the Bill that the landless men were not to get a penny until the claims of the congests had been satisfied, and even then only the crumbs that fell from the congests' table.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02517"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: The last two speeches we have listened to were very instructive and very suggestive. Let me just say this, first of all, with regard to cattle-driving. I think the offence is an abominable one,
<col>852</col>
and I should be very glad indeed to see the offenders properly punished. The noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, is pleased to think that it is the fault of His Majesty's Government that these men have not been punished. I do not share that opinion, but if I were to embark on that controversy, which has been the subject of so much debate in this House, I am afraid, if your Lordships were good enough to listen to me, that you would forget all about the problem we are now discussing, which is a very serious and very real one. My noble friend the Leader of the House asked your Lordships for some assistance in the solution of it. Let me take the case put by the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury. He is a member of the Congested Districts Board. He wants to relieve congestion and proposes to migrate, I do not care how many, but say 100, congests to a particular district which is not their own, and the noble Earl proposes to say that the landless men in that locality are to have nothing until the congests are all satisfied, and as the noble Lord, Lord Inchiquin, said, even then they were only to have the crumbs that fell from the congests' table. Let us understand definitely whether I have correctly stated it. [The EARL OF SHAFTESBURY and LORD INCHIQUIN intimated their assent.] Then there is no doubt about it; that is the policy they want to adopt throughout Ireland. I ask your Lordships to take the districts in England and Scotland with which you are familiar and to suppose that a number of people were migrated into those districts from the East-end of London, for example, and that the people in the locality&#x2014;Yorkshire, Berkshire, Hampshire, or wherever it may be&#x2014;were told, "You are to get nothing until all these people from the East-end of London are satisfied in regard to their wish for land, and even then only the crumbs that fall from their table." There would be, I venture to think, a good deal of feeling even in quiet England. How do noble Lords propose to deal with that in Ireland? We were told yesterday that it was impracticable to migrate strangers without taking into consideration the feelings of the locality.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02518"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said that that had become so now, but he did not think it was the case originally.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02519"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Do not let us be diverted to the past by the suggestion
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0433"/>
<col>853</col>
of the noble Earl, or into considering whether it would or would not have become a problem at all but for the fault of the Government. I am trying to deal with the problem at the present moment, to reason it out and to ask your Lordships to consider it frankly and fully and not to enter into recrimination, as I see no need for mixing up with this discussion the consideration of other irrelevant topics. We have heard the policies suggested by the noble Lords. I am not sure whether it is the policy of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02520"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that he should be very glad to support that policy, but it was not quite his Amendment. His Amendment left room for the landless men after securing due priority to the claims of the others.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02521"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The policy of the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, is the Rhadamanthine one, "I will summon the police, I will send the necessary number of military, but I will not give anything to the people of the locality, and I will cram into their midst as many congests from other districts as I think fit." That my Lords, is one of the alternative policies which has been suggested. I ask, not for the purpose of Parliamentary dialectics, is that the policy that noble Lords opposite, who may become responsible for the government of Ireland, intend to pursue? The only other policy, and the one we propose, is to try if it can be done to effect an accommodation between those people who are brought into a locality and the people of the locality themselves. That is our policy, and it has been denounced as being timid and as giving way to looting, lawlessness, intimidation, and so forth, call it whatever you please. I think I am right in saying there are only two policies; there is no third. The first seems to me to be a very grim and formidable one, and I do think myself that noble Lords are not entitled to assume, as has been done by some throughout this discussion, that all landless men are criminals and in sympathy with crime. Some of them, no doubt, are, but you assume they are all so, and you would treat them in this rigorous manner and thrust in among them congests from other districts and give them only the crumbs that are left. The noble Earl himself told us that there would not be land enough in Ireland for
<col>854</col>
more than the congests&#x2014;I think he said there would not be enough even for them. My Lords, such a solution coming from those who may become responsible for the good administration of government in Ireland does not commend itself at least to me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02522"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he had not heard the noble and learned Lord who had just sat down do other than repeat the arguments used in previous stages of the Bill, and he had not seen any desire on the part of His Majesty's Government to meet any of the objections which were felt so strongly on his side of the House. He admitted that the topic of the landless men was one which could not now be put aside, but it was more than human nature to expect them to forget that landless men came into existence under the government of Mr. Birrell, and that what could have been checked when it first arose must now be yielded to by an absolute surrender and collapse of government. He was afraid that the noble and learned Lord's argument amounted to this, that the landless men had to be kept quiet by a process which he regarded as concession, but which other people might regard as surrender and bribery. If that policy was to he adopted it should be done in the most meagre and prudent way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02523">The Dudley Commission, called into existence to deal with the problem of congestion which was the great topic before the House, said that the only way to deal adequately with that question was to keep their eyes steadily fixed on the congests and put the landless men sternly and firmly on one side, until the congests had been dealt with. The Bill entirely put that aside, and it was very strange that the Government should have ignored the carefully reasoned and thought out recommendations of that Commission. They had been left entirely in the dark as to what the Government intended to do with the various Amendments put down to the Bill, everyone of which in his view was entitled to full and favourable consideration, and he thought when the first Amendment on the subject was moved they ought to have had some intimation from the noble Earl in charge of the Bill of what his general view of the Amendments put down was, and how far His Majesty's Government were Prepared to make concessions in reference to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0434"/>
<col>855</col>
them, but that had not been the line taken by the noble Earl. He agreed with every syllable the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, had said. He also held a strong view with reference to paragraph (<i>e</i>). He thought as it stood it was unarguable, it was so bad. He agreed with the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, who was entitled to speak with authority on the question from having been on the Congested Districts Board and from his own high character. It would have been wiser, in his opinion, to have let Section 2 of the Act of 1903 stand. That section was intended to meet a difficulty cognate to that which now pressed on the Government. Although he did not say it would have solved it, he thought it would have been a more reasonable way of approaching the question than by obliterating the section and putting one in its place so wide that he regarded it as extravagant and unacceptable. Reciprocity was essential in all these matters; the Government had heard the objections and abundant arguments on the point and they knew they must be met not only by argument but by some concession. But that had not been suggested. That was not a fair way to meet a Bill like the one before them, bristling with so many provocative topics; he thought there might have been a little more frankness shown as to what was in the mind of the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02524"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, had asked him what policy he would pursue. He did not shrink from answering that question. He would first raise the farms of what he called local congests to &#x00A3;10 in value; he would then reserve land to deal with the foreign congests; he would tell the landless men that those congests must have priority and that the struggles of the landless men were as hopeless as they were selfish, and he would endeavour to make the landless man behave himself by a vigorous administration of the law and not by a promise of reward. In his first Amendment he did not at all make it impossible to give land to landless men provided the priority of local persons with small holdings was preserved. After their claims had been adequately met, then, the others could come in. Then, again, only one son of the same farmer should get land. He really thought it monstrous, considering the small quantity of land available to meet the large demand, to give three farms to three sons of the same tenant. That
<col>856</col>
seemed to him to be a wild and reckless sacrifice of the interests of a great many others. He did not attach so much importance to the other part of his proviso that no advance should be made to the son of a tenant of a holding of more than &#x00A3;10 rateable value, but he did adhere to confining it to only one son of the same tenant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02525"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said he was impressed by the arguments of Lord MacDonnell and by what had fallen from the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor. He understood they were now dealing with purchases outside the congested districts. His whole argument rested on that, and he would support any Amendment making it clear that the provisions of the clause did not apply within the congested districts. Within congested districts it seemed to him clear that the claim of the congests should come first, and a stern resistance ought to be presented to anybody who tried to stand in their way. Outside the congested districts also he agreed that the first consideration should be shown for local congests; but he could not go the length of maintaining that, when the local congests had been dealt with, congests from other parts of Ireland should have a prior claim within areas outside the congested districts to the claims of local men. He thought any attempt to force congests indiscriminately upon other parts of the country was bound to lead to trouble, and he really did not see that the arguments which had been addressed to the Committee on that point by the Government had met with any answer at all. It seemed to him that their position was unanswerable, and that any attempt to deal with congests in the way suggested by the noble and learned Lord would lead to the greatest confusion and was essentially unjust. He would most cordially support any proposal which would make it perfectly clear to the landless men that their lawless agitation was a hopeless one, but he did not think that their Lordships' natural and rightful abhorrence of cattle-driving and other forms of illegal violence should lead them entirely to ignore the claims of local men to be considered, when estates were bought outside the congested districts by the Estates Commissioners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02526"><member>LORD ATKENTSON</member> desired to say one word of explanation in the hope of capturing the noble Viscount. If the policy
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0435"/>
<col>857</col>
of the noble Viscount were followed they would never relieve congestion. That was the answer, because all the land available in the congested districts would not go half the way or quarter the way to relieving the congestion, and therefore they must migrate these men. It was a choice between migration or leaving them in their misery, and he preferred migration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02527"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member> said he understood that; but even if the policy of the noble and learned Lord was adopted there would still be a number of people unprovided for, because there was not land enough in any case; and important as it was to relieve congestion he could not for a moment admit that every other consideration with regard to Irish land ought to give way to the relief of congestion. He could not consistently vote against the proposal of the Government when he had just voted against limiting the amount to be advanced to tenants. He had voted against that, because he had been convinced by the argument that it was desirable to keep large tenants on the land and not to have Ireland entirely occupied by small men; and then he heard immediately afterwards from the same quarter that everything ought to be sacrificed to the relief of congestion. He could not reconcile the two positions. His hope for the future of Ireland was based on there being a great variety of holdings there&#x2014;large, medium, and small; and he thought there was considerable danger of injuring land settlement as a whole if they were going to try to import congests into every part of Ireland in preference to the sons of local farmers who might be men of a superior class and really more capable of developing the land than the congests.</p>

The mistake His Majesty's Government seem to me to make is that they sweep away Section 2 of the Act of 1903 and confront us with this extremely elaborate proposal, which I think is interpreted in various ways in different parts of the House.</p>

We think we have taken an infinitely more simple and convenient course by repealing the section in the Act of 1903 and putting, in the form of a new clause, exactly the provisions which we think ought to exist. The objection to legislation by reference which is so often taken in this House is met by our setting out in clear form exactly what our proposals are. It may be desirable to modify those proposals in some respects, but I hope it will not be necessary to undo the proposed repeal of Section 2 of the Act of 1903.</membercontribution></p>

As regards the one son, there, again, I think it is an indication that the noble and learned Lord wants to limit the practice as far as possible. I do not know whether it would operate fairly. It seems a little hard that where a man has one son that that son should have the chance of a farm, whereas his neighbour who has nine or ten sons can only have one of them similarly favoured. Therefore, I do think it creates something of au inequality, particularly in a land of large families like Ireland.

Therefore, the destination of the residuum was left entirely in the hands of the Estates Commissioners without the qualification which, so far as he understood, either his noble friend behind him or Lord MacDonnell intended to move. Of course, if the Lord Chairman ruled that they had passed that point it was impossible to reconsider it at that stage; but he thought their Lordships ought on Report to consider whether both these Amendments, which were equally germane, as he understood, to the decision they arrived at before dinner, ought not to be incorporated in the Bill.</p>

As that paragraph now stood it would be quite possible that the question of the evicted tenant would go on indefinitely. Under the Act of 1903 the intention was that after the date of that Act no person evicted should have the right to reinstatement; but the legal interpretation was that persons evicted after the date of the passing of the Act of 1903 should be entitled to reinstatement in like manner as those evicted before the date of that Act. That was a legal interpretation which, in his mind, completely neutralised the object of the Act of 1903 so far as that point was concerned. Their Lordships' House when adopting the Evicted Tenants Bill rectified that error so far as that Act was concerned. His first Amendment was directed to rectifying the error in this Bill also, so that from the date of the passing of the Bill into an Act no tenant evicted afterwards should have the right to claim the privileges which their Lordships had been pleased to confer upon evicted tenants.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02580">Perhaps he might be allowed to state very briefly what he imagined to be the policy of the Government under this clause; and he would like to be permitted, although he could speak only for himself, to express his appreciation of the policy of the Government in this matter, and satisfaction that in a Bill bristling with so many important matters they had not omitted to deal with a question which he believed would largely affect the welfare of Ireland. Ireland had a great many assets but they were neglected assets, and one which could be most easily remedied, only it would take time, was afforestation. The Department of Agriculture two years ago appointed a Departmental Committee to examine into this question. Their Lordships need not be alarmed, for he was not going to read long extracts from a Blue-book; but there were two or three paragraphs at the end of the Report which demonstrated the urgency and necessity of dealing with this question. One paragraph said&#x2014;
<quote>"Afforestry has in the past been deplorably neglected by the Government of Ireland, and in consequence, while the country is particularly well
<col>868</col>
suited for tree growing, the percentage of land under woods in Ireland is now the lowest of any country save one in Europe; this percentage is too low for the welfare of the country; nevertheless, it is being wastefully diminished at the present time, chiefly under the indirect influence of the Land Purchase Acts, with great loss to the country and imminent, danger to existing Irish wood-working industries."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02581">In these circumstances he thought they owed acknowledgments to the Government for having taken action in the matter. The new subsection which he had ventured to place upon the Paper was in no way in opposition to the policy of the Government. He simply added one further category which he thought might be of advantage. The subsection followed in spirit and almost in letter the two subsections which the Government had placed in the Bill. Here, again, they had a procedure which appeared to be somewhat unnecessarily slow, because they would imagine that anywhere else but in Ireland if an owner wished to sell a particular estate and wished to reserve a certain portion of it for the planting of trees he would sell the whole with the exception of the part he wished to preserve. It was not so in Ireland. In Ireland, under the accumulation of Land Acts, he had to sell the whole of the estate and then under an order of the Land Commission, the landlord might resume that part which in all other countries he would simply have reserved on the sale. He hoped noble Lords on both sides of the House, especially those from Ireland, would agree with him that they owed a debt of gratitude to the Government for undertaking to deal with this question. They had not, of course, undertaken to deal with the whole of the Report to which he had alluded, because that Report recommended, amongst other things, that a large scheme of afforestation should be entered upon in Ireland. In his opinion large schemes of afforestation were somewhat doubtful in their results. They were very costly. Probably the operations with regard to them would be very prolonged, and, on the whole, he thought the Government had been wise in not entering upon the large scheme which the Departmental Committee recommended. He believed he was totally out of order, but perhaps the Lord Chairman would excuse his saying that there was another clause which the Government had inserted in this Bill&#x2014;Clause 34&#x2014;in which they had gone still further in the direction of preventing the

<col>870</col>
Benches approves of Clause 19, and I was also glad to hear him read paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Clause 34, which is a clause we value, and one of the very few which noble Lords have not proposed to omit. As regards the proposed extension by my noble friend, I should like to ask him whether he considers, that this particular Amendment is required, in view of the rather singular procedure needed to carry it out. What my noble friend proposes is that the landlord who sells should acquire part of the holding of the purchasing tenant for the purpose either of planting trees or of preserving them. That, of course, is the reverse operation to everything else that takes place under the Land Acts. In all other oases the tenant acquires from the landlord, but here the landlord has to acquire from the tenant. Well, it is quite possible for him to do that if the tenant agrees. If the tenant agrees after the whole process has taken place, the landlord can buy, with the leave of the Land Commission, a particular portion of the estate. Of course, to us in England it seems a singular thing that a plantation should form part of an agricultural holding, but as we know in Ireland it is the rule. The only case in which the Amendment of the noble Earl would operate is where a tenant was umwilling&#x2014;where he refused to enter into an agreement&#x2014;and, in view of the very complicated procedure that would be necessary, I would like to ask the noble Earl whether he really thinks it worth while to insert a provision of this kind for, the purpose of coercing an unwilling tenant. I think it would be very difficult to purchase back land from a tenant who was unwilling. I do not know what would happen to the plantation in such cases. Where the tenant agrees the matter is quite simple, because after the purchase has taken place the, landlord only has to buy back. In those circumstances we should prefer not to accept the Amendment, because we believe that in the very large number of cases where it could be done it would be covered by subsections (1) and (2), In all other cases where it can usefully be done it can be done by agreement, as I have stated.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02588">It was not a question of the value of the property but the shelter given by small isolated plantations.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02589"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL of MAYO</member> wished to say a word about this subject from the artistic point of view; because in some parts of the county in which he lived estates had been sold and avenues which were picturesque and afforded shelter to travellers and to cattle had been cut down.</p>

With regard to small plantations which his noble friend Lord Clonbrock referred to, he thought there should be some provision in the Bill. He quite saw the difficulties which the noble Earl pointed out. They all knew what Ireland was; the tenant might make objections to these plantations being reserved; but this cutting down of trees had become an absolute scandal in Ireland. Not only they, but all the members of the Nationalist Party who really wished to see the country not denuded of beautiful trees were at one in the matter. They wished to stop it by some means or other, and if the noble Earl in charge of the Bill did not think this subsection effective he hoped the noble Earl would introduce words that would stop the cutting down of trees. He did not think that friction would arise with the tenant as to the reservation of trees. He must be a very disagreeable man who would cause trouble over that. But the fact was, the trees had been cut down and the cattle turned into the plantation, it became a free pasturage for every loose blackguard and scoundrel in the country and his cattle, and their Lordships wished to preserve it from that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02592"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think I may say; without fear of contradiction, that there is no difference between the two sides of the House as to the general policy which should be pursued
<col>872</col>
with regard to this question of the preservation of trees, and I gladly join with my noble friend on the Cross Benches in expressing my obligations to His Majesty's Government for having inserted in this Bill several provisions intended to protect timber of all kinds in Ireland. It is really, to my mind, a tragical thing to see the way in which growing timber, not only in plantations but outside as well, has been ruthlessly cut down and exterminated by tenant purchasers under the Act, and I gladly acknowledge that this Bill already contains provisions to meet that to some extent, but the Amendment moved by my noble friend Earl Cadogan seems to me to touch a point which is not covered by the Bill as it now stands. The particular case which I think he has in view, and which I have also in view, is the case in which comparatively valueless land&#x2014;rough mountain land&#x2014;either with growing timber upon it or capable of being used for the purpose of planting trees, is sold with the rest of the holding to a purchasing tenant. The case that would be met by my noble friend's Amendment would only be where the portion of land in question was quite insignificant in value compared with the value of the whole farm, and what we would like to see would be an arrangement by which, in the case of a sale, the Land Commissioners might at the outset permit the landlord to reserve a portion of the holding, not so great that it would substantially affect the value of the whole farm, in order that the timber upon it might be preserved. I think the wording of the Amendment would require slight alteration, because as it now stands it would be necessary to obtain the agreement of landlord and tenant. In my view it should be left to the Land Commission to decide in a case of that kind whether the reservation was a reasonable one or not. The noble Earl will remember that under the existing Acts there is a power of resumption reserved to the landlord for the good of the estate, or something of that kind&#x2014;I forget what the exact words are. The policy of this Amendment is the same&#x2014;namely, that where a holding of 100 acres, say, is sold, and some little corner of it has got a few trees or is capable of growing a few trees, the landlord should be able to go before the Land Commission and say, "Let me reserve that upon terms which you consider to be absolutely fair and equitable."<lb/>

There was one point to which allusion had not been made. He carefully added at the end of the subsection, "upon such terms as to compensation and otherwise as may be agreed upon." He would like to ask the noble Earl in charge of the Bill whether it would not be possible, under terms embracing compensation, to obtain the consent of the tenant. He thought in many cases that consent could be obtained, but he would be quite willing to add what he gathered the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, desired&#x2014;namely, that the Land Commission should come in instead of the matter being decided by consent between the parties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02594"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I ought to explain that the difficulty as the law stands, and will stand if the noble Earl's Amendment is accepted, is that the entire holding will have been sold to the tenant and the landlord has to buy it back.

He agreed entirely with Earl Cadogan that it was deplorable that timber should be cut down in Ireland. He had had a somewhat painful experience himself. He delivered an annual address in the North of Ireland, and generally took a subject with which he hoped his hearers would sympathise. One year he devoted himself to dealing at considerable length with the great advantage to tenant purchasers of maintaining timber for the reason Lord Clonbrock had given. He pointed out instances where there was no timber and the country was very poor, and he also pointed out some districts
<col>874</col>
where timber Was of great advantage. He flattered himself he had made a great impression upon his hearers. The following year he asked some of his friends what the subject of his address should be, and they said, "On no account touch the question of timber, because the tenant purchasers took advantage of your address to cut down all the timber they had and sell it to the nearest shipyard."

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02602"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved to omit from the second line of subsection (1) the words "under subsection (2) of section one or." He asked their Lordships, in order to understand the proposal, to recall what happened in connection with Clause 14. In connection with that clause he made proposals which were devised to amend it. Clause 14 proposed that inquiry should be made as to the security of the advance
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0444"/>
<col>875</col>
and as to the equity of the price. The first of those points&#x2014;security of the advance&#x2014;had already been disposed of. The question of the equity of the price was raised in the present Amendment. He reminded their Lordships that when the Act of 1903 was under discussion in another place the question of the fixing of rents of judicial tenants was included, in the first draft of the Act, amongst the tenancies that were affected by the zones; but in accordance with an agreement come to the non-judicial tenants were excluded from the zones and were dealt with in a special section&#x2014;namely, Section 5. That section ran&#x2014;
<quote>"In the case of the sale of an estate when an application for an advance to which the provisions of subsection (1) of section one of this Act do not apply is made, the Land Commissioners may, subject to the limitations of the Land Purchase Acts, advance the whole or part of the purchase money if they are satisfied with the security and are of opinion that having regard to all the circumstances of the case the agreed price is equitable."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02603">A controversy took place with regard to the words "the agreed price is equitable." One party to the controversy maintained that the Land Commissioners, in dealing with cases of non judicial rents, were entitled to look behind the contract into the equity of the bargain between the landlord and the tenant. The other party to the controversy held that that sort of an inquiry was precluded by the terms of the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02604">His present proposal was devised with the view of saying that the inquiry of the Estates Commissioners into the contract between the vendor and the tenant should be restricted to the points indicated in the Amendment&#x2014;namely, to determining and ascertaining whether or not the improvements effected in the holding had formed part of the subject-matter of the bargain between the landlord and the tenant. If the improvements were effected by the tenant naturally they were the property of the tenant and ought not to be included in a contract of sale with the landlord. On the other hand, if the improvements were effected by the landlord the landlord was entitled to receive in the price compensation for them. That was the compromise which he had ventured to suggest upon this part of the Bill, namely, that the restrictions in Clause 14 as to the equity of the price&#x2014;that the inquiry into that point should be limited to an inquiry into
<col>876</col>
whether or not the improvements effected in the estate were effected by the landlord or by the tenant. Obviously if they were effected by the tenant they should not form part of the subject-matter of the contract; while, on the other hand, if they were effected by the landlord, equally obviously they ought to form part of the contract.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02606"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I confess it is not quite clear to me, from what my noble friend has said, why he considers it desirable that in all cases where a transaction takes place within the zones the clause should not apply. As I understand, my noble friend thinks that where the transaction has taken place outside the zone the inquiry provided by Clause 20 should be made; that is to say, that the Land Commission should consider whether the agreed price of a holding is equitable having regard to the respective interests of the landlord and tenant in the improvements thereon. But why, in regard to public policy, should there not also be cases within the zone where such an inquiry is necessary? Noble Lords opposite know very well why this clause was inserted. As an instance of what might occur if it was not inserted, a case which was alluded to yesterday&#x2014;the King-Harman case&#x2014;was a case in point. It being understood that the object of these Acts is to sell the landlord's interest to the tenant, it does not seem to be in any way in accordance with public policy that the tenant should be allowed to buy his own improvements under the Act. That is what it really comes to, and as regards the distinction drawn by my noble friend behind me, surely it is possible that where a judicial rent is fixed and a purchase has taken place within the zones, improvements may be made subsequently to the fixing of the judicial rent, and which ought to have the same care on the part of the Land Commissioners as though the instance came under Section 5 of the Act of 1903. In those circumstances, and feeling as we do that the necessity, if not absolutely equal in the two cases, is quite liable to arise where the case is within the zones, we cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02608"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member>, in. moving to leave out Clause 20, said he did not interpose in the discussion on the Amendment to the clause because he was very much of the same opinion as an Irish tenant whom he once heard giving evidence about his holding and who said, "The more you improve it the worse it gets." Of all the grotesque provisions ever introduced into any Bill this was the most grotesque. Subsection (1) of Section 1 of the Act of 1903 provided for a case where the rent was fixed but the terms were not brought within the zones, but Section 5 referred to cases where the rent was fixed and the whole advance was not asked for or where no rent was fixed at all, and inasmuch as a limited owner could sell it was necessary that they should put in some provision which would protect the interest of those in remaindership. Consequently the words as to equity were introduced. He did not know who were the people to whom the noble Earl referred as having regarded "equitable" as "equitable as between vendor and purchaser." A glimmering sense of law would prevent any person falling into that mistake. Accordingly when it was brought up in the King-Harman case before the present Master of the Rolls in Ireland, then Chief Commissioner, he decided, as any sensible human being could only decide, that equitable meant equitable as regarded the persons in remainder. This attempt to get round it was most peculiar, because he did not know whether the clause was intended to say that the equity was to be confined to the cases where the tenant was not paid or compensated for improvements, or whether it was a specific equity that entitled it to be set aside irrespective of other equities. If the authors of the Bill had selected a particular equity on which the contract to purchase could be set aside they had selected a most peculiar one, for of all the knotty questions ever involved in the complicated Irish Land Code the question of improvements was probably the most complicated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02609">As the Bill of 1881 was passing through the House of Commons Mr. Timothy Healy moved what was now a sub-clause that rents should not be fixed upon the improvements of a tenant for which he was paid or otherwise compensated. Then began the question of what was "otherwise compensated." Was permission to enjoy the improvement "compensation"&#x2014;where the tenant held under a tenure that could not be disturbed?
<col>878</col>
Was enjoyment under a tenure that could be disturbed "compensation"? Was the grant of a new lease "compensation"? In 1896 the then Government brought in a Bill which was designed, at all events, to set at rest this question of compensation. They drew up a long and uninviting section to try and lay down what was compensation and what was not. He was sorry to say they were not quite successful, and questions had since arisen. When a landlord and tenant agreed to purchase the land although the tenant was about to go in, if he was defrauded, coerced, cheated, or oppressed in any way, he could immediately ask that his contract should be broken up. But this proposal was meant to apply to cases where the tenant did not ask; cases where, as in the King-Harman case, he did not want to ask. The peculiarity of that case was that the Commissioners said, "We want to know whether we can set aside this contract because the tenant pays too much"; but the tenant, coming into Court, said, "I have not paid too much"; and the argument on behalf of the Estates Commissioners was, "You foolish woman, you have paid too much." Therefore, whether they agreed or not the Estates Commissioners were to interpose and say, "You are paying too much." They would never have the pluck to say to a landlord, "You are asking too little."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02610">Then they raised, this knotty question, and said the price should not be deemed to be equitable if it appeared to the Land Commission that any substantial part thereon represented the value of improvements made by the tenant or purchaser in the title for which he had not been compensated. Take the case of a tenant who had built a house forty years ago. Probably he had got a new lease or been allowed to hold on his tenancy from year to year. Then the question had to be determined whether all that enjoyment was compensation and that therefore the improvement had been compensated for, and whether that improvement, compensated for or not, had materially increased the purchase price. That was a knotty point. But the provision as to whom it was to be referred to was really the <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i> The clause said that any question which might arise as to whether an improvement was or was not made by the tenant or his predecessors in title, or whether the tenant or his predecessors in title had or had not been paid or compensated for any improvement, was
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0446"/>
<col>879</col>
to be referred to a legal Assistant Commissioner whose decision was to be final. It was very well that the decision was to be final, because if it were not final it would certainly be reversed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02611">A still further peculiarity was that this was to be without prejudice to any previous determination under the Land Acts. Then the first thing that the person who fixed the fair rent was to do was to determine whether the man was compensated, by enjoyment or otherwise, for the improvements he had made. If compensated a rent might be fixed upon, if not, it should not be fixed upon. This Commissioner was left to his own devices to plough his way through all these difficulties. Protect the remainder-ship by all means; protect the State by all means; see that the security was adequate; but to say that landlord and tenant were to be treated as infants and lunatics not able to make their own contract and to protect their own interests, was ridiculous legislation. It would be most mischievous if passed and if there were a Division on this Amendment to reject the clause he sincerely hoped he would be supported.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02619"><member>LORD BARRYMORE</member> moved to delete from subsection (1) the words "and the consent of the owner required by subsection (4) of that section shall cease to be required." He said he had two or three other Amendments on the Paper, and also, if necessary, an Amendment to leave out the whole clause. But he would say at once for the satisfaction of their Lordships, that what was wanted was that the consent of the landlord should be retained as at the present moment. The Clause extended considerably the definition of congested districts; it altered &#x00A3;5 rateable value to &#x00A3;10; and it made sundry other alterations to which they might take legitimate objection and which they might argue at very considerable length. But they were perfectly satisfied, if the consent of the landlord was retained, that the alterations of the definitions should be made.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02620">Under Section 6, subsection (5), of the Land Act of 1903 a congested district was defined as being an estate of which at least half consisted of holdings not exceeding &#x00A3;5 in rateable value, or of mountain or bog land, or not less than one-fourth of which was held in rundale or intermixed plots. By subsection (4) of the same section it was provided that the owner's consent should be necessary before the Lord Lieutenant should determine that the estate should be certified as a congested district. The alterations would, for instance, prevent the application of the zone system in the case of a congested estate. The changes would be advantageous for the small holders upon an estate, but there would probably also be a certain number of substantial larger farmers and they would be placed under a considerable disability if the zone system ceased to be operative in their case. It was very important in the landlord's interest, and in their interest, that they should not summarily be put in the position that they could be considered as part of a congested estate without any consideration or any remedy. This was a matter which was considered at great length during the discussions of the Bill in the year 1903, and the consent of the landlord was at that time required and inserted in the Act. The section had worked well so far, and there was no reason whatever why the consent of the landlord
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0447"/>
<col>881</col>
should be removed. He must press his Amendment if the Government declined to accept it. He sincerely hoped, however, that they would accept it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02622"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the noble Lord the mover of the Amendment had stated that the Act as it stood had worked exceedingly well. On page 8 of the last Report of the Estates Commissioners were the following words&#x2014;
<quote>"In the years during the period from November 1, 1903. to March 31, 1908, the Commissioners certified to the Lord Lieutenant that twenty congested districts were bought."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02623">That was the measure of the successful working of the provision to which the noble Lord alluded. In those six years, owing to the words which the noble Lord desired to retain, the efforts of the Estates Commissioners to relieve congestion had been absolutely frustrated. If their Lordships desired that congestion outside the congested districts ought to be relieved they were bound to remove the words in question from the Act. The noble Lord had also stated that these words were introduced into the Act with the consent of both Houses of Parliament. That was quite true, but when the Bill came up to their Lordships' House in 1903 the words were not contained in it. They were introduced in their Lordships' House; and in the Lower House, the Members of which were wearied with the conflict, they were passed. The result was that from that time to the present outside the congested districts there had been absolutely no relief of congestion. Their Lordships' action on this Amendment would be a good test of their desire to relieve congestion in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02624"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member> said the noble Lord who had just sat down seemed to have immense confidence in the Estates Commissioners. He (Lord Ashtown) confessed he had not, and he did not think many other noble Lords had either. It was necessary that they should have some protection against these Commissioners. They had had the power of refusing their consent to make their estates congested with a valuation of &#x00A3;5. Now the valuation had been raised to &#x00A3;10, and that made congestion far
<col>882</col>
more serious. Personally, he thought the valuation of different holdings was not in the least a test. Congestion meant poverty and misery, or was supposed to mean it. A &#x00A3;10 valuation was supposed to represent poverty and misery. He denied that; altogether, and he could prove it on his own estate. He had very few congested holdings, very few indeed before this increase came on; but when they increased the &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;10 they would enormously add to the number of congested holdings. He would cite a few items on his estate to show the "misery" there. One tenant with a valuation of &#x00A3;3 earned, with his family, &#x00A3;1 2<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> a week in wages. Another tenant had a valuation of &#x00A3;7; he and his family earned &#x00A3;1 4<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> a week in wages. Another had a valuation of &#x00A3;2 12<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>,. he and his family earned &#x00A3;2 3<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> a week in wages Another, with a valuation of &#x00A3;8 5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, earned &#x00A3;1 a week in wages, and &#x00A3;1 5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> a week might be coming in if one of the men had behaved himself. Another with a &#x00A3;9 valuation earned &#x00A3;4<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> a week, and a tenant with a valuation of &#x00A3;4 9<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> earned twenty-four shillings week. Was he to admit that his estate was a case of poverty and destitution?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02625"><member>THE EARL OF LEITRIM</member> said he noble Lord opposite had mentioned in the first part of his speech that there were only twenty estates which the Estates Commissioners had bought, but he did not mention till the end of his speech that that was outside the-area of the congested districts. Twenty estates did not include all the estates. He (Lord Leitrim) did not think that point, need therefore be taken into account. Further, to give some idea of the valuation placed on a farm of less than &#x00A3;10 he might say that the average value of the tenant-right in the union of County Donegal, which was said to be a congested estate, was fifty-two years purchase of the rent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02626"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend behind me stated the objections to the noble Lord's Amendment so clearly that I really have very little to add to what he said. But I confess it does seem to me that the acceptance of this Amendment offers a very singular commentary on what was so freely said before we adjourned for dinner as to the necessity of acquiring land for the relief of those within the congested districts outside these districts. We were overwhelmed by arguments. When it was a question of a single landless man outside getting a farm,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0448"/>
<col>883</col>
the whole of it was required for migrants from congested districts, and yet when there is a question of making it possible to migrate&#x2014;the noble Lord behind me pointed out what obstacles had hitherto been placed in the way of acquiring land for any such purpose&#x2014;noble Lords desire to amend our Bill in a way which obviously must tend to make it infinitely more difficult. Lord Ashtown spoke of certain cases within his own knowledge where those who had land on a small valuation earned money in other ways. Of course there is a certain number of such cases everywhere. In no country but Ireland would these people be spoken of as farmers at all. They are labourers who have a little bit of land, hardly coming within the meaning of what we call a small holding in some cases. I quite agree that for a community entirely composed of such people to be spoken of as a congested district or even a congested 'estate would give a wrong impression of what was meant by congestion. There I agree entirely, but that, although I admit its force, it not really the point. What happens Under these transactions?

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02632">Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02633"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> had an Amendment on the Paper proposing to alter the meaning of the expression "congested townland." He had to confess to their Lordships that, in the Minute which he recorded on the Report of the Congestion Commission, he was betrayed into a mistake. The mistake consisted in suggesting a definition of congestion which depended more upon the numerical proportion of congested holdings in a townland than on the proportional area of the townland which such congested holdings covered. It was quite possible, as many of their Lordships acquainted with the West of Ireland would know, to have a townland consisting of 1,000 acres, of which 950 acre might be in one grass farm held by one tenant, while fifty acres might be five-acre plots held by ten tenants. Such a townland as that would, under the, definition suggested in the Bill, be declared to be a congested townland. Obviously such a townland ought not properly to be considered congested, because although the fifty acres held by the ten tenants holding five acres each might properly be regarded as congested, yet by the employment which would probably be afforded by the occupier of the large area certain means would be supplied to the tenants of the ten holdings which would enable them to eke out their subsistence otherwise than from their land. Therefore in order to adjust the deficiency of his definition he suggested that there should be not only a numerical test but also a test in regard to the area which was occupied by the congested holdings. His present proposal
<col>886</col>
was that no townland should be regarded as congested unless one half of the holdings were also congested and unless these holdings covered a quarter of the total area of the townland.</p>

As the clause now stands there certainly might come within it singular cases, cases even more singular than those which the noble Lord mentioned in his speech. A townland might consist of three holdings, one enormously large and two under the limit, and yet as the clause stands as it would be spoken of as congested. But I think it would be better if my noble friend would agree that the Amendment should be moved in this form, to leave out from the second "townland" to the end of line 17 and to insert "more than a quarter of the area of which consist of."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02638"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: In the absence of Lord Barrymore, moved to omit Clause 21. His reason for doing so was that it made a complete change in the arrangement which was come to after
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0450"/>
<col>887</col>
much consideration under the Act of 1903, when it was decided what exactly a congested estate was. It was provided that it was an estate at least half of which consisted of buildings not exceeding &#x00A3;5 in rateable value. He was not going into the other points, because that was the one to which he wished specially to draw attention. The present proposal raised the &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;10, which seemed to him a very great change and one which materially affected all the considerations they had before them as to the relief of congestion in Ireland. It seemed to him that they ought to devote themselves first of all to getting rid of congestion as defined in that Act. Afterwards, when they had done that successfully, it would be open to extend the meaning of the term. To his mind the idea of &#x00A3;10 as necessary for an economic holding was, he would not say novel, but it was an idea that had sprung up and had been much more generally accepted within the last two or three years than previously. He was doubtful altogether about the question of economic holdings, when he saw through the length and breadth of Ireland new uneconomic holdings, called labourers' cottages, being created. He had no doubt all these labourers would claim to have their holdings extended so as to make them economic within a short time. In the meantime it was a very serious change to make to double the amount which constituted a congested estate, and he begged to move the deletion of the clause. There were some other portions of the clause which might not be so objectionable, and if any suggestion was made to put the matter in an altered form on Report he would be very glad to consider it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02640"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said he had heard the noble Lord with amazement. It took him back to the time more than seventy years ago when a &#x00A3;5 holding was considered to be economic. If there was anything which was proved to satisfaction by the evidence taken by the Dudley Commission&#x2014;which he ventured to think, from the statement of the noble Lord, he could not have seen&#x2014;it was that &#x00A3;10 was a moderate estimate. The majority of the witnesses said &#x00A3;12
<col>888</col>
was the amount that ought to be taken. If their Lordships were to accept such a proposal as suggested by the noble Lord they would be completely stultifying themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02641"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend behind me has moved the omission of this clause. We have been engaged for some time in inserting Amendments which I presume, in the view of those who were responsible for them, have considerably improved that clause. Therefore I confess I should rather hesitate, after what has happened, to advise the Committee to get rid of the clause altogether. I am rather strengthened in that view because I observed that my noble friend in the short speech which he delivered only referred to one particular point in the clause&#x2014;I mean the substitution of &#x00A3;10 for &#x00A3;5. I think there is a great deal to be said about that, but I would rather like to put it to my noble friend, if that is really the only point to which he desires to invite the attention of the Committee, whether that is sufficient argument for taking the whole of the clause out of the Bill. I would venture to ask him whether he would not allow the clause to remain in the Bill for the present, and reserve to himself the right when we come to the Report stage to ask the House to substitute the lower for the higher figure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02642"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> said that after what the noble Marquess had said he would not press his Amendment at this stage. Lord MacDonnell had referred to the Dudley Commission and said that if the Committee did not accept the conclusion of that Commission they would be stultifying themselves. He did not know what Lord MacDonnell would say to the Government, because they had not accepted the recommendations of the Dudley Commission in a great many respects.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02655"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member> intimated that in the circumstances he would not move his Amendment, which provided that any person aggrieved by any order or decision of one Commissioner might require his case to be re-heard by all three Commissioners sitting together.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02656"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said the matter was not quite so simple as it looked. The proposal of the Government, after giving a tremendous addition to and intensifying the importance of the duties of the Commissioners, was to provide that they might delegate any of these great duties to one of their number. It was obvious that that was not a thing that could be assented to. He did not like the principle of delegation; but it might be possible and more acceptable to say that two should be clothed with full jurisdiction to carry out important duties, sitting together. He thought that might be a tribunal that was reasonable, at all events more reasonable than to have one Commissioner. Then there might be some routine functions more or less, not functions involving decisions on important matters in reference to sales but the carrying out of details of what had been decided by the two, and some provision might be made, as happened in many tribunals, that one should do these technical and more or less formal things. He did not say his Amendment was the best way of doing what he wanted, and he was willing to study very carefully the words of the Government. The best course, he thought, would be to withdraw the whole matter now and bring it up on Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02657"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think that would be the simplest course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02658"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that even Lord Ashbourne's suggestion would seriously complicate the business of the Estates Commissioners. They did not transact their business always at meetings. Files were circulated from one Commissioner to another and they recorded
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0452"/>
<col>891</col>
their opinions upon these files. If two Commissioners agreed to a particular course, that was taken to mean the opinion of the majority of the Commission, and action was taken accordingly. It would seriously complicate the transaction of public business to insist on the sittings which were mentioned in Lord Ashbourne's Amendment. No difficulty had occurred up to the present time, and if Lord Ashbourne's proposal was modified in the way he would suggest the situation would be met. He suggested that a proviso should be inserted to the effect that the powers of the Estates Commissioners might be "exercisable by a majority and anything so done should be as valid and effectual as though it were done by all the Estates Commissioners," and so on for the remainder of Lord Ashbourne's proviso.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02659"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said there was this danger that they were immensely increasing the jurisdiction of these gentlemen. They were all familiar in Ireland with the expression "files"&#x2014;the bundles of papers dealing with the particular case fastened together, which were sent about. They went to one special Commissioner who had to do with the matter. He would write a minute on it, which would be taken by someone in the office to one of the other Commissioners, and there was always, he would not say the danger, but the great probability, that this Commissioner would look at it, would read the minute, and knowing that his colleague was familiar with the case forthwith initial it. That would be the work of two Commissioners, but it would not satisfy what he meant&#x2014;that the two should give their minds to working out the solution. Unless some words were put in showing that there must be two Commissioners applying their minds independently to arrive at a solution after full consideration, it would not be satisfactory. He thought in all the circumstances it was better not to put in words just now, and he would see what could be done before the Report stage.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02661">Clauses 28 to 31 agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02662">Clause 32:</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02663">32.&#x2014;(1) When the Land Commission deem it expedient to expend any money on the improvement of a holding sold or agreed to be sold
<col>892</col>
by a landlord to a tenant, they may, in. accordance with regulations to be made by the Treasury, enter into an agreement with the tenant for the repayment of the money so expended in the same manner as if such money was advanced under the Land Purchase Acts for the purchase of the holding, and the said money shall be repaid by an additional annuity accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02664">(2) So far as circumstances admit the additional annuity shall in accordance with regulations to be made by the Treasury be consolidated and made payable with the purchase annuity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02665">(3) Regulations made by the Treasury may provide that where the repayment of any money expended by the Land Commission is secured by an additional annuity under this section, the National Debt Commissioners may advance to the Land Commission the said money for repayment to the reserve fund if that fund has not been exhausted, and if that fund has been exhausted, for repayment to the Exchequer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02666"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member> said he had put down an Amendment to leave out this clause with a view to getting some idea from the Government of their views on the subject. As he read the clause it appeared to him to put a very heavy and unnecessary expenditure on the Treasury. The principle of the clause was that the Land Commission must practically provide, money for the improvement of any farm which might come under their purview, and apparently they were referred to Section 12 of the Act of 1903 for that purpose. As far as he read that Section of the Act, however, the object was not to give the Commissioners the power it was now proposed they should have; it was not to assist them in making roads and fencing and in the erection of farm buildings, &amp;c., before re-sale. On the other hand, the clause in the Bill appeared to give the Estates Commissioners very large spending powers in addition to their Powers for the purchase of farms, and those spending powers were to be exercised by means of drafts on the Land Purchase Fund for the purpose of improving holdings which might be agreed to be sold by landlords to tenants. He thought their Lordships would agree that it would be much better if any expenditure was to be undertaken for improvements in these cases it should be provided for under the system of loans from the Board of Public Works. He did not suppose for a moment that the Land Commission would expend a very large sum of money on such improvements, but they might spend on improvements which were practically unnecessary, and they would have to utilise money which was placed at their disposal for the purchase of holdings. It struck him that this
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0453"/>
<col>893</col>
was a very unnecessary expenditure, and he should be glad to hear the views of the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02667">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out Clause 32."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Castletown.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02668"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: We have no idea under this provision of adding to the powers which the Estates, Commissioners already possess under Section 12 of the Act of 1903. They are empowered in certain circumstances, as the noble Lord very well knows, to expend money, but when they do that money can only be secured by an ordinary mortgage. This clause in the Bill enables that sum to be secured in the form of an annuity as though it represented part of the purchase money. Therefore there is no difference, so far as the Estates Commissioners are concerned, but there is an advantage to the tenant who is able to obtain this money on somewhat easier terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02669"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the Committee had rejected the proposal which he made that congested estates should be sold direct to the Estates Commissioners in order that congestion might be removed and the condition of the people improved in the proper way. Failing that proper and efficient way of dealing with congestion, the Government proposed in this clause to do the next best thing&#x2014;namely, to help the tenants to improve their own holdings. The noble Lord, Lord Castletown, proposed that the Government should be deprived of the opportunity of making advances to the tenants for the improvement of their own holdings and of securing the repayment of such advances on the easy terms which the Bill prescribed. He (Lord MacDonnell) thought, however, that it was only necessary to state the case to their Lordships in order to secure a verdict from them in favour of the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02670"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> agreed with Lord MacDonnell in what he had just said. There was a difficulty under the Act of 1903 where money was advanced to improve a farm bought direct from the landlord by the tenant, because there was no means of securing the repayment of that advance by the purchase annuity. He therefore thought this clause was absolutely necessary.</p>
<col>894</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02671">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02672">Clause 32 agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02673">Clause 33:</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02674">33. For the purposes of subsection (4) of section forty-eight of the Act of 1903, an estate shall be deemed to be so circumstanced that it would, independently of the Act of 1896, be sold without the consent of the owner as to price if the consent of the person who is owner would not be required in his capacity as owner, notwithstanding that his consent might be required in the capacity of incumbrancer or some other capacity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02675"><member>LORD FARNHAM</member> wished to move to leave out the clause, which, he said, proposed to extend in a most unfair way the restrictions contained in subsection (4) of Section 48 of the Act of 1903. If Clause 33 of the Bill were passed he could assure their Lordships that it would be a very severe blow to a certain class of landlords. Subsection (4) provided that the earlier part of the section relating to the bonus should not be extended to estates so circumstanced that they could be sold without the owner's consent. The general effect of that was that the owner of an estate which had become so encumbered as to be insolvent could not have a voice in the sale of his estate by the Land Judge, and that he therefore received no bonus. But it had been judicially held that if this same landlord himself held mortgages on the estate he was to be entitled to object to the price he might be offered, and that consequently he would obtain the bonus. That was a most fair and just decision, but it was completely done away with by Clause 33. In order to convince their Lordships of the unjust effect the clause would have, he would try to show how it was many landlords had come to be placed in such a position that they would be hurt by the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02676">He would first take the case of a landlord who had not only inherited his estate but had inherited it in a most encumbered state. That estate was encumbered by an ancestor and at the time he encumbered it the rental was at a figure very different from that it stood at to-day. Therefore although the estate must have been very severely crippled, there was a sufficient margin between, what he had to pay and the rent he received for him to have a comfortable income. The ancestor might from time to time have bought up some of those
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0454"/>
<col>895</col>
charges either with money which he himself had earned or with money which he had saved by a careful nursing of the rental, or those charges might have been left to him by a member of his family who held a mortgage on the estate. Eventually the present day owner found that owing to the rental being severely cut down he had no margin left and the estate had become insolvent. He was, therefore, placed in this position. As actual owner of the estate, through no fault of his own but owing to a series of Acts of Parliament which had cut down the rental he was insolvent; but as an encumbrancer on his estate, he was receiving benefit from that estate, and, under the Act of 1903, he would be entitled to have a say in the sale of the estate and also to receive the bonus, and most justly so. Under Clause 33 of the Bill, however, he would not be allowed to have that benefit, and that would be most hard and unjust upon him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02677">Another instance was that of a landlord who had bought his estate either in the Encumbered Estates Court or in the Land Court. He might have bought that estate, which was put up for market in the Land Court, on the understanding that the rental was a low one. For the purposes of the illustration their Lordships might suppose that the rental was valued at &#x00A3;1,000. To purchase the estate the landlord borrowed a certain sum of money and found the remainder from his own pocket. They might suppose that the amount of money he borrowed necessitated his paying a charge of &#x00A3;750 a year, and that left him with a margin of &#x00A3;250 on which to live. As in the other case which had been taken as an illustration, this owner either bought rap charges, or perhaps was left charges, and became an encumbrancer on his own estate. Eventually, again through no fault of his own, but owing to a series of Acts of Parliament, the rental of &#x00A3;1,000, which he understood when he bought the estate was a low one and not likely to be reduced, was cut down to &#x00A3;750. The estate then became insolvent and the owner was placed in the same position as the landlord in the other case. As owner of the estate he was insolvent, but as an encumbrancer he was receiving benefit from the estate. This man also would, under Clause 33, be very severely hit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02678">He would cite yet another case, and this, perhaps, was the most unfair one of all. A
<col>896</col>
man whose estate was very heavily encumbered had just been able to keep his head above water and struggle on. He had been able to settle with his encumbrancers not to push the estate into court. If he had sold the estate, owing to the loss the sale would have caused, it would have meant absolute ruin to him. Then the Act of 1903 was passed, and under it the owner was able to sell his estate without loss, because he would be entitled to receive a bonus. The owner and his encumbrancers consented that the estate should be sold after the passing of the Act of 1903. It was sold, but the owner had not yet received the money for the estate, and under Clause 33 of the Bill he would, when he was paid for the estate, not be entitled to receive the bonus, although it was only on the understanding that he would get the bonus that he had consented to sell. He (Lord Farnham) thought their Lordships would agree that if that man was to be deprived of the bonus under the circumstances described it would be a very hard and unjust case. He hoped, therefore, that the Government would see their way to allow Clause 33 to be removed from the Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02680"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: This is a legal point of some complexity, and I dare say before the question is put from the Chair we shall hear what noble and learned Lords have to say upon it. As the law stands at present under Section 48, subsection (1), of the Act of 1903, as the noble Lord opposite said, an estate which is so insolvent that it has to be sold by the Land Judge, receives no bonus on the ground that the owner has no interest in the estate. But it appears that as the law stands under that Act, if this insolvent owner possesses any share in a charge on the estate&#x2014;and I gather it would be the case no matter how small that share is&#x2014;he then is regarded as having an interest in the estate in the character of an encumbrancer, and can, I imagine, receive the whole of the bonus on the sale of the estate. If so, I must say that does not seem to me a reasonable state of things.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite mentioned various cases which he considered to be cases of hardship. The first class of case referred to was the case which I have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0455"/>
<col>897</col>
described. That is to say, where a man may have inherited from a relation or acquired in some other way a small share of the mortgage on his own property he technically acquires an interest in the whole estate, although he is declared to be by Section 48 of the Act of 1903 an insolvent owner. I cannot believe that the authors of that Act intended that the bonus should be payable under those circumstances, but perhaps we shall hear what construction the noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Ashbourne, places upon it. I did not quite follow the last case mentioned by the noble Lord. It was a case apparently of an estate sold by mortgagees in possession where, through an agreement with him, some share of the estate was allowed to remain technically in the possession of the owner, with the result that he received the bonus. I should have thought that also was an evasion of the intention of Section 48 of the Act of 1903. So far as I am able to understand it, the intention of that Act appears to be carried out in Clause 33 of the Bill which the noble Lord opposite proposes to omit. I am afraid, therefore, that we must stand by the retention of the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02681"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said his noble friend, Lord Farnham, had stated his case with great clearness and fulness, showing that he had given the matter every consideration. He (Lord Ashbourne) assumed that this clause had been put in the Bill to inset a decision which had been given in the Irish Courts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02682"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think it was the case of Holmes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02683"><member>LORD ASHBOUNRE</member> said that of course any decision given in the Irish Courts must have been given after full argument and consideration of all the facts. He had not himself read the case, but naturally he had a great respect for the way legal business was done in Ireland. He was sure that the case would be well argued by able counsel and that the Judge would give his best consideration to the matter. He assumed the case was considered somewhat from the point of view that Lord Farnham had presented. It might well be that the man who was technically the owner had a poor estate with a very slender margin. He might have had rich friends or relations, or have married a lady plentifully endowed with
<col>898</col>
this world's goods, and the result might have been that all the charges on the estate, though very large, were bought up and vested in the owner, making a man of him again. Very likely the position of the estate was not due to any act of his own, but the encumbrances were there when he came into the estate. That was to say, he might have come into an estate which was known in law as a <i>damnosa hereditas.</i> It might have been worth very little, but was really represented in value by the large encumbrances upon it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02684"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Might I ask whether in that case a reasonable course would not be to extinguish the encumbrances rather than hand them over to the tenant for life or whoever might have the estate?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02685"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he was dealing with the fact that a decision had been given by a tribunal which he supposed was endowed with authority to exercise jurisdiction. He assumed also that, as there was no appeal, whoever was interested in the question acquiesced in the decision. As he had said a technical owner might succeed to property which alone was worth very little indeed, but he might become possessed of charges which really made the whole value of the property. He supposed the Judge came to the conclusion that inasmuch as that owner must have a potential voice in the sale of the estate it would under the circumstances be reasonable that he should not be ignored. He had not himself read the decision in this particular case, but he presumed that it proceeded on some such basis as that, and therefore he could quite understand his noble friend Lord Farnham being struck with the great hardship of seeking to act after a decision by putting a short clause in a Bill to say that what was held by the Courts should no longer be the law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02686"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> remarked that this was a very technical question. It seemed to him from what had been said by the noble Earl the Leader of the House and his noble friend Lord Farnham, that if this clause were not agreed to there would be a claim for a bonus which in other cases would not occur. It was his wish to protect the Treasury against unreasonable claims, and, so far as he could understand the matter, he did not think he would be justified in supporting
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0456"/>
<col>899</col>
his noble friend in his proposal to omit the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02687"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said the bonus was given as an inducement to a landlord to sell. What was decided in the case referred to was this. Where a landlord was insolvent and had no power of dissenting from the sale of his estate in his capacity as owner, by purchasing or securing possession of any charge on the estate he could object to the sale, not by virtue of his rights of ownership, but by virtue of being an encumbrancer. In that way he could get the bonus, which, had the encumbrance been in the hands of anybody else, he could not have obtained. With every desire that the landlord should get the bonus, he was bound to say he did not think that was a case coming within the spirit of the Act of 1903. Therefore he could not support the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02688"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> did not think many eases of the kind referred to would arise in Ireland. He quite understood that the object of the Treasury in this Bill was to save every penny they possibly could. The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, had stated that he did not wish the Treasury to be mulcted through the payment of bonuses in the cases referred to. But the clause really wiped out the decision of the Courts, and therefore with one stroke of the pen the Treasury were given a pull in the matter. He did not think that the question of the cost to the Treasury was so serious as was imagined, because the cases would not be numerous or frequent. Though the remarks of the noble Viscount were against the contention of the supporters of the Amendment, he thought they had a right to "fight their own corner," seeing that the Treasury were trying to get a pull by doing away with the decision of the Courts in order to escape the payment of the bonus in these cases.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02689"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: There are two cases we have to consider. A landlord has several mortgages on his estate and the mortgages are more than the value of the whole property. If a case like that arises no bonus is payable because the landlord's consent to the sale of the estate is not required. In the second case the landlord is an acute person in exactly the same position, but he is a wise man and buys up &#x00A3;100 of a mortgage, which may
<col>900</col>
be for &#x00A3;25,000. By acquiring an interest of &#x00A3;100 in the mortgage, for which I suppose he would have to pay pretty heavily, he gets the bonus on the whole value of the property. The noble Earl, Lord Mayo, said that was a thing which would not often happen. It would happen very frequently if once it were pointed out that the results are as I have described.</membercontribution></p>

<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) The proprietor shall not without the consent of the Land Commission acquire by purchase any other holding for the purchase of which an advance has been made under the Land Purchase Acts if the amount of that advance then outstanding, when added to the amount of the advance or advances made in respect of the holding or holdings then held by the proprietor, would exceed the sum of five thousand pounds, and if any proprietor acquires any holding in violation of this condition the Land Commission may cause that holding to be sold:</li>

<image src="S5LV0003P0I0457"/>
<col>901</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02697"><member>LORD INCHIQUIN</member> moved to leave out paragraph (<i>a</i>). The subsection meant that the proprietor of a holding who had bought his holding was not allowed to buy any other holding for which purchase money had been advanced, either with his own money or with any money he could get, where the value of the two holdings together came to more than &#x00A3;5,000, without the consent of the Land Commission. This paragraph appeared to him to be in many ways a little hard. To begin with, it would limit very largely free-trade in land in Ireland, and there seemed to him to be no earthly reason for doing that. This was a matter which affected the tenants only. At any rate it affected the landlords only in one possible case. The provision was most unfair to all the parties concerned. It was unfair to the vendor because it restricted the market in which he could sell. A great many holdings in Ireland were sold year by year, generally by public auction, but sometimes by private treaty, and they invariably fetched good prices. Those who had witnessed what took place when there was a public auction and holdings came under the hammer knew very well that by far the greater part of the bargaining was done by men who had already purchased their holdings. The result of the Government's proposal would be that when the whole of Ireland had been purchased and a holding had to be resold there would be no buyers left, because men who had already purchased would be debarred from acquiring more land. The provision was also unfair to the man who had already bought his holding, because it would not allow him to improve his holding by adding to it. He might require a piece of grass or meadow land to develop the success of his holding, and if an opportunity occurred for him to buy what he needed it would be very hard were he not allowed to do so. The hardship became all the more apparent when it was remembered that the man would be using his own money and not money that was found by the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02698">The provision would also put a bar on the successful man because it was only the man who had been successful and was in a sound financial position who would be able to buy another holding. The only possible reason he could see for introducing the provision was that it would cheapen and widen the market for the purchase of land by the Congested Districts
<col>902</col>
Board or the Land Commission, because in time they would be the only people who would have an opportunity of buying. It would appear at first sight that the provision might affect the landlord in one way, because it might be thought that if he had bought his demesne he would not be able to buy another holding. He was told that that was not the case, but the landlord might be affected in another way. He would give a case of his own. At the present time he was buying a holding running practically into his own demesne, and supposing he wished to buy another holding on the other side of his estate he would be debarred from doing so if the value of the two exceeded &#x00A3;5,000. There might appear to be one reason for not allowing a man to have two holdings of a total value exceeding &#x00A3;5,000. It might look at first sight as if the man was not security enough for the money. They must remember the simple fact, however, that it was not the man who was the security, but the land. If he held his own holding and bought another holding those two holdings were security each for their own annuity. He might point out further that the clause was useless as it stood, because it was so easy to evade it. Any man could buy land in the name of his wife or one of his sons and in that way evade the whole provision.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02699">The final words of the paragraph were extraordinarily drastic. They said in effect that if a man did offend against this provision the Land Commissioners might cause the second holding he had bought to be sold, apparently even at a loss. He supposed the same old argument would come up again, that the Government were only giving the Commissioners power to interfere and that they would not exercise it. The argument had been used so often taht they mistrusted it and they also mistrusted the Commissioners, because if power were given to them they would always have the temptation to use it. He would much rather that a definite plan was laid down and that the Commissioners should not be given the option of interfering.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02701"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said the speech of the noble Lord was an argument in favour a the consolidation
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0458"/>
<col>903</col>
of holdings and the reintroduction of the system which this Bill was endeavouring to dissolve. It meant the reintroduction under infinitely worse auspices than those which now prevailed of the old system. If the Legislature thought it right that the landlords of Ireland should now be asked to sell their estates and distribute them amongst the tenants, was it likely that the public opinion of the country would allow the consolidation of those holdings in the hands of men who would use their power infinitely worse than the very worst landlord that any picture of Irish life had depicted? The object of this provision was to prevent the consolidation of holdings again and the reintroduction of a system which the present legislation was devised to put an end to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02702"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend behind me has stated with admirable lucidity the reasons which have actuated His Majesty's Government in inserting this clause in the Bill. It is rather a singular fact if one comes to think of it that although all Purchase Acts have contained some limit as to the amount of advances which may be made for the purchase of land there is nothing whatever to prevent the purchaser of a farm acquiring from other people holdings to an unlimited extent and therefore obtaining in his own person the advantage of this State advance to an amount to which no boundary is set. I entirely agree with my noble friend behind me that of all the mischievous results that could follow the passing of these various Land Purchase Acts that of the aggregation of a number of purchase holdings would be the worst that could possibly be conceived. As my noble friend says, whatever may have been the disadvantages of the system of landlord and tenant in Ireland in the past, they would be accentuated and multiplied by such a state of things. The sole object of this clause is to prevent such an occurrence happening. It must be remembered that as the progress of the Act of 1903 goes on and more land is sold the greater becomes the danger of such an aggregation occurring. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will not support the noble Lord, Lord Inchiquin, in his desire to strike out this clause. The noble Lord spoke, as others have spoken, rather slightingly of the discretion given to the Estates Commissioners. I should have thought the kind of case he mentioned in which the landlord desired to buy a farm
<col>904</col>
forming a kind of peninsula into his demesne was one in which the Estates Commissioners would exercise the discretion given in the clause, but so far as general aggregation is concerned they would set their faces against it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02703"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I cannot help thinking that the clause causes a real hardship to the parties it will affect. As I understand the effect will be this. A tenant farmer who has bought his own holding is not to be allowed to buy a second holding if the purchase money of the two together exceeds a sum of &#x00A3;5,000. That is to say, a man who has bought a holding of reasonable size for &#x00A3;3,000 and who if another holding conies into the market adjoining his own desires to buy it will be forbidden to do so by this clause supposing the price of the second holding to be anything above &#x00A3;2,000. That seems to me to be a hardship to the man who desires to buy the second holding. Why is the limitation imposed? The Committee should remember that he will make this purchase out of his own private funds. It is his own money which he embarks in this legitimate investment in land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02704"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: He may embark his own money, but it must be another transaction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02705"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: He would be prevented from acquiring the second farm even if it were his own money he was going to invest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02706"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Supposing it was a farm bought under any of the Purchase Acts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02707"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Of course, I assume that to be the case. That seems to be a very genuine hardship, and the clause can only be explained by that hostility to large holdings which runs through this and other clauses of the Bill. There is also a very considerable hardship to the seller of the second farm, because this man who has already bought a holding and who is presumably a solvent and thrifty person, is a good customer. But under this clause all buyers of that class are to be shut out, and the number of bidders will be diminished in proportion. The noble Earl tells us the object of the clause is to prevent a process of consolidation under which the old landlord
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0459"/>
<col>905</col>
system would reappear in Ireland. I must say I think that is a rather far-fetched apprehension. I cannot believe, after all that has happened in Ireland to say nothing of what has happened elsewhere, that there is any risk whatever of <i>latifundia</i> appearing again in that country. That appears to be a very remote danger, and in order to guard against it it seems hardly necessary to place this disability on men who have bought their own holdings and have thriven so well that they have money available for adding to the land they occupy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02708"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member> could quite understand that His Majesty's Government were anxious to prevent the aggregation of land in large quantities occurring again in Ireland. That might be a very laudable ambition but it was absolutely impossible to carry it out. Men certainly in course of time would tend to accumulate more land than they had already bought, and this clause would not prevent that accumulation. There was nothing to prevent a man so long as he was not a farmer buying up any quantity of these holdings. The village usurer or anybody else could buy any quantity of land. All this clause did was to say that a man who had been successful in his business of agriculture was not to be able to increase his holding. That was very illogical.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02709"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CASTLETOWN</member> said the idea of the clause was very good. He agreed with what was said by the noble Earl the Leader of the House and by Lord MacDonnell as to the necessity of pre-
<col>906</col>
venting the aggregation of holdings. He had a good idea of his fellow countrymen, however, and he felt perfectly certain that whether their Lordships passed the clause or not they would make arrangements to buy up holdings whether those holdings were held from the Land Commission or not. Arrangements would be made through wives, sons, or cousins by means of which they would carry out a system of aggregation as they chose, quite independent of whether this clause was in existence or not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02710"><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> wished to put one question. In case a man purchased a second farm and the Commissioners intervened and sold that farm, what was to become of the purchase money? He did not see any provision in the clause dealing with that point. It seemed to him that the man should at least be given back the money he had paid in hard cash for the farm. He did not suppose that the Commissioners intended to pocket the money.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02721">[THE EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02722">Clause 35:</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02723">35. The Land Commission, where interest on the purchase-money of any holding is payable to them, shall have for the recovery of such interest the same remedies as they have for the recovery of unpaid instalments of a purchase annuity, and in addition and without prejudice to those remedies, may, if they think fit, exclude from the estate any holding in respect of the purchase-money of which one year's interest is in arrear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02724"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> moved to leave out all words after the word "annuity." He could not imagine what malignant imp could have been near the Chief Secretary or whoever drafted the Bill to influence him to put these words in the clause. There were at present some scores of thousands of agreements made between landlords and tenants, and fifty-two millions of cash would be required to finance them. Landlords had in most cases dealt with the entire estate and had sold to their tenants. If the cash was not forthcoming to finance agreements like those, the purchaser paid interest on the purchase money pending a completion of the agreement, and the vendor received that interest. Under this clause the Land Commission were taking increased powers to recover interest as it accrued. The lines in the clause which he proposed to strike out enabled them, if any tenant fell into arrear with his annuity, to tear up his agreement and throw him back with his holding on the hands of his landlord. Take the case of a landlord who sold his estate that had probably thirty tenants on it for a sum of &#x00A3;30,000. He would not be likely to get it for ten years, and the Land Commission would collect the interest. If one of the tenants did not pay, in place of selling him up, back he was landed on the landlord's hands. What was the landlord to do? As a matter of fact the landlord could not make a new agreement, or if he did it was a future one, bringing in only three per cent. He could not conceive any one having the primordial notion of primitive justice suggesting a procedure of that kind. He would wait for something to be urged in its favour, for nothing was urged in its favour in the other House. The only argument that he heard of being used was that the landlord should be allowed to do his dirty work himself. But the landlord had
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0461"/>
<col>909</col>
carried out the policy of the Act, and because the debt was not paid the tenant was to be thrown back on the landlord's hands and the agreement torn up. It seemed that the moment a man refused to pay his debts all human vices were supposed to be centred in any one who asked for payment, and credit was invariably given to the man who failed to discharge his obligations.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02726"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member><membercontribution>: This clause to which the noble and learned Lord takes such strong exception is intended to place a somewhat further power of pressure in the hands of the Estates Commissioners in cases where tenants do not pay interest. The noble and learned Lord argues&#x2014;and I do not say without cause&#x2014;that it would be a hardship in such a case to throw back the tenant who would not pay on the landlord's hands. On the other hand, it would be, I suppose, generally agreed that it is a hardship on the State to have to take over such a man as an annuity-paying tenant. The cases in which this particular power would be exercised would, I take it, be extremely rare, and it is, of course, an optional power. But our view is that it would enable a somewhat severe screw to be placed upon the tenants for the payment of interest in those cases where they fall into arrear. As a matter of fact, I believe it is the case that interest all over Ireland is very punctually paid, but there are certain exceptions, and it is desired to place a somewhat sharper weapon in the hands of those who are concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02727"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he had a similar Amendment on the Paper. He had listened to the reply of the noble Earl with attention, but he did not think the noble Earl had given any explanation or defence of this clause. He quite understood the earlier part of the clause, which gave the Laud Commission powers over a defaulting tenant who had omitted, after he had been freed from rent, to pay interest in its place. He believed that to be the present law, but no doubt that had been considered by the competent draftsmen in the Irish Office, and doubtless they had come to the conclusion that this drafting was better than in the Act of 1896. He did not
<col>910</col>
quarrel with that if the Government thought this part of the clause better in drafting, but the latter part of the clause was a new power proposed to be given to the Land Commission. The position was that if tenants on an estate did not pay their interest, instead of applying their existing powers to compel them to pay, the Government said to the unfortunate owner who had sold, "True, we made a contract, but now the tenants have made default. We will have the estate without these bad people upon it. You must take them back and deal with them as you may." What was the justification for that? He had listened most attentively to the noble Earl, as he always did, but the noble Earl did not in this case make his bricks as well as he did sometimes; the reason was he had so little straw. But take the thing quietly. Supposing a contract was made for three or four years, and the landlord had gone away. He might have died, and been succeeded by his son or those to whom his property would otherwise go. The hardship would be great. The noble Earl said these would be rare cases. If so, there would be the less hardship in striking this extraordinary proposition out of the Bill. If they were to be only rare cases, was it worth while making such a monstrous and unjust proposal? The noble Earl said it was to put the screw on. It would put the screw on, but the screw on whom? What right had they to put the screw on the landlord? He had completed his contract and done all that they required to do. The screw was not a screw on the tenant at all. The landlord would have no power to do anything, whereas the tenant was brought from a position of inconvenience to a position of comparative velvet. He was released from his obligation to the Land Commission and handed back to his landlord who could do but little. It would be a waste of time to point out the further injustices of this clause. He believed it was impossible to give priority to the injustices to be found here and there in this Bill, but he knew of nothing more glaring than this part of Clause 35 which his noble and learned friend and himself sought to omit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02728"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> pointed out that under the existing law the Land Commission had full powers to collect the arrears. If the tenant did not pay his arrears of rent, the farm was put up for sale. They all knew the wish for land in Ireland, and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0462"/>
<col>911</col>
there was not the smallest difficulty in getting a tenant to buy; but he had to pay the arrears before a conveyance of the land was made out to him, and the Land Commission was quite safe. This clause was really a screw on the landlord, who was landed with a tenant who had not paid his debt to the State. Such a tenant ought to be dealt with under the present law and the land put up to public auction. That was a simple way of dealing with it. The Land Commission had powers already to deal with it by public sale or civil action in the High Court. Why should the landlord suffer because this man did not pay his debt to the State? Surely landlords had suffered enough already from tenants who had not paid their rents, and if a man did not pay interest on his purchase the land ought to be put up to public auction in a country, where there was what was commonly called a land hunger.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02730">His noble and learned friend Lord Ashbourne had already dealt with what was called the screw. There could be no stranger way of punishing a man for being in debt than by putting the screw on the creditor. That was what was proposed. The extraordinary thing about this proposal was that the landlord could not recover the interest from the tenant. The body who could recover the interest were the Estates Commissioners, and because they would not recover it they put the tenant back on the landlord. The landlord would be glad to recover the interest if he could, but they had taken the power away from him. This was the most vicarious enactment he had ever heard of.</p>

The effect of the Amendment was that, in cases of purchase under the Land Purchase Acts, where rent had not been paid for a period of twenty years it should be taken to have been released, so that the superior interests might be measured by the amount of rent actually paid, and not by the amount of rent originally reserved and not paid. He was

The principle that he seeks to maintain is that you ought not to treat as subsisting, for the purpose of hindering the carrying out of a purchase, a charge which though in law is still unextinguished is yet practically obsolete and could not be collected, so that it only stands as a hindrance in the way without being operative to benefit anybody. A principle of that kind, of course, everyone who wants to facilitate business would be willing to recognise; but there is a consideration which will be present to all who are familiar with the working of Statutes of Limitations. This is, in effect, a species of limitation, and you ought to be very careful to safeguard the interests of persons under disability such as minors, lunatics, and persons whose whereabouts are not known. I might suggest that a difficulty, to begin with, is that one does not want to say anything final upon such short notice. It may well be that if the principle be accepted restrictions and provisos will have to be considered and inserted in the clause.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02762"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that was a specious invitation which he would decline
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0465"/>
<col>917</col>
for this reason. In his objection to this clause he claimed the support of noble Lords whether they approved of compulsion or disapproved of it altogether, or approved of it in a modified form limited to certain purposes and carried out by effective machinery through the agency of independent men. He claimed the support of all upon the principle upon which he objected to these clauses. They were entirely unnecessary for compulsion, and proof of that was found in the Small Holdings Act of 1907, with which the noble Lord was so familiar and of which he was so proud, and with the operation of which he was so satisfied. They had compulsion there. A county council, if it wanted to take land, had the power to take it; but there were in this Bill no preliminaries of the kind provided in the Small Holdings Act. His objection to these three clauses was on the one broad principle that they were attempting to set up compulsion by a system of public odium and hostility instead of by law. If the Commissioners wanted to take land compulsorily, they could do it as any other public body did. Let them publish a notice that they were going to take it, have the parties interested served with the notice, appear before some tribunal, and let the value of the land be assessed by some independent body.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02763">How would these clauses operate? The Commissioners would pounce on some man's land, whether he liked it or not. There was a provision that they might enter into proposals. They might propose to purchase an estate outside the congested districts, and he noticed, by the way, that the same power was given to the Congested Districts Board. They might go upon that land and inspect it and do anything they liked. They could make all inquiries and do all such things as might be necessary to make up their minds whether they would take it or not. If the landlord said, "You are only taking part of the land, and injuring what is left," he could appeal to the Land Commission to induce them to take the land that would be injured. He supposed that had some remote analogy to the power that existed under the Lands Clauses Acts to prevent a man taking only a part of a house by compulsion. Having done that, if the negotiations failed they then made a final offer, and unless it was accepted, compulsion was put in force. If there was to be compulsion it should
<col>918</col>
be under the ordinary law on the same system adopted in the Lands Clauses Acts, the Small Holdings Act, and the Town Planning Bill. They could follow any one of those methods, but this was a method of compulsion by public odium.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02764">What would happen in the West of Ireland if these clauses became law? Any noble Lord who did not know Ireland could not appreciate the effect of these provisions. Daily they were heaping up upon the Estates Commissioners different duties. The result was that all these powers which were given them were not performed by the Estates Commissioners at all, and they had to have a whole tribe of officials and underlings who really carried them out. The great agitation in Ireland was that there should be sales, not to the tenants direct, but to the Estates Commissioners because they could parcel land out as they got it amongst the landless men. Under this clause an official would be sent down to go upon the estate and inspect it. It would be perfectly well known that he was there and what price was offered for the land. What would be the position of the landlord if he did not agree to the terms? He would be the subject of moral compulsion because he would be held up to public odium and hostility. He might be boycotted and subjected to all kinds of annoyances and be treated as a man who, when the Commissioners were ready to give a fair value for his land, refused to take it. If they did take a man's land from him they ought to do it under the protection of a legal tribunal and arrange a way to give him adequate compensation to be fixed by independent men. They should not make him an object of hatred amongst his fellowmen on account of what they would regard as his obstinacy in refusing to sell his land.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02766"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member><membercontribution>: I confess I see a certain difficulty in discussing this question on the lines laid down by the noble and learned Lord, because it does seem to me somewhat anomalous and unusual to attempt to discuss the manner in which a particular public body is going to carry out its duty of compulsory purchase before you have decided whether you will admit the principle of compulsory purchase
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0466"/>
<col>919</col>
at all. The noble and learned Lord proposes to omit these three clauses&#x2014;Clauses 41, 42, and 43&#x2014;and he must discuss the question of compulsory purchase when he comes to Clause 43. It is practically the only opportunity he will have during the Bill, as far as I can see, for if these clauses come out it is clearly useless to consider the fourth part of the Bill at all, because the clauses after Clause 60 merely provide the manner in which purchase is to be carried out by the Estates Commissioners when they have exercised the powers given them under Clause 43. Therefore I find it a little difficult, I confess, to discuss the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, because I did not clearly follow what sort of machinery he would wish to bring into play, assuming for a moment, as I am bound to assume if we are to discuss the question, that he admits even by way of hypothesis, the possibility of compulsory purchase. The noble and learned Lord mentioned the Small Holdings Act applicable to this country. Does he want to bring into being in Ireland parallel machinery of that kind to purchase land by a public body with an appeal to a central authority? You have the Estates Commissioners there carrying out the purchase of land and it seems to me hardly conceivable if you are going to have compulsory purchase that you can leave the Estates Commissioners out of the business altogether. Who is going to decide what estate is wanted and on what evidence? Who is going to make the preliminary inquiry if it is not the Estates Commissioners? The noble and learned Lord supplied no answer to those questions. In no country can you lodge a demand to buy a piece of land compulsorily without some kind of information beforehand&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02768"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member><membercontribution>: What they do is this. They first try, as the Estates Commissioners would first try, to acquire the land by voluntary agreement, and that having failed they apply for compulsory powers. That is exactly what it is suggested that the Estates Commissioners should do. The noble and learned Lord's argument is that a sort of extra compulsion is put upon landlords by being held up to public dislike, if after it is known that a
<col>920</col>
particular piece of land has been inspected it is not sold. But there must have been in the past, and I should think there will be in the future, other cases in which the Estates Commissioners have looked at land, and found, for instance, that it did not suit their purposes for some reasons, and therefore they have not gone on with the negotiations. How when these preliminary negotiations are taking place is it to be known that in the last resort the Estates Commissioners will be prepared to exercise compulsion in respect to this particular piece of land? The Estates Commissioners, I take it, are always looking at land. Some they want and some they do not want, and therefore, if the landlord goes about saying, "I do not want to part with this land, but I believe the Estates Commissioners are going to take it from me," in such a case he has only himself to thank if he is held up to public odium. The transaction would be of an ordinary kind where land was being inspected by the Estates Commissioners with the possible intention to purchase. I confess I do not see where the public odium comes in, and if it is seriously the contention of the noble and learned Lord that land to be acquired in these very difficult and delicate circumstances by the Estates Commissioners for the relief of congestion must be bought without inspection by anybody, it seems to me the introduction of compulsion at all becomes hopeless; and I confess I do not see how the proceedings are to take place at all. I once more appeal to you whether it would not be simpler to arrive at some preliminary conclusion as to whether compulsion can be admitted in any circumstances and on any terms to relieve any difficulty, because if not it is a pure waste of time to discuss questions such as this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02769"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> said he had heard the noble Earl's last remark with satisfaction, because he thought they were straying a little from the main principle of this clause, which was the whole question of the compulsory sale of land in Ireland. On this very important question they in Ireland felt very strongly. The question was whether compulsory powers should be given for the taking of land in districts outside the area of congestion. In his opinion it was needful that the Government should show, before the powers were granted, that there was a real need for them, and that it was impossible to get land except by compulsion.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0467"/>
<col>921</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02770">He maintained that the Government had no right to ask Parliament to grant these powers when there was land available to be acquired by voluntary means. There was a great deal of land which might be acquired by voluntary agreement, but the real reason why it could not be obtained was that the Treasury had no money available for its purchase.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02771">The noble Earl had told them that at the present moment agreements had been come to between owners and occupiers of land to the extent of no less than &#x00A3;56,000,000. Therefore to ask their Lordships to pass a Bill to take land compulsorily when the Government had not paid for land which they could have acquired voluntarily was asking their Lordships to take a step which required considerable explanation. The first duty of the Government, like any other debtor, was to pay money that was due; therefore their first duty was to pay off those fifty-six millions which had been voluntarily agreed to on terms approved by the State before they asked their Lordships to pass a Bill to take land compulsorily. He understood from the noble Earl that instead of devoting the whole of the money that had been voted for the transfer of land it was proposed in this Bill to take a certain amount of money from what should go to the paying off of that fifty-six millions and devote it to taking land compulsorily. That was an extraordinarily strong measure for any Government to propose, and he hoped before the debate on this clause concluded they would have some satisfactory reason given for that course by the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02772">Throughout the debates on this Bill noble Lords opposite had declared that it was not their intention to take public money to expropriate the owners of property compulsorily. The Government had declared&#x2014;both the noble Earl the Leader of the House and the Lord Chancellor had stated it&#x2014;that they desired to encourage in every possible way the voluntary transfer of land between landlord and tenant. But would this clause go any distance to carry out those views? It would not. It would, on the contrary, almost kill the voluntary sale of land in Ireland. Would any seller of land take stock of a depreciated character when, if his land was taken compulsorily, he could have hard Cash? That in itself was an answer to noble Lords opposite when they declared
<col>922</col>
their desire to encourage voluntary sales. The noble Earl the Leader of the House had said&#x2014;
<quote>"The last thing we desire to bring about is the general endowment of compulsory purchase."</quote>
But the compulsory purchase clauses were capable of general application. What he could not gather from the Government was why they would not put their intentions, as shown by the noble Earl, into words in their own Bill and let their Lordships know what they really meant and how far they intended this question of compulsory purchase to be taken. The Government had told them that they meant compulsion to be exceptional. Was that the view of the Government's supporters in Ireland? He did not think that the Nationalist supporters of the Government in the House of Commons would endorse the view put before their Lordships by the noble Earl. The noble Earl had also told them&#x2014;
<quote>"If you desire the purposes for which and the occasions upon which compulsory powers should be employed to be stated there is no objection to these powers being limited by some reasonable definition."</quote>
What was that reasonable definition? They had never had it in another place, and they had not, so far as he could gather, had it from any member of the Government in their Lordships' House. He trusted that any member of the Government who replied to him would state specifically what was meant by these powers being limited by some reasonable definition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02773">What they had heard from the Government with regard to this matter was very vague and very plausible, but he would like to see in black and white and put into the Bill what they meant. The noble Earl had stated in one of his speeches that these compulsory powers were to be used on "cantankerous landlords." He supposed the noble Earl meant those landlords who would not agree to give away their land for nothing. But the noble Earl did not give them the number of these cantankerous landlords, and unless cases could be given where land could not be obtained except compulsorily, they should not give heed to the question of taking land compulsorily in Ireland. He denied that compulsory sale was absolutely necessary. He maintained that it was not wanted at all, and it was the duty of the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0468"/>
<col>923</col>
Government to give specific instances of cases where this extreme step was to be taken before their Lordships acceded to their request. He would quote what Mr. Birrell had said in another place&#x2014;
<quote>"For many a long day to come the cash at the disposal of the Estates Commissioners will be so small as to render it most unlikely that they will put into operation those compulsory powers."</quote>
Therefore the rejection of this clause at the present moment, according to Mr. Birrell, would be a very small matter. But it would be a very big matter indeed if they allowed, under this Bill, a system of compulsion which would act most injuriously on the whole question of land sale and purchase in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02774"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> said the noble Earl in charge of the Bill had suggested that it would be well to enlarge the scope of the discussion on this clause for the purpose of considering the whole question of compulsion. But this clause itself did not contain compulsion, though it did contain some provisions which might be necessary if they had compulsion. There were portions of this clause which might be objected to even by those who advocated compulsion. He would like to ask the Government two questions. Although, as the noble and learned Lord had pointed out, some portions of this clause might be considered of an inquisitorial character, the earlier part of the clause, paragraph (<i>a</i>), seemed to him to be not open to an objection of that kind. That paragraph seemed merely to give the initiative to the Estates Commissioners, which they did not now possess, for commencing negotiations with the owner of a property which they wished to acquire. He confessed he saw no objection to that. The next paragraph might be too wide, and he imagined that the concluding words might admit landless men, to which he should certainly object. Taking paragraph (<i>a</i>) as a whole, it might be necessary to amend it, but he confessed it did not seem to him to be open to the rather sweeping condemnation that the noble and learned Lord passed on the clause as a whole. As to paragraph (<i>b</i>), it seemed, as he said, to be of an inquisitorial character, and he should have thought that a less objectionable means of approaching the owner and acquiring the information desired might be inserted.</p>
<col>924</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02775"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> confessed that he regarded this clause pretty much in the same light as his noble friend Lord Monteagle. Under the Act of 1903 the practice had been that the Estates Commissioners were not to take the initiative in matters of purchase and sales with landlords, but were to await an application from the landlords to sell. He knew from practical experience that that was the attitude which the Estates Commissioners assumed when the Act first came into operation, but as time passed on and the desire of landlords to sell became more manifest the Estates Commissioners abandoned in certain cases that attitude of aloofness and did make proposals in certain cases to landlords. He thought that the object of this clause was to legalise that state of things, and to empower the Estates Commissioners to approach landlords instead of waiting for the landlords to approach them. He might be wrong; but he did not necessarily connect with this clause the idea of compulsion. From that point of view he thought, with his noble friend Lord Monteagle, that paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the clause was not open to serious objection; but he agreed with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, that the second part of the clause called for certain amendment, and that it was desirable, if inspectors and other officials were sent in to an estate, that the consent of the owner should be asked for, and that the owner should be at liberty to say "No, I do not want to have my estate looked into." He had known instances in which landlords in Ireland had offered to sell their estates but objected to having inspection made, because if inspection was made it became known to the tenants generally that a sale was in the air and consequently there was a tendency to hold back rent and so on, and the general arrangements and management of the estate became somewhat complicated. He had had personal experience of that. Some noble Lords now listening to him had sold their estates, directly dealing with the Congested Districts Board on those terms. The Board were able to assure themselves as to what the circumstances of the estate were and to make an offer on the basis of such knowledge, and the transactions were amicably carried through.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02776">He thought the intention of the noble and learned Lord was to object to this obtrusive-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0469"/>
<col>925</col>
ness on the part of the Estates Commissioners and to make their action dependent upon the acceptance by the owner of their wish to send in inspectors. If the clause could be reconstructed to give that meaning it would be better. He had a modification of it which would probably meet the wishes of the noble and learned Lord and their Lordships. He had drafted a sub-clause to be substituted for the subclause in the Bill as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"If the owner of a property agrees to enter into negotiations the Estates Commissioners may, for the purpose of ascertaining the boundaries, extent, and character of any untenanted land which they propose to purchase and to estimate the price to be offered for the same, call for the prescribed particulars from the owner or other persons interested in the estates and may depute any inspectors or other persons appointed by them to enter upon the estate or untenanted land and make all such inquiries and do all such things as may be necessary for the purposes aforesaid."</quote>
There the deputation of inspectors would depend entirely upon the consent of the owner. If he did not like them to inspect his property he would say so, and there would be no inspection. If he agreed to inspection&#x2014;and there was not much objection in his experience when there was a desire to sell and to buy&#x2014;then this procedure could reasonably be adopted, and this clause might pass without touching upon the great question of compulsion which came in under Clause 43.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02777"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said the objection lay to paragraph (<i>b</i>) of this clause. He gathered that Lord MacDonnell objected to that; but was there any necessity for further legislation on the point if they deleted subclause (2) which enabled the Estates Commissioners to send down and inspect? Was it necessary either to give them permission to open negotiations with landlords with regard to the sale of their estates? What he meant was, could not negotiations be entered into without further legislation? It was a quiet arrangement between the purchasing authorities and the vendors, and it seemed to him that nothing was required in the Bill to enable them to open negotiations. But to give them legal powers to go down and inspect was a very different matter. He suggested that if subclause (2) of the clause was taken out there was no further reason to enlarge upon the question.</p>
<col>926</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02778"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he desired to understand Lord MacDonnell's Amendment of this clause which was not on the Paper. As far as the owner of land was concerned if he consented to the Commissioners going down to inspect no legislation whatever would be required. But this might be possible and it was necessary to guard against it&#x2014;a tenant might cause annoyance and might refuse to allow the inspectors to go upon his farm. The only necessity for the clause then would be to enable them to go upon the land and examine it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02779"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD </member><membercontribution>: And to call for the prescribed particulars from the parties interested. They could not do that unless they had legal authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02780"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said they could ask for the particulars, but to say that they ought to get power in all cases to demand that the particulars should be furnished did not seem to be entirely necessary. With regard to the consent of the landlord, surely if the landlord had sent for the inspector he would only do that because he wanted to sell, and, of course, he would give the inspector all reasonable particulars to enable him to form an idea of the price he would offer. He could see no use whatever for the clause except for the purpose of arming the Estates Commissioners with powers against an obstinate tenant, who might take advantage of his position to prevent them going on the farm.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02781"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member><membercontribution>: I think it will be, perhaps, for the general convenience if I say a few words now on the more general question which the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, admitted lies behind this clause and the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord who has moved its omission. And it lies behind it ior this reason, that unless some form of compulsion is introduced into the Bill even subsection (1) of this clause Would not be a very necessary measure. The noble Lord on the Cross Benches, Lord Monteagle, pointed out that it might be a convenience to the Estates Commissioners to enter into negotiations with a landlord in the first place, instead of waiting for a landlord to enter into negotiations with them. And no doubt even without the possibility of compulsion there might be some convenience in that course, although I do not think it would be a very great matter.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0470"/>
<col>927</col>
The noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, asked whether that could not be done at present. I think the reason it cannot be done at present is that the Act of 1903 specifically empowers the landlord to make the first advance, and if the Estates Commissioners were to make an advance they would run the risk of being told to mind their own business, and it is conceivable that they might not desire to place themselves in that position. I think it cannot be disputed that subsection (2), to which exception has been taken, has been inserted here as part of the necessary machinery in cases where compulsion had to be brought into play. That is quite clear, and it was in consideration of that fact that I originally suggested that it was necessary now in some degree to face the whole question, at any rate so far as it is concerned with compulsion outside the congested districts. Lord Atkinson saw that quite clearly when he said, very truly, that supposing there was merely a matter of agreement between the Estates Commissioners and the landlord for inspection subclause (2) clearly ought to come out.<lb/>
The noble Marquess opposite has asked why it is that we are asking for compulsion in any degree outside the congested districts, and he repeated once more the fears which were expressed on the Second Reading that the effect of the provisions of the Bill would be to make compulsion the rule and not the exception. I endeavoured then to point out how strong the arguments were against that assumption. The noble Marquess said that hon. members from Ireland were in favour of compulsion, and, undoubtedly, they are in favour of the principle. But I have never seen anything said by an Irish member which would lead me to suppose that they are in favour of a general system of expropriation by cash payments in the manner provided by this Bill. It stands to reason, as I ventured to point out before, that nobody who supports this Bill can be in favour of general compulsory purchase, because general compulsory purchase involves payment in cash and cash only, and, therefore, the whole of our financial provisions and the hopes that we founded upon them must fall to the ground if a general system of compulsory purchase is instituted.<lb/>
The noble Marquess next asked what is the need for compulsory purchase of land, at any rate outside the congested districts. We have had some considerable discussion on the question of migration, and certainly
<col>928</col>
a great many of your Lordships opposite took the view that if it were possible to do so it would be desirable to acquire land outside the congested districts for the purpose of placing some of the inhabitants of the congested districts on economic holdings. What is the prospect of obtaining land for that purpose? The noble Marquess said that there was a great deal of land&#x2014;apart, I suppose, from that which was pending for direct sales&#x2014;which the Estates Commissioners might get and which they were not able to get because they could not pay for it. But it does not, I think, follow, even if that be so, that all that land is the particular land which the Estates Commissioners might require for their purpose. We have some evidence of the difficulty which the Estates Commissioners have found in the past of obtaining the kind of land which they want for their particular purpose. In the Return which they made in 1907 of their proceedings up to May 31 in that year in respect of persons applying as evicted tenants or their representatives for restoration to their holdings, it is stated that the Commissioners approached 1,752 persons who were shown in a Parliamentary Return as being the owners of untenanted land with a view to ascertain whether they were willing to sell such land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02782"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO </member><membercontribution>: Is that a 1906 Return? Was it the one Mr. Ginnell moved for?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02783"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member><membercontribution>: I do not know. It is a Return of 1907, and is numbered Cd. 3570. Of these 1,752 persons so approached 579 failed to reply; 265 refused to sell; 156 stated that they were themselves about to institute proceedings for sale; 273 replied that their land was worked by themselves, and in the case of 120 correspondence was still pending; 260 intimated their willingness to sell, and of these only 147 had furnished particulars of the land. In forty-one of those 147 cases an estimated price had been given to the owners, who had, in ten cases, comprising an area of 4,846 acres, replied that they were willing to sell at the estimated price, and formal proceedings for sale had been begun. In nine cases refusals were received, and replies were being awaited from the remaining twenty-two. That was untenanted land that was required for these particular purposes. It is true that the Estates Commissioners had at that time pro-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0471"/>
<col>929</col>
ceedings pending on no less than 80,000 acres of untenanted land which they required for the enlargement of small holdings and turning them into economic holdings, and which were situated in the immediate neighbourhood of the land. Those figures are not, I think, very hopeful, and they certainly do tend to show that in a considerable majority of cases application on the part of the Estates Commissioners either meets with no reply or with a direct refusal.<lb/>
As we are considering this whole question it is important to note the next clause, Clause 42, which was inserted in another place and which gives a very real safeguard to those whose land may be taken compulsorily. It is founded on the analogy of what takes place under the Lands Clauses Act&#x2014;namely, that where a piece of property is required for public purposes and is taken compulsorily, the owner may, in certain circumstances, demand that the whole property should be taken. I think noble Lords will see that in this particular case of the proposed compulsory taking of land for certain purposes the safeguard is one of the highest value to landlords, not merely because it prevents the best parts being picked out of an estate, but also because, unless the whole of the property involved is of a character which suits the special purposes of the Estates Commissioners, it cannot be taken at all. The noble Marquess asked, "Is compulsion necessary? There is no doubt that the Estates Commissioners can get some kind of land. It will not be wanted, at any rate, for some years; therefore do not pass this clause now." I wonder whether that is an argument which would appeal to noble Lords opposite. If you are going to have compulsory powers some time, is it not an advantage to close the question now when you are dealing with the whole matter in a large Bill of this kind, rather than to leave the matter open&#x2014;open, if you like, to agitation, and with the admission that you must come to it someday, but that it is not necessary this year, or possibly next year, because there is some land available? I confess that argument does not appeal to me. So far as you can deal with the whole question in an Act of this kind, I believe that to be of the greatest advantage. The relief of congestion, as we have already stated, is one of the main reasons for which these powers are demanded.<lb/>
<col>930</col>
Then there is the case of what I ventured to call the "cantankerous landlord," whom the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, described, I think, as a landlord who refused out of "pure cussedness." The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, said you must not be surprised at a man refusing if you want to take his land for nothing. That, no doubt, is perfectly true. But will he deny that there exists a considerable number of persons who have announced that they will not sell at any price? And on this question of the occasional need for compulsory purchase I should like to ask the noble Marquess a question. He is very fond of putting questions himself, and I will ask him one. What about the views of those members of Parliament who represent that part of Ireland with which he is most connected? Is it not the fact&#x2014;certainly there is a majority, there may be one or two exceptions&#x2014;that the Unionist Ulster members have either definitely declared in favour of compulsory purchase in certain cases in Ulster or have refused to declare against it? I think this can be supported by the statements of several gentlemen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02784"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member><membercontribution>: I do not think that the Ulster members have stated that they would object to compulsion if it were taken on perfectly fair terms, but they have always declared that it must be equally fair between the two parties. Take Lord Ashbourne's Act. I and others sold under that Act and we were satisfied with our bargain. They have always felt that if this satisfactory state of affairs could go on as it has been doing they would be very glad to see it extended.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02785"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member><membercontribution>: Yes; but I think the Committee will see that there is a very marked distinction between saying that you will not have compulsory purchase at all, and saying you will have compulsory purchase if the price is a reasonable one. We all wish the price to be a reasonable one, and we do not wish any one to be bought out at an unfair price. That seems to give away the whole case against the principle of compulsion, whatever may be said about its application in particular instances. What we feel is that unless this power of compulsion is given outside the congested districts as well as inside&#x2014;and I pass by that question, which is, of course, a different one&#x2014;you will run the risk, which I am quite sure your Lordships do not wish to run, of keeping the whole question of the transfer of land
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0472"/>
<col>931</col>
from landlord to tenant&#x2014;a process which has gone on too slowly and which we hope to accelerate&#x2014;open without seeing any finality before you. I confess I cannot understand, for the reasons that I have given, how noble Lords can suppose that the admittedly wide powers given in the Bill as it stands for compulsory purchase can be misused, because I cannot see to whose interest it is to do so. What have the Estates Commissioners to gain by compulsorily acquiring large tracts of land? In those circumstances we consider that the Bill as it stands, from the inherent circumstances of the case offers a complete safeguard to those whose land it is proposed to take.<lb/>
But if noble Lords opposite, admitting the possible necessity of compulsion in certain instances, desire to narrow the terms of the Bill, I think we are entitled to ask how far they would be prepared to go. I do not press noble Lords to give me words to-day. But, assuming that the general lines are that, on the one hand, compulsion outside the congested districts may be needed for the relief of congestion and may be needed in the case of an unreasonable landlord, I should be glad to know how far noble Lords think it possible to go in that direction, and whether they consider it possible that some words might be found dealing with those two subjects which would enable us to agree on this question of compulsion outside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02786"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said he was sure every member of the House must be grateful to the noble Earl for endeavouring to make good to some extent the very wide principle laid down in the clause now under discussion, but he confessed he was hardly prepared for the closing words of the noble Earl's speech. It seemed to indicate that in reality the remedy which he proposed was immensely in excess of the disease, and that something far less would do, not merely to carry out the principle of the Government but might even be acceptable to the Government themselves. They had had reproaches addressed to them by the Lord Chancellor that they had attacked in this Bill what nobody sought to defend&#x2014;the compulsory clauses of the Bill. Those reproaches would be justified if when they attacked those very wide, far-reaching, and objectionable provisions they could have shown to them from the opposite Bench that there was real necessity for their being put in force.
<col>932</col>
It had been the custom in past Bills to prove some wide spread need which could only be met by an interference with individual liberty and with the general protection of property. But they had not had that here. They had been told that a cantankerous landlord might here and there exist. The actual facts were not even given of the immense amount of land already unused and in the hands of those who desired to sell it. The noble Earl had given them a few quotations from the Estates Commissioners' Report, and he would like to point out the real difference between noble Lords sitting with him and the Government on this question. If they rejected this clause they by no means made it impossible for the Government to deal with a congested area. With the very limited means at the disposal of the Congested Districts Board for effecting improvements that body had been compelled to restrict their purchases. The estates purchased from 1904 to 1905 amounted to &#x00A3;650,000; from 1905 to 1906, &#x00A3;346,000; and from 1906 to 1907, &#x00A3;108,000. It was perfectly clear that the Congested Districts Board regarded it as having been possible for them to have worked in the later years very much up to the standard of former years, but they had been stopped from causes not within the control of members on the Opposition side of their Lordships' House, because members opposite had had the control of the purse. Then they were told in the closing sentences of the noble Earl's speech that one of the main objects of this Bill had been the relief of congestion, and the noble Earl appealed to them to put in force powers entirely outside the congested districts which had not been fully used in the present congested districts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02787">He submitted there was nothing to prove that the land could not be obtained without resort to the extreme measure of compulsion. He suggested this both on the ground of equity and on the ground of policy. He did not wish to say anything which reflected on the Congested Districts Board, which, he thought, had done admirable work in many respects; but the fact remained that it was not in accordance with public policy that there should be set up a public body which should be the largest holders of stock in the West of Ireland, that they should dominate all affairs, that the smaller class of occupiers should be practically dependent on the operations of a public Department as to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0473"/>
<col>933</col>
the prices they got or as to the market being glutted at a particular moment. The system of compulsion proposed was one which could only be justified on the ground of congestion, and it was one which no other country in the world had ever applied generally. It would have been far better to employ the Estates Commissioners in making arrangements between landlords and tenants, which could be carried through with success before a fresh Bill was brought in to make up for the deficiencies in this Bill. What they felt was that, admitting the general desire of the Government to act with perfect moderation in this matter, this Bill had been justified in another place by speeches which could not form a counterpart to the noble Earl's arguments. Speeches had been made saying that every landlord in Ireland would be bound to sell his property; but now it was suggested that it would only mean that the absentees or the cranks, or, as someone put it, "the soured spinsters of middle age," who failed to come to terms as they should do with their tenants or a public Department who would be dealt with. He felt that there was the greatest possible force in what was said on the previous night. By breaking up the larger grass farms they were removing the very class which in the interest of Ireland they should retain. The Government refused to use coercion in regard to crime, but did not mind using it in regard to landlords. This clause and the clause which followed it contained in themselves the essence of a coercionist and a landgrabbing policy&#x2014;a policy of grabbing land which, as Lord Curzon said the other night, could only have the effect of substituting a number of evicted tenants for a number of evicted landlords. For these reasons he urged the Government to reconsider the necessity of general compulsory purchase, whatever might be said about compulsion within the congested districts. He submitted that the necessity for general compulsion throughout Ireland did not exist, and if it were imposed it could only have the effect of complicating the present system and burdening the Estates Commissioners with work which it would be impossible for them to perform.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02788"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said he thought the time had now come to deal with compulsion outside congested districts. The noble Earl had said that general compulsion throughout Ireland was not likely
<col>934</col>
to occur, and that if it did the whole of the financial proposals in the Bill would fall to the ground. There was general compulsion in the Bill, and he therefore asked what became of the financial proposals. With regard to the Return from which the noble Earl had quoted&#x2014;the special Report of the Estates Commissioners up to May 31, 1907, in respect of persons applying as evicted tenants&#x2014;he did not think the question of evicted tenants was germane to any discussion on Clause 41. The noble Earl had read out figures and also statements from the owners of land which the Estates Commissioners had put down in the Report. It had nothing to do, however, with acquiring land for landless men; it was for evicted tenants. They had admitted that under the Evicted Tenants Act an evicted tenant under certain conditions could go back to his holding or to another holding if possible. The Estates Commissioners had said that it would be seen that the net result of approaching owners under Regulation 5 had been that they had intimated their willingness to sell at the estimated price in ten cases, but that it should be stated that the staff recently sanctioned in respect to those inquiries had not yet been long enough at work to inspect and make preliminary estimates of the prices of the whole of the lands which the owners had offered for inspection. That was entirely a question of evicted tenants. He protested that such a Return should have been quoted and that they should have been made to believe that it was a question of obtaining land outside the congested districts by compulsory means. He felt that he had been misled, and some of their Lordships as well, with regard to that Return, and he hoped in future if the noble Earl was going to quote from Returns that he would give the headings of them and state exactly what the Return was about.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02790"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> wished to make it absolutely clear, so far
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0474"/>
<col>935</col>
as he was concerned, that his objection to compulsion was just as great in regard to the congested districts as to those outside. The noble Earl had asked what the Estates Commissioners gained by acquiring land compulsorily. The answer was a simple one&#x2014;they gained in so far as they acquired at a much lower price. On the Second Reading he called attention to the fact that where they had been able to acquire land compulsorily under the Evicted Tenants Acts they had acquired it at about twelve years' purchase. The noble Earl further pointed out that there was a great advantage to landowners under paragraph (<i>b</i>), by which they were enabled to call on the Estates Commissioners to purchase the whole of their land. What that meant was that if the Estates Commissioners offered them half the value for a portion of their land, they might call upon them to buy the whole of it on absolutely similar terms. Then the noble Earl told them it was better that the Irish question should be settled at once. Did any one of their Lordships believe that this Bill was going to settle the whole Irish land question? Their Lordships had been assured that this question was going to be settled every time an Irish Land Bill was introduced in their Lordships' House. When dealing with the question of landless men the noble Earl told them the previous night that it did not follow because there were landless men that they were going to remain either wifeless or childless. He would not be at all astonished if in the course of a few years the Government did not want to acquire by compulsion portions of the mansion houses in Ireland, of course on fair terms, to furnish tenement houses for the landless men and their wives and children on the ground that in consequence of the loss imposed on owners by the State they did not require such big houses.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02791"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member><membercontribution>: I gather from the noble Earl opposite that he desires that the Division, which I presume we shall take on this clause, should be really as to the expediency of compulsion outside the congested areas.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02793"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member><membercontribution>: The clause itself does not contain a single reference to compulsion, but I think it is quite true to say that the concluding part of
<col>936</col>
the clause really has no meaning unless you assume that compulsion lies behind it. Therefore I will take it that we are now discussing the question of compulsion outside the congested areas. I desire to repeat that I for one entertain the strongest objection to compulsion of this kind outside the congested areas. In my view compulsion can only be contemplated for the limited purpose or relieving acute congestion and for the purpose of dealing with lands immediately adjacent to those areas in which acute congestion prevails. The noble Earl said that there was sporadic congestion beyond the limits of the congested districts. That may be so, but that does not seem to me to be a reason for extending to the whole of Ireland the extremely wide powers which you seek to obtain ostensibly for the purpose of relieving the congested districts. I also feel very strongly that in the interests of the Estates Commissioners it is most undesirable that this great, and, as I conceive, overwhelming burden should be laid upon their shoulders. It is quite clear that if this Bill passes into law in a form which admits of the application of compulsion all over Ireland the Commissioners will find themselves unable to deal with the great mass of applications which they are certain to receive. I think much importance should also be attached to the argument used last evening by Lord MacDonnell when he was dealing with this subject, an argument which went to show that financially the results of general compulsion would be of a kind which the framers of this Bill would not be likely to contemplate with any satisfaction. Therefore, my Lords, I am ready to contemplate compulsion only in regard to very narrowly restricted areas, and only if you are able to show conclusively that, without compulsion, you are not able to deal adequately with the relief of congestion inside those areas.<lb/>
We have had an attempt to establish a case for restricted compulsion of this kind. I cannot say that it seemed to me a very conclusive one. We have had the story of the 1,752 landowners who were approached&#x2014;I think approached was the word used&#x2014;in order to ascertain whether they were willing to sell their lands. I cannot believe that if you desired, to obtain land for this purpose these wholesale applications to a large body of landlords all over the country was the proper way
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0475"/>
<col>937</col>
of setting to work. I think the same may be said of the famous circular, which did, I admit, receive rather scant attention at the hands of the persons to whom it was addressed; but there is a good deal to be said, I think, in defence of their conduct. At the time that circular was issued it was a matter of notoriety that the Estates Commissioners had no funds available with which to pay for the land which they were acquiring, and people had been obliged to stand out of their money even where the transactions had gone through. It is worth remembering in connection with the affair of the circular that by means of private negotiation an offer was procured, I am told, of no less than 12,000 acres within the areas which the Commissioners themselves had indicated as being suitable for their purpose, and that when that offer had been obtained by great exercise of diplomacy it was refused by the Commissioners on the ground that they had no money available for such a purpose. Therefore I do not think that the failure of the circular or the failure of the attempt to deal with the 1,752 landowners, is by any means conclusive as proof that the attitude of the whole of the landowners or of these landowners who own land which would be suitable for the relief of congestion is an attitude of unmitigated obstruction.<lb/>
The noble Earl during the course of his speech made us a kind of a challenge across the Table. I understood him to say something of this sort, If you object to the kind of compulsion which we contemplate in this Bill, and if you yourselves do not entirely exclude from your calculations the possibility of some kind of compulsion in exceptional cases, why do you not put before the Committee in precise language the sort of proposal that you would be ready to support?" I went very near making a suggestion of that kind in the speech I made on the Second Reading of this Bill, and I cannot help thinking that if His Majesty's Government really mean business about this, if they really see that full-blown compulsion of the kind which we now find in this Bill is not desirable and ought not to be pressed upon Parliament, it is rather for them than for us to clothe in words their ideas as to that more restricted scheme which they apparently have in their minds and which we infer they would not be very reluctant to accept. There-
<col>938</col>
fore, I think we must leave it to His Majesty's Government to tell us whether they are prepared to substitute some other scheme for that which the Bill contains, and if so, what kind of scheme it is they desire to advocate. At the risk of repetition I say again that if His Majesty's Government are able to show us that it is impossible to deal with those areas in which congestion of the acutest kind is to be found without, as a last resort, using compulsion in cases where the refusal of the owner is of a perverse or of an obstructive kind; if they are able to show us that they could provide machinery which would enable that owner to satisfy the Court that his refusal was a reasonable refusal; and if, above all, they could suggest some competent tribunal entirely unconnected with the management and the administration of these Departments before which an owner could go if necessary and lay his objections, and if such a tribunal could be entrusted with the task of dealing with the question of compensation, then I would go as far as to say that although I remain strongly of opinion that the resort to general compulsion for the whole of Ireland is to my mind out of the question I should be perfectly ready to discuss with noble Lords opposite and to consider with an open mind a more moderate scheme of the kind which I have ventured to indicate to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02794"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said that although he had no property in congested districts yet he lived at no great distance from them and in a county which the Bill proposed to include in the congested districts area. So sharp a line had been drawn lately between the congested area and the remainder of Ireland that he wished to associate himself with what had been said by his noble friend on his left, and to say that he and a great many other noble Lords in that part of Ireland were as strongly opposed to compulsion being exercised in the congested districts area as they were to its exercise outside. They did not believe that compulsion was any more necessary for the relief of congestion there than in the rest of Ireland where they were told that there were sporadic areas of congestion. He would ask His Majesty's Government to be prepared, in urging the necessity of compulsion, to point out instances, especially in connection with migration, in which they could prove that any large number, or any number, of the

inhabitants of congested districts&#x2014;he strongly objected to call them "congests," for as a humorous friend of his had said, "If a man is suffering from indigestion you do not call him an indigest"&#x2014;were prepared to move supposing they had the land available for them, and that the contemplated schemes of migration, as well as of increasing small holdings, had failed from the want of additional land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02795"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR </member><membercontribution>: I desire to say a few words upon this subject. In the first place may I refer to the observations of the noble Earl, Lord Mayo, about the Report. The fact is in regard to that Report that it related to inquiries made by the Estates Commissioners for the purpose of acquiring untenanted land for their own purposes generally, and the refusals were refusals not applicable specially to the case of evicted tenants but were refusals to inquiries made of that general character. I think my noble friend the Leader of the House was perfectly entitled to use that as evidence of the fact that a large number of landlords were not willing to sell or dispose of their lands for those general purposes. I have very little to add, in fact nothing to add, to what was said by my noble friend the Leader of the House in regard to the general policy of compulsion as to places outside the congested districts. He stated&#x2014;as indeed he stated before, and so did I&#x2014;that our objects are the relief of congestion in exceptional cases, such as were described by the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, as cases of cussedness and by other noble Lords as cases of cantankerous landlords, where it was desired in the public interest to acquire their properties. The present latitude of expression allowed in Acts of Parliament, from the consideration of which I am a frequent sufferer, has not yet reached the stage at which we can use either the word "cussedness" or the word "cantankerous." The use of such language is comparatively recent, and although very useful in our debates it has not yet crept into the Statutes. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, and the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, said, "Why do not the Government define this themselves?" I do not want to fence on any advantage ground in this matter, and I will tell your Lordships why. We have found it difficult to define the very thoughts which I have been putting into words in the last minute or so. We find
<col>940</col>
definition very difficult to limit exactly according to the thoughts and the ideas and the purposes that we have, and therefore we ourselves have preferred to use general language knowing that the Estates Commissioners will be limited, in the first place, by their own necessities, because there cannot be, and will not be, money to use on any considerable scale. In the second place, the policy of the Government, and I should think of all Governments, must necessarily be not to strangle a voluntary system by putting into competition with it a compulsory system. I believe it would be ruinous to any voluntary system if any such competition were permitted. Therefore we say to noble Lords opposite that we would make no objection if they could succeed in proposing words defining the purposes for which and the occasions on which these compulsory powers should be used. The noble Marquess prefers that we should do it ourselves. He indicated his own line and the conditions, which are somewhat complex, under which he would be prepared to consent to compulsion&#x2014;that it must be for the relief of congestion, and then he said of acute congestion, and I think he ended by saying the acutest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02796"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member><membercontribution>: I do not remember the superlative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02797"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR </member><membercontribution>: I think it started with the positive, then the comparative, and ended with the superlative.

We would prefer noble Lords to put down their own Amendments and we will endeavour to meet them if we possibly can.</membercontribution></p>

of the principle of compulsory purchase, at any rate outside the congested districts. But I think it is fair to point out, before we take leave of it, that it was inserted in order to meet the objections made in another place by the friend of noble Lords opposite, and that it represents a real and effective safeguard against anything that could be considered harsh or unfair dealing in particular cases where compulsory purchase might be applied. I think it is due to ourselves to mention this, although I understand that the general principle of conpulsory purchase is to go by the board, at any rate for the time, in pursuance of the Division which we took part in just now.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02816"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD,</member> who had on the Paper Amendments restricting the application of the clause to any congested estate or untenanted land not situated in a congested districts county, but required by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion, said that in view of the decision their Lordships had come to by such a great majority the evening before on the Amendment of Lord Oranmore and Browne to replace the words which the Bill proposed to cut out of Section 6 of the Act of 1903, he felt it his duty to seriously consider what his position was in regard to the Amendment to which he now desired to speak. The retention of the words in Section 6 led practically to the frustration, on the one hand, of every attempt to relieve congestion, and the certainty, on the other hand, that attempts would be made to obtain by way of advances more than the property was security for, and in that way to lead to the failure to pay the instalments and repudiation on the part of tenant purchasers. Having that in his mind, he had come to the conclusion that their Lordships would not be able to differentiate between compulsion in regard to congestion generally
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0479"/>
<col>945</col>
and compulsion in regard to the wider issues which the noble Earl who led the Government had raised, and that it would be better for him at this stage not to move the Amendments standing in his name, but later on in connection with congestion to put his proposals forward in another form. He was greatly cheered by the statement of the noble Marquess who led the Opposition that he would consider proposals for compulsion in regard to the relief of congestion if they were put forward in a more limited manner. It would be for the Government to formulate their proposals, but subject to anything which the Government might propose he would put on the Notice Paper an Amendment limiting the compulsory acquisition of congested estates to the scheduled districts, and the compulsory acquisition of untenanted land for the relief of congestion to such land as was situated in the five administrative counties of Connaught, in the West Riding of Cork, and in the scheduled districts of Donegal and Kerry. He would exclude from compulsory acquisition all land which was subject to a land purchase annuity, and all land which within the meaning of the Evicted Tenants Act fell within the definition of demesne or home farms. A definition of that description might do a great deal to relieve congestion in the West, though it would not do all that was necessary.

The part of the Bill, then under discussion dealt with congested districts almost entirely, and in moving his Amendment that the provisions should still remain in force he thought it advisable to outline briefly the scheme for the congested districts proposed by the Government in the Bill and the one he had the honour to propose, in regard to which he believed he could count upon a good measure of support from noble Lords on his side of the House. The scheme of the Government with regard to the question before them had received he thought he could fairly say more criticism than, or at any rate as much criticism as, any other part of the Bill. Their Lordships would remember the manner in which Lord Curzon had dealt with that portion of the Bill. He (Lord Leitrim) did not desire to go into the different points at any great length. To begin with, the old Congested Districts Board after many years of good work had been entirely swept away in spite of the fact that the Government could not find any particular fault with the operations of the Board. In fact, Mr. Birrell himself admitted that he did not think there was a more popular Board in Ireland&#x2014;</p>

As regards this particular point, subsection (3) of Section 34 of the Act of 1891 is considered unnecessary now because the Board being a body corporate acts with its official seal, and it is not necessary for that purpose to say that acts must be done by a certain number of those composing the Board. As the noble Earl, I am sure, will be aware, it has nothing to do with the number of members who ought to be present for the transaction of business, but simply the number of members whose consent, as the Board exists at present, is required to give sanction to its conclusions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02833"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said the position was that his noble friend who had proposed this Amendment had a certain view, in which he himself concurred, as to what was the right thing to be done with the Congested Districts Board, and the omission of these words would fit in with the view which was practically to leave the Congested Districts Board as it stood subject to the alteration in Clause 44. He felt the inconvenience that the noble Earl opposite had indicated, that it was a
<col>948</col>
little premature to hang the whole discussion on the proposal for the omission of these words. He therefore hoped his, noble friend would be satisfied to let it stand over until the next stage of the Bill. It would be better to have the discussion on a broader clause, and he saw no objection, if his noble friend thought it right, to withdrawing the Amendment and bringing it up again later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02834">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02835"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> moved to leave out Clause 44, which incorporates the Congested Districts Board, for the purpose, as he explained, of deleting the whole of Part III, comprising Clauses 44 to 63 inclusive, and of substituting an alternative scheme which was embodied in the seven new clauses set out on the Amendment Paper. He said that if he thought it was possible to preserve the present Congested Districts Board, with its existing <i>personnel</i>, to continue its good work through the agencies and in the spirit in which it had effected so much, he would not move his Amendment. He did not think that was possible, but he was open to conviction on the point It had been said that the Congested Districts Board had done well, and he believed that to be absolutely true, but the reward it had received for its good actions from the Government was the proposal to annihilate it, to disperse it and to continue it only in name. Its successors would have no right whatever to the worthy reputation that Board had gained and deserved for its. beneficent and excellent work</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02836">His first task was to show that the present scheme was defective and ought to be rejected, and, secondly, that the alternative he proposed was the better one. Those things were entirely separate. He had no desire to recriminate, and he did not refer to the matters to which he would have to allude, for the purpose of making any charge against the Government. He did it for a wholly different purpose. He thought when they were about to create a body to operate in a particular district it was childish not to consider the <i>personnel</i> of that body, the views and opinions which they must represent, the passions they would have to deal with, the hopes they would inspire, and the physical condition of the country in which they would have to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0481"/>
<col>949</col>
operate. His charge against the scheme of the Bill was, first of all, that it gave to a Board which was exterior to the Government of the day and independent of any authority compulsory powers for the acquisition of land which it might exercise without any authority beyond its own sanction. He challenged the noble Earl the Leader of the House to find an instance in any quarter of the British Empire where a body outside and independent of the Government of the day could, without the sanction of any authority exterior to itself, exercise compulsory powers of acquiring land. With some confidence he said that such a thing did not exist. In England the authority of Parliament must be got directly by Act or Provisional Order. In an Act such as the Small Holdings Act the county councils had to get the authority of the Minister for Agriculture, and in the case of the Housing of the Working Classes Act local authorities had to get the approval of the Local Government Board. There was no instance which he knew of where any body outside and independent of the Government of the day could of its own motion exercise compulsory powers of acquiring land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02837">His most serious charge against the scheme in the Bill was that under cover of relieving congestion they were setting up a machinery which, having regard to the people who were to work it, to the expectations that had been formed of it, and to the passions that animated the people concerned, was nothing but a machinery which would, in the main, be applied to dividing the unoccupied land of Ireland among the landless men. He thought the Bill was a United Irish League Bill. It was a cattle-drivers' Bill. He had good authority, so far as the public prints warranted it, for that statement. Mr. Redmond on December 13 last was reported in the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> to have said that before he left the House of Commons Mr. Dillon told him to go to a certain district in Ireland where there was a brave people and explain the Land Bill&#x2014;that was Mr. Birrell's&#x2014;and tell them from him that the bill was framed by the Government on the lines laid down by the Irish Party. Again in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> there was a statement to the effect that every wise thing in Mr. Birrell's Bill was a plagiarism from the programme of the Irish Party and the United Irish League, and so far as it was a satisfactory measure it was a Bill of the Irish Party and of the cattle-drivers. He would take again Mr.
<col>950</col>
Sheehy, a Nationalist member of the other House, who said in December last in Meath, that he advised the cattle-drivers to put up their swords pending the Bill which Mr. Birrell had introduced and to give Mr. Birrell a chance, and no matter how much they were provoked not to resume cattle-driving until they saw what was going to happen. Whether that was accurately reported or not, it would be believed in the congested districts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02838">But he had a much better authority than that&#x2014;that of Mr. John Fitzgibbon, a most able man in the West of Ireland who occupied a remarkable position. The position Mr. Fitzgibbon assumed before the Dudley Commission was a very important one. He said he went there as the representative of the United Irish League to give evidence on behalf of the League and to express the opinion and policy of the League; he added that he had consulted the leaders of the Irish Party in London and they approved of what he had said, and that he would continue to give evidence on behalf of the United Irish League. He (Lord Atkinson) knew some of the operations of the United Irish League, and he had no hesitation in saying again what he had said before, that it was an organisation the most marvellously arranged and effective that ever was set on foot or that he had ever heard of or read of. The United Irish League could enforce its. decrees and could direct and shape the policy of the country, and it was absolutely vain to hope or think that anybody in the peasantry of Ireland, in the remote districts especially, certainly not the wretched and feeble congests as they were called, could permanently oppose the policy of the League. Therefore it became important to see what was the policy of the League because the proposal was to have elected representatives on the Congested Districts Board. What was the policy of the League? Mr. John Fitzgibbon was reported at a meeting at Roscommon to have said, after explaining the Bill in detail, that all Connaught and other counties would be under the Congested Districts Board, and the people of those counties would have the power to select their representatives on the Board. He added that the Government had been forced to introduce the Bill by the action of the people who drove cattle, and that his advice to the cattle-drivers was that as the Government were about to bring in a Bill they had better stop cattle-driving and give the Government a chance. They had, he said.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0482"/>
<col>951</col>
got their Bill now; it was before them. In another speech Mr. Fitzgibbon said&#x2014;
<quote>"The new Congested Districts Board will have upon it one member elected by each county council, who will know how to look after the people of his own county. There is no need of saying that the people of one parish must get all the land that is in that parish."</quote>
The truth was that, by this popular agitation, Mr. Davitt's well-known phrase, "The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland" had been transformed into "The land of every district for the people of that district, and for none other." Mr. Fitzgibbon believed, no doubt, what he, a member and spokesman of the League, laid down in his evidence before the Dudley Commission. In his evidence he took a prandial or culinary illustration, and said&#x2014;
<quote>"This is the joint, and this is the way I propose to carve it."</quote>
He proposed to carve the joint in the following way. First of all he said that the needs of the local congests should be provided for. He was pressed again and again and he was obliged to admit, on Page 184, Question 26,240, that the sons of the tenants were to be preferred before the migrants. That was the policy of the League as Mr. Fitzgibbon, their exponent, laid it down. He (Lord Atkinson) would not like to be misunderstood; he had nothing whatever to say against the sons of the tenants. He admired his countrymen and so far from attributing to them a double dose of original sin he did not think they had half a dose. They had many virtues, but perhaps their greatest defect was a want of moral courage; they were the strangest mixture of physical courage and moral cowardice that he had come across. But outside agrarian crime and crimes that arose from intemperance he believed the Irish people to be the most law-abiding and quiet people that inhabited any part of the Empire. He would have no objection to Mr. Fitzgibbon's policy if it was a matter of colonising the people. But that was not what it was. It was a question of choice, "Whom do you prefer?" Do you prefer the migrant or do you prefer the son of the local tenant?" They could not have both, and the distinctive policy of the United Irish League was a policy of preference for the sons of tenants as against the migrants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02839">The most extraordinary conclusion any human being could arrive at was the one arrived at by the Dudley Commission.
<col>952</col>
They dwelt at length upon the selfish aversion of the people in the district to the arrival of the migrant, and having seen how extraordinarily difficult it was to overcome that aversion one of the Commissioners suggested that four agencies should be summoned to their aid for that purpose&#x2014;first, the Press, then the local Members of Parliament, next the priests, and last of all, the greatest lay behind, the police. After saying that all those agencies would be required to overcome the selfish aversion to the migrant, the Commission came to the topsy-turvy conclusion that the majority of the members of the Board should be elected from that very district to represent the antipathy that could not be overcome. He had no aversion to popular government unless the members elected represented opinions and desires and passions and intentions that were opposed and destructive to the very object which they were elected to carry out. Mr. Fitzgibbon he took to be a good specimen of the kind of man who would be most certainly returned at an election. Let them place the elective members in power and the very first thing they would say was that there was such turmoil and tumult that it was advantageous for the district that the helpless congest should be passed by for the moment and the sons of local agriculturists should be provided for. Whatever might be the intention of the Government, the intention of those who inspired them would be to leave the congests where they were and to divide the land among the landless men. That was a merciless and a most disastrous policy. Lord Granard had told them that the Board could do nothing, and it was really under the control of the Administrative Committee. If that was the meaning of the Bill, the whole thing was a mockery. He thought the real meaning was that the Administrative Committee was to have financial control in the respect that they were to keep the accounts and see how they stood financially, but the question of what land should be bought and what should be given for it and to whom it should be given if acquired rested entirely with the Congested Districts Board. For that reason he submitted that the machinery set up would enable the Board of the future to carry out over one-third of Ireland what was the policy of the League and the policy of the cattle-drivers&#x2014;namely, that the unoccupied land should be divided among the landless men and that the claims of the congests should be passed over.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0483"/>
<col>953</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02840">He had drawn up his proposal very much on the lines of Lord MacDonnell's Memorandum. The effect of his Amendment would be to divide the duties of the Congested Districts Board between the Land Commission and the Board of Agriculture and to turn the Congested Districts Board into an advisory body to the two authorities to which its powers were transferred; and in order that there might be no suggestion that the Board was acting as it were in the air and had no means of informing itself of what local opinion was, he had adopted a machinery by which the members coming from congested district counties should be admitted <i>ex officio</i> members of the Board. The Board would be turned into a consultative body and would advise the two bodies to whom the respective duties were transferred as to the way in which those duties were to be carried out. The objection which had been urged against the Board was that it came into competition as a purchaser of land with the Estates Commissioners. Of course, that could easily be got over. He got over it in his Amendment by transferring to the Estates Commissioners the duty with regard to the purchase and the sale of land. Although he thought this was the best method he was not so attached to his own plan that he was not quite willing to support any other method proposed which would effect substantially the same results. The only qualification he made was that as he disbelieved, in election for such a purpose as the one under discussion he disbelieved in nomination also at the present time. He would oppose to the utmost any plan that in the end would have the effect of placing in power, by nomination or otherwise, a number of men who he believed would carry out, and would rejoice in the opportunity to carry out, the policy of the United Irish League, which, as he had said, was to divide up the unoccupied land of Ireland among the landless men in preference to the congests.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02843"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said he heard with unfeigned satisfaction the adherence which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, had given to the first of those schemes for reorganising the Congested Districts Board which he had the honour to submit in connection with the
<col>956</col>
Report of the Dudley Commission. He admired the ability of the noble and learned Lord's exposition&#x2014;an ability which he could not himself attempt to rival; and he was glad that it had fallen to the noble and learned Lord to explain the principles of the scheme. But he would have had greater pleasure had the exposition of the scheme not been united with a depreciation of his countrymen. Since his return from India it had been his unpleasant experience to find that the depreciation of Irishmen came far more from fellow Irishmen than from others. From Englishmen, Scotsmen, and Welshmen he had always heard a generous appreciation of Irish character. Never before had he heard it said that physical courage was united in the Irish character with moral cowardice. He was sorry to have heard it from the noble and learned Lord because it had lessened his admiration for a speech which otherwise appealed to his intelligence and his feeling.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02844">There was one part of Lord Atkinson's speech which gave him particular satisfaction, and that was the confidence which the noble and learned Lord reposed in the Estates Commissioners. It was not many hours since the noble and learned Lord had made the welkin ring with his denunciation of the Estates Commissioners. He felt that under that denunciation there must be some portion of respect for a body of men who, under the most trying circumstances in Ireland, performed their duties with great success. He believed that after all the noble and learned Lord did preserve in some corner of his heart a respect for the men who, notwithstanding difficulties of a remarkable character, had managed to pursue the even tenor of their way and hold evenly the scales of justice. The noble and learned Lord's exposition of the scheme seemed to him to dwell more than he thought was necessary on its political aspects. If he himself were called upon to defend the scheme he should prefer to defend it on its suitability for the work which had to be done in Ireland, but circumstances were now such that, although he agreed with the noble and learned Lord in thinking that if the scheme could be introduced it might be a long way the best, he felt that the circumstances of the time were not suitable for its introduction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02845">There was in Ireland a strong feeling&#x2014;sentimental it might be, but also, he had no doubt, founded on substantial and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0485"/>
<col>957</col>
concrete reasons&#x2014;that the Congested Districts Board should in some form or other be retained. It had done excellent work, although the work in his opinion had not been of that permanent character which the relief of congestion in Ireland required. The reason of that was that the Board was first limited in its capacity for doing work by the laws under which it acted, and next it was very greatly limited by the want of funds. The Bill which was now before their Lordships, and which, notwithstanding what happened yesterday, would still, he hoped, emerge from their Lordships' scrutiny as a valuable measure in supplement of the great Act of 1903, would enable the Estates Commissioners if properly organised to do a great work still in Ireland, and as popular opinion seemed to be entirely in favour of the maintenance of the Board he had abandoned all intention of proposing the first scheme, and he attached himself altogether to the alternative scheme proposed in his Minute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02846">One of the principal objections which Lord Atkinson mentioned to the second scheme was in connection with the appointed members. He might say that the second scheme to which he pinned his faith was a scheme of a Board composed of twelve members, four of whom would be <i>ex officio</i> members&#x2014;namely, the Chief Secretary, the Under-Secretary, the Vice-President of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, and one Estates Commissioner, taken in rotation, seven of whom would be appointed members, while the twelfth member would be a paid member whose duty it would be to carry on the work during the intervals of the Board's sittings, and generally to perform the functions of the managing-director of a commercial company. He himself had had experience of the working of the Board for nearly six years, and he was impressed with nothing more than the necessity of having such a paid member to carry on the work in the intervals of the sittings of the Board. The noble and learned Lord mistrusted the wish or the power of the Government to appoint impartial and independent men to these nominated appointments. He himself did not share that mistrust. If it were laid down, as he trusted it might be laid down, in the course of their Lordships' discussions, that the quality necessary for appointment to the Board should be the possession of an impartial mind and an
<col>958</col>
independent disposition, united with a knowledge of what was necessary for the purpose of viewing the relief of congestion as a whole and that the person appointed should not be of a nature likely to yield to local pressure, he saw no reason whatever to doubt that this Government or any Government would give effect to the will of Parliament and make the appointments in accordance with the intentions of the Legislature. He did not attribute to the present Government greater willingness to do that than he would attribute to noble Lords opposite if they were in power. He would equally confide to them without suspicion the power of making proper nominations, but he thought it would be right and proper that this or any Government that might be in authority should appoint a proper proportion of men with local knowledge, choosing those who possessed the qualifications to which he had alluded. If there were any reason or any ground for suspicion that the nominated members of the Board would not properly discharge their functions or that they would be subject to illicit and illegitimate pressure or influences, the way to meet that was by reducing the work which the Board now discharged and in which those illegitimate influences might have most effect, and by restricting the operations of the Board to those functions in which such influences would have least effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02847">From every point of view he thought it most desirable that the purchase of estates should be transferred from the Congested Districts Board to the Estates Commissioners He did not think the Congested Districts Board was a proper or an efficient body for the purchase of estates on a large scale. Of course, confiding the purchase of estates to an elected Board would be entirely out of the question. The agencies at the disposal of the Congested Districts Board could not be compared for experience or for knowledge with those of the Estates Commissioners. Besides, there was a very great inconvenience in the maintenance of two standards of price as there would be if two bodies purchasing on a large scale were called into existence. He had heard it said&#x2014;it was largely dwelt upon in the discussions of the Dudley Commission&#x2014;that it was desirable that the agency which would ultimately distribute the land should be the agency which should fix the price, inasmuch as it
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0486"/>
<col>959</col>
was, of course, desirable that there should be as little loss as possible made upon the transaction. That consideration had some weight as long as the money available to the Board for land purchase was limited in extent. Then they had to pick and choose the estate which they could buy; but that reason ceased to operate when they had the large funds which this Bill provided, and when their land purchase operations should no longer be of a spasmodic character. For that reason he thought it would be a very great improvement if the transfer of all purchase operations were effected, the Estates Commissioners doing for the Board the duty which they now so admirably did in their own sphere of operations. Nothing would be more conducive to efficient work than that the Board should be relieved of these functions, and restricted to its proper work of relieving congestion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02848">He further was strongly of opinion that all business connected with fisheries and industries should be transferred to the Department of Agriculture. At the present time the thing was almost ludicrous, if he might use the word without any depreciatory reference whatsoever to the gentlemen engaged in the work. What happened at the present time in connection with the fisheries part of the Board's work was that the gentleman who conducted the fishery work under the Department of Agriculture was a member of the Congested Districts Board, and he did there exactly what he would do if he had remained in his own Department. There was a transfer to the Congested Districts Board of work which, in his opinion, might be better done when united with the fishery work in the rest of Ireland. If it had not been for the many distinguished qualities of the gentleman who presided over the fishery work of the Congested Districts Board far more inconvenient results would have come from the present system than had manifested themselves. When the Board was first created there was no Department in Ireland entrusted either with the purchase of land or with the promotion of industries or agricultural efficiency. Since the Board came into operation the Estates Commissioners had been created and also the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. Both of those great Departments had already passed well beyond their novitiate, and he thought it was time that the division of labour which always
<col>960</col>
led to efficiency should be carried out, and that the work which these Departments were created to manage should now be entrusted to them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02849">In regard to the general question of policy to be pursued in dealing with the relief of congestion he was entirely at one with the noble and learned Lord in the order of precedence which he gave to the heads of that policy. They could not relieve congestion unless they had untenanted land wherewith to relieve it&#x2014;untenanted land to which migrants were willing to migrate and whose former holdings might then be distributed amongst the local people. Unless they bought untenanted land it went without saying that the relief of congestion merely reduced itself to the improvement of uneconomic holdings without enlarging them. That had been the work of the Congested Districts Board in the past, not due to any fault in the Board, but due to the fact that they had no funds with which to buy untenanted lands or to improve them when bought. They would not secure local goodwill unless the first thing they did was to relieve local congestion. No matter whether the uneconomic holding was over the fence or this side of the fence of the scheduled area, on all grounds the relief of congestion in that neighbourhood was desirable. It was more desirable because without relieving that congestion they would not obtain the goodwill of the people who had been looking on that untenanted land perhaps for generations in the hope of sharing in it when good times had come. Therefore he entirely agreed with the noble and learned Lord that the relief of congestion on untenanted land purchased should be the first object and aim of the Congested Districts Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02850">Next after that beyond any doubt, and with unshaken firmness, they ought to give the remaining land to the congests and not to the so-called landless men. Having satisfied so far as they could the congests whom they desired to relieve, there might be remnants of land left of which the Congested Districts Board might find it desirable to dispose. He would respectfully submit that the discretion of the Congested Districts Board in dealing with these remnants of land should not be fettered by such rules as had passed under the notice of their Lordships during the last few days, and that they should not lay down restrictions that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0487"/>
<col>961</col>
the remnants should be given to tenants holding ten-acre farms or the sons of tenants holding thirty-acre farms. They should trust the Congested Districts Board with complete discretion in that matter and allow them to dispose of the remnants of land to the best advantage of the locality, and also in order to secure the most easy working of their own Department. These were the few remarks which it occurred to him to make in recommending the second scheme which he had the honour to propose and which was in his name on the Notice Paper. He believed that that scheme would be effective in creating in the West of Ireland a spirit of confidence and of reliance in the uprightness, the impartiality, and the integrity of the Board. Short of such a Department as the first scheme contemplated he thought they could secure those most essential qualifications in no Board which admitted of the elective element, because elected members must always be subject to local pressure from their constituents. At the same time, if they did no more than appoint members who might be elected, by the mere fact of their appointment they would be free from that local pressure, or at least they would not be under the same obligation to be responsive to it. He thought that the suggestions which he had placed on the Paper were such as would best conduce to the objects which their Lordships had in view&#x2014;the speedy, economical, and efficient relief of congestion in the West of Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02851"><member>THE EARL OF LEITRIM</member> said that after the damaging attack upon the Government's proposals by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, and with which he thought Lord MacDonnell agreed to a great extent, he did not think it was necessary for him to deal with those proposals. At the outset of his remarks he should like to associate himself with the noble Lord who had last spoken in his anxiety to relieve congestion as quickly as possible. They were just as anxious in every way that these slum properties, as the noble Lord called them, and in some cases rightly so, should be dealt with as the Congested Districts Board had been dealing with them for many years past. At the same time he did not think it was right to overstate the case, as the Bill did, in including a third of Ireland in the congested area. Much had been said about the paternal system carried on by the Congested Districts Board and the other system carried on by
<col>962</col>
the Department of Agriculture which might be called the system of self-help. A few years ago the agricultural part of the Congested Districts Board's work was to a great extent handed over to the Department of Agriculture, and at the time he himself thought that the system adopted by the Department could not possibly work in the congested districts because the system was a complicated one. The tenants had to study it and they had to find out how they could help themselves. That system had been going on now for about two and a-half years, and he found he was entirely wrong. The system had worked admirably. The congested districts obtained quite as much benefit from the schemes of the Department as the uncongested portions of the county. Therefore he submitted that as a point to show that it was not a good thing to increase the area of the congested districts. The area of the congestion was gone into very fully in 1891, and after nearly twenty years of work it was rather an acknowledgment of defeat to say that now they had to increase that area to five times the valuation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02852">But to deal with the two different schemes before their Lordships, he did not think Lord Atkinson had made out a case to show why the present Congested Districts Board should not go on with the work they had so well undertaken for the last twenty years, and he thought that was agreed by both sides of the House. Their work was good in relieving congestion; they had experience of it, and were not likely to be biassed by political or sectional interests. Where was the fault? No fault had been found yet with the Congested Districts Board sufficient to justify doing away with the Board. Therefore he did not think Lord Atkinson's scheme would meet with the approval of their Lordships' House; but he wished to agree with the noble and learned Lord in one thing he said, that nominated members were just as unsatisfactory as elected members, and the scheme of the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, dealt with nominated members.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02856"><member>THE EARL OF LEITRIM</member> said he thought it was a great thing to find something in Ireland which was popular among both parties. This Board would have to a great extent to come between the parties and have judicial functions, and therefore it was most important that it should have the confidence of the country. He maintained that it had and would have the confidence of the country. The same care should be taken in appointing this Board as was being exercised in choosing the Commissioners to carry on the Development Grant. They did not introduce the elective element into that body, and therefore he maintained that they should not introduce it into the Development Grant for Ireland. He did not think that a county councillor from every county to consult as to how the money should be spent would be inclined to help hasten the work of the Development Bill, and that was their contention with regard to the elected members and the fresh nominated members of the Congested Districts Board. They agreed with what had fallen from the noble Lord, Lord MacDonell, in desiring to see the fisheries and agriculture handed over to the Department of Agriculture. Therefore, they proposed that the Congested Districts Board should remain as at present constituted, there being no good reasons shown so far why it should not continue the work it had been engaged in since 1891. Amendments would be moved dealing with the allocation of funds and also an important Amendment would be moved by Viscount Midleton dealing with the varying of the area of congestion. The area of congestion after twenty years of work might have changed. The area which was congested twenty years ago might not be congested now. He knew himself that the Congested Districts Board had been most successful in starting a large fishery wihtin the last fifteen years or so. The amount of money which the fishery brought in to a small district was some &#x00A3;40,000 a year That might be considered an uncongested district in future. They agreed that there might be districts which
<col>964</col>
should be declared congested, but they also pointed out that there might be districts which should be declared uncongested. They did not agree with Lord MacDonnell's scheme, and he regretted that they could not agree to the scheme pointed out by Lord Atkinson. Therefore he trusted their Lordships would approve of leaving matters as they were. No scheme had yet been put forward to deal with this question satisfactorily, and therefore he should hope to be supported by their Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02857"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said that if the chicken that was being plucked before being handed over to the finial master of its destiny&#x2014;namely, the cook&#x2014;had any feelings at all which he admitted was open to doubt, his (Lord Shaftesbury's) feelings would be rather akin to those of the chicken at this moment, inasmuch as he was a member of the Congested Districts Board whose future destinies were under their Lordships' consideration. He was rather diffident, therefore, in addressing their Lordships upon the subject at all, and, what was more, he did not wish to labour for a moment the proposals of the Government with regard to the Board to be set up. All the arguments against that Board had been really very forcibly dealt with in the Second Reading debate and also that night. He would only like to say in passing that he did not understand the logic&#x2014;if logic were counted as anything in these days&#x2014;of the Government's proposals inasmuch as they gave the Board with one hand all kinds of powers and of very wide reach, and yet, with the other hand, they seemed to him to take them away by the fact that in Clause 53 they gave power to the Lord-Lieutenant to direct everything by Order in Council. Therefore he did not quite see the object in bringing in the elective element upon the Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02858">But with regard to the future of the Board and with regard to the schemes that had been laid before their Lordships' House, he would, like to say one or two words. He confessed that, as he had indicated on the Second Reading of this Bill, the scheme of the noble and learned Lord appealed to him because, after all, he believed it to be the most efficient and economic way of dealing with the whole question; but there might be objections. It might be too drastic a move, and might
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0489"/>
<col>965</col>
not be quite as intelligible to the Irish people as the idea of maintaining the Board, at any rate for the present. Therefore, he must pass from the noble and learned Lord's scheme to that of Lord MacDonnell, and he believed that if that scheme could meet with their Lordships' approval it would be the best way of settling the difficulty at the present moment. From all he could gather from speeches made in and out of Parliament the present Board had attained a certain amount of popularity and approval in the work it had done, and, therefore, he might be pardoned if he saw no grave objection to retaining the Board, at any rate for the present, as it was now constituted. But he wished to qualify that statement by saying that he really saw no objection&#x2014;in fact he would almost advocate it&#x2014;to handing over the purchasing power of the Board to the Estates Commissioners, not entirely for the reasons mentioned by Lord MacDonnell, but really with the object of seeing one purchasing authority in Ireland and so removing the possibility of any competition, rivalry, or friction there might arise, and had perhaps arisen, in having two authorities purchasing land in Ireland. In that respect he would not in the least mind seeing the purchasing authority of the Board handed over to the Estates Commissioners; and so far as fisheries and industries were concerned, he thought it was the most practical thing to do. They had had no difficulty with regard to the fisheries, because, as Lord MacDonnell had pointed out, the same man who looked after the fishery department in the Department of Agriculture looked after the fisheries in the Congested Districts Board. He was the one man who had looked after all the fisheries in Ireland, and therefore there was no object in retaining the control of fisheries in the Congested Districts Board; and, so far as the industries were concerned, he believed the methods employed by the Department of Agriculture were really more beneficial to the people than those attributed to the Congested Districts Board, so that he thought if they retained the clause as it was with these provisions that might be the best solution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02859"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said that from what they had heard from Lord MacDonnell they could quite understand that some modifications might be necessary, but what he and other members of the Landowners Con-
<col>966</col>
vention were most anxious to do was to retain the Congested Districts Board in its present form without any introduction of the elective element. There was no doubt his noble and learned friend had pointed out all the objections to the scheme that appeared in the Bill, but he had substituted for these elective members members elected by the Council of Agriculture, and he wished to point out that that also contained grave dangers. At present these members of the Council of Agriculture were elected by the county councils, presumably at least because of their knowledge of agriculture and experience in technical instruction, but if these new functions of acting as members of the Congested Districts Board were to be added it was perfectly clear that in future they would be appointed as advocates of the extreme policy of the United Irish League. That would have the disadvantage of introducing politics into the Agricultural Council and placing men there who would be appointed as politicians rather than as men experienced in the matters that ought to come before them. Hitherto that body had been as free from politics as it was possible for any body in Ireland to be. They would impair that Department, and it would be extremely bad to have such advisers for the Estates Commissioners. His noble and learned friend proposed that they should be only an advisory body, but he thought the Estates Commissioners would find considerable difficulty in resisting their advice if they were appointed by Act of Parliament, especially when they had the whole country at their back. That was why he thought they would be bad advisers and would be open to the same objection as if they were elected <i>ad hoc</i> by the county councils. He would like, therefore, to leave the Congested Districts Board as it was. It had done exceedingly well. It had worked a lot of good in his own county and in the neighbourhood, and although, like all other bodies, it had made a mistake now and then, it had given great satisfaction and inspired great confidence among the people. He passed from that to the question of the duties they would have to perform in connection with compulsory purchase. As he had said when the discussion was taking place on compulsory purchase&#x2014;</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02866"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The Bill is one of unusual intricacy and the complication of our discussion has not been diminished by the complication of the Amendments on the Paper. We are, as the noble Lord rightly says, discussing the future position of the Congested Districts Board. Now may I venture to mention one or two points in regard to which I think there is a somewhat general agreement? In the first place I think all, or, at any rate, most of those noble Lords who have spoken to-night have arrived at the conclusion that some change is desirable in the duties at present assigned to the Board. It would really be almost inconceivable that we should think otherwise, because, as we all know, since the Board was first established, I think in 1891, other Departments have been created, and there is, as a result, a great deal of overlapping and sometimes of unfortunate competition between two authorities. That is the first point upon which there is some agreement. There is another point which has not been expressly referred to this evening but about which there is a considerable amount of tacit agreement. I think all noble Lords from Ireland would be in favour of the retaining for the Congested Districts Board, or, at any
<col>968</col>
rate, for the relief of the congested districts, the large sums of money which this Bill is intended to provide for that purpose. Then comes the third point upon which I think there is agreement, or, at any rate, a great preponderance of opinion. There is a wide-spread desire that the Congested Districts Board as we know it should not be wiped out of existence altogether. If I was going to criticise the proposals contained in the Bill&#x2014;which I shall not do at any length, because they have already been sufficiently dealt with&#x2014;I should dwell upon the fact that the new Congested Districts Board as it would exist under this Bill would be something wholly different from the Congested Districts Board as we know it at present. It would be a large and unwieldy body concerned with a large and unwieldy area. It would be constituted in a manner which would expose it to constant local pressure; it would dispose, without responsibility to Parliament, of very large sums of public money; and, finally, it would be calculated to stereotype and perpetuate that kind of paternal administration which we are all ready to accept as a transition from the present to a better state of things, but which we should not desire to recognise as part of the permanent institutions of the country.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, I think there is a general feeling, on this side of the House at any rate, that the scheme of the Bill, so far as it concerns the new Congested Districts Board, is not one which we can possibly accept. Let me touch for one moment on the alternatives proposed. In the first place there is the proposal of my noble and learned friend Lord Atkinson, which he unfolded to us in a speech which we all listened to with delight. I say without hesitation that if we had a clean slate and were reconstructing a new system <i>ab initio</i> for the administration of these affairs, the scheme which he favours is the kind of scheme which I should certainly be inclined to support. It is logical, it is symmetrical, it would have the effect of placing in the hands of the Department of Agriculture duties connected with agriculture and industries which properly belong to it; it would have the effect of concentrating all purchase operations in the hands of the Estates Commissioners who in my opinion are very much better qualified and equipped for the purpose of dealing with these questions than the Congested Districts Board can be; and it would leave the new Congested Districts Board in the position of a
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0491"/>
<col>969</col>
purely deliberative and advisory body. That seems to me, in theory, a most admirable proposal. But to my mind it has this defect, that the scheme also virtually puts an end to the Congested Districts Board. The Board would cease to have any administrative functions and it has always been connected in the public mind in Ireland with administrative functions wisely and beneficially performed. Therefore I am inclined to think that the proposal of my noble and learned friend, though admirable in theory, is one which, perhaps, in practice it might not be desirable to apply.<lb/>
Then there is the proposal which was sketched by my noble friend Lord Leitrim, who, I think, desires to retain the Congested Districts Board in its present position&#x2014;wherein I venture to express my agreement with him&#x2014;and to add to it a new body which would be known, I think, as the Allocation Committee. I am always a little doubtful as to the wisdom, in a country where there is a good deal of official machinery already in existence, of adding any new wheels to the official machine, but I am bound to say that it seems to me that some arrangement of this kind, under which the Congested Districts Board, the Department of Agriculture, and the Land Commission might, from time to time, come together and compare notes and decide particularly as to the distribution of the funds which will be at their disposal, would be a very sensible and admirable arrangement. Then there is the scheme, not differing very widely from that scheme but not quite identical, which I think is to be found in the Amendment of my noble friend Lord MacDonnell and which was, I think, also supported by my noble friend Lord Shaftesbury in the speech to which we have just listened. I understand that under that proposal the whole of the land purchase operations would be transferred to the Estates Commissioners, and the whole of the operations connected with agriculture, industries, and fisheries to the Department of Agriculture<lb/>
I understand it to be also suggested that although the Congested Districts Board should no longer be itself allowed to conduct land purchase operations it should be put in the position of indicating to the Land Commission what estates, what parcels of land, it might be desirable to acquire in one part of Ireland or another for the purpose of relieving congestion. That seems to me to be a very good suggestion
<col>970</col>
If it were carried out, I understand what would happen would be this. The Congested Districts Board, with the intimate knowledge of the congested areas which it would possess, would indicate to the Land Commission its desire that certain areas should be acquired. The Land Commission would thereupon acquire these areas, and, having acquired them, would transfer them to the Congested Districts Board, which would in turn improve those areas, do what was necessary in the way of equipping them with buildings, drains, and so forth, and would have the duty of distributing the land in such a manner as might be suitable among the claimants. In addition to that I understand it to be suggested that the Congested Districts Board might be reinforced by the addition of a paid member to whom would be entrusted the routine work of the Department. That, again, seems to me to be a very good suggestion. But I separate that proposal from the proposal of my noble friend Lord MacDonnell, who would, I gather, prefer gradually to get rid of the present members of the Congested Districts Board and to substitute for them a number of nominated members.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02867"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: There are eight members of the Congested Districts Board nominated at present.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02868"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I understand the proposal. But I lean rather to that which I think finds favour with my noble friend behind me, who would like, for the present at all events, to leave the Congested Districts Board alone. That alternative, if I have made myself clear, is the one which, upon the whole, seems to me to be the most promising, and if we could contrive to take our Amendments in such a way as to give the House the opportunity of deciding between the three schemes which I have mentioned I think we might perhaps advance matters a little. But I confess I do see considerable difficulties in arriving at a conclusion as between these half dozen schemes, because I believe there are half a dozen possible variations which might be gathered from the Amendments on the Paper. I have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0492"/>
<col>971</col>
thought it desirable at this stage, with great deference, to lay before the House the alternatives which lie before it and an expression of the manner in which I regard this difficult problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02869"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think your Lordships must be grateful to the noble Marquess who has just sat down for two things&#x2014;in the first place, having confined himself exclusively to the point at issue and in the second place, having, with, unequalled clearness placed the various solutions which are proposed before your Lordships' House. I think perhaps it is best first, if I may do so, to deal with the proposals of the noble and learned Lord opposite. I understand that they do not find favour with what I may call the official Opposition, if I may so express myself, but the noble and learned Lord put them forward in a speech of such great force that I think it would not be respectful to him if I were not to say a word or two about them. The noble and learned Lord proposes, in effect, to abolish the Congested Districts Board and to substitute for it an advisory body under the name of the Congested Districts Board and consisting of members of the Council of Agriculture appointed for any county containing a congested district. This would be a purely advisory body, and I think the noble Marquess who has just sat down was quite right in explaining that it would not in any sense be the Congested Districts Board as we have been accustomed to know it.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord made a challenge to me to suggest, if I could, any parallel to the proposals which we put before the House for the reconstitution of the Board and for its functions. It may be that there is no parallel to such a body within the British Empire, but then there is no parallel within the British Empire to the congested districts in the West of Ireland and special cases have, in our opinion, to be met with special remedies. The noble and learned Lord first proceeded towards the demolition of the idea of any elective element on the new Board. I do not wish to labour again the reasons which actuated us in accepting the opinion of the majority of Lord Dudley's Commission in this matter&#x2014;that is to say, I do not wish to labour again the argument which I ventured to use at an earlier stage of the discussion on the question of the provision of land for congests and landless men. But the noble Lord did go over
<col>972</col>
some of the ground again when he spoke of the aversion to migrants, which he knew to exist, and we have always said that our proposition for the admission of an elected element was largely put forward in the hope of finding some means of diminishing and dealing with that aversion. The noble and learned Lord has said that the United Irish League is entirely on the side of the landless men and opposed to the congests, and in support of that he quoted observations made by Mr. John Fitzgibbon before the Commission, and also observations made by that gentleman in a speech. Mr. Fitzgibbon's is a well-known name in Ireland. He was well known when I was Viceroy there. He is a man who undoubtedly holds strong opinions and expresses himself strongly, and he was considered to be, and was stated by the Chief Secretary in the House of Commons to be, an extreme champion of the views of the landless men as against those of congests. However, the noble and learned Lord did not quote the published correspondence which passed between Mr. Birrell and Mr. Fitzgibbon on this subject. It is merely necessary to quote a very few lines of a letter from Mr. Fitzgibbon, dated from Castlerea on the 7th of last month. In that letter Mr. Fitzgibbon said that he never made the statement attributed to him by gentlemen sitting behind the Front Opposition Bench. On the contrary, he had invariably stated that the settlement of the people in the fertile parts ought to be a national and not a parish or local question. All he did say was that in order that the difficulties of which they heard so much from tenants far apart should be met and the work of migration run smoothly, care should be taken that the occupiers of uneconomic holdings living in the vicinity of the parish in which the untenanted lands were situated should receive at least equal treatment to that given to migrants coming from a distance. That is an observation with which I think nobody would be disposed to quarrel. My purpose in stating it is because I do not understand why it should be assumed by the noble and learned Lord that the United League as a body are altogether opposed to the relief of congestion in Ireland by migration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02870"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said the witness quoted was put forward expressly to represent the policy of the League. He said, "Congests first, then sons of tenants, then migrants."</p>

It is not my business to describe, much less to defend, the policy of the League, but it seems to me that the noble and learned Lord and other noble Lords mix up two things. It is the fact that some of these young landless men who give the trouble are active members of the League, and, therefore, in a sense, it may be true that, so far as particular districts are concerned, a great number of members of the League are on the side of the landless men. But it is quite a different thing to say that the policy of the Nationalist Party as a whole is opposed to the relief of congestion by migration. I know no colour for it, and I cannot conceive any reason for it. Why and for what conceivable reason should it be the object of the Nationalist Party to maintain, in the congested districts of Ireland, a state of misery and confusion? It cannot be supposed that any political preference or prejudice should enter into the matter, and I should require a great deal more evidence than I have ever heard of the supposed preference of the Nationalist Party for the landless men before I could accept in any degree what seems to approach an article of faith with noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02874"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Might I interrupt the noble Earl? In the evidence given before the Dudley Commission, Mr. Finucane, who, of course, is anxious that migrations should take place, said that he did not shrink from the contemplation of migration and police protection, and declared that if only the grass lands were resold cheap enough you would
<col>974</col>
soon find migrants who would fight for their rights. They were to fight for their rights according to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02875"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I cannot see the smallest relevance in the observation of the noble Marquess. It has never been denied, and we have put it forward as our main difficulty, that individual migrants would find themselves in personal difficulties with individual landless men who might wish to obtain farms. But that is quite a different matter from saying that it is the settled policy on the part of the Irish Members in Parliament and the Nationalist Party generally to interfere with the relief of congestion by migration. I, for one, do not believe it. I pass for a moment to the question of what are to be the extra functions of the Estates Commissioners, without attempting to describe them, either if the Board is abolished or if the duty of land purchase is entirely taken from the Congested Districts Board. I may at once say that we regard it as of the first importance that the power of purchase should be retained by the Congested Districts Board, and we are in no way disposed to throw these duties upon the Estates Commissioners, who, in the discussion on the previous Amendment, were described as being so heavily overtaxed that they could not contemplate the trouble of acquiring even an acre of land here or there by compulsory purchase. It was supposed that it was impossible for them to look into the question as to whether a particular piece of untenanted land could he compulsorily acquired or not, because they were so hard worked. Yet it is proposed to transfer to them the whole of the functions now possessed by the Congested Districts Board in relation to the purchase of land. I leave it to noble Lords opposite to reconcile these two statements. Quite apart from any inconsistency of which noble Lords may be convicted, it is as a matter of fact the case that, if the Estates Commissioners are to be asked to take over in any degree the general functions of the Congested Districts Board, their ordinary work of regulating and assisting land purchase must suffer. We are throwing as it is a heavy burden on the Commissioners by the acceleration which we hope will proceed from the regular work of their office; and if you are going to add work connected with the congested districts, as is freely proposed, it simply means that the work will not in reality be
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0494"/>
<col>975</col>
performed by them but will have to be delegated to and done by somebody else. That is a conclusion at which your Lordships would not wish to arrive, because when important functions of this kind are entrusted to public officials of the standing and character of the Estates Commissioners you desire that they should be performed by the men themselves and not be handed over to somebody else.<lb/>
The official view opposite, as I understand, is that which, if I may say so, was most clearly set forward by the noble Earl, Lord Leitrim, in the speech with which he followed the noble and learned Lord. That view is that the Congested Districts Board should be retained in precisely its present form. I do not know if the noble Earl desired to change its functions in any way, but there have been proposals for the retention of the men but the modification to some degree of their powers and duties. It was said, and said with great truth, that in a sense the Congested Districts Board has done its work very well. Everybody knows that distinguished men have given ungrudgingly of their time and pains to the work of the Congested Districts Board, and that a great deal of that work has been of the highest value. But I shall never believe that administrative functions can be properly exercised by a body which meets once a month, sits for a couple of days, and then adjourns and does not work through committees but has to depend upon officials for its actual work of administration. That being so we hold the view that whatever happens to the Congested Districts Board, it is of the highest importance that its work should be carried on by permanent paid members. The Report of Lord Dudley's Commission suggested three such members, but we think that two would be able to do the work that is required. But we attach great importance to there being two, and that is a point on which we should be most unwilling to give way.<lb/>
The noble Lord behind me, Lord Mac-Donnell, proposes a somewhat different course. He proposes that one of the Estates Commissioners should sit on the Congested Districts Board. I can understand a certain attraction in that suggestion, but for the reasons which I have already given as to the work of the Estates Commissioners it does not seem to me wise, although I can see the advantages which
<col>976</col>
might follow from it, to attempt to throw upon any of the Estates Commissioners the additional work of being a member of the Congested Districts Board. Then the noble Lord suggests that there should be seven appointed members. Now there was one saying of the noble Earl, Lord Leitrim, which struck me as something of a dark saying. He said he disliked nominated members almost as much as he did elected members. On the same Bench as he is sitting the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, is a nominated member of the Board, who apparently we are to believe represents an almost sinister figure, as if he had actually been sent there by a county council. We should be most unwilling to think that was possible. If the body of the members are to be neither elected nor nominated what are they to be? Are they to be all <i>ex officio</i>? In that case your Board will merely be another name for a Government Department.<lb/>
I think we may assume from the course of the debate that the majority of your Lordships will not be disposed to accept the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord. It is evident from what the noble Marquess who has just sat down said that the retention of the Board in some form is desired. We think that there is a distinct and real advantage in bringing in an elected element. If there is to be any elected element at all it ought, in our opinion, to be part of the constitution of the Board, rather than of a merely advisory character. I think any objection which may be taken to the local element on the ground that they would push local interests and be biassed by local considerations would operate more seriously in the case of a purely advisory body than if people had to sit round a table and put their views as members of the body against those of other members of the body.<lb/>
We also think that, as I have already said, it is of the first importance to have two permanent paid members; as regards the remaining composition of the Board, that I think speaks for itself and does not need any particular description or justification. It is, however, right to mention, as objection has been taken to the elected element, that it is the Administrative Committee who by our proposal have the power of dealing with financial questions. I do not know that I need labour this
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0495"/>
<col>977</col>
question of the composition of the Board any further. The whole matter was so clearly stated by the noble Marquess that I think we are enabled at any rate to form our opinion of it, although it is not quite evident by what precise form of dealing with the Amendments the desire of the majority of the House may be translated into the Bill. I think it can be done. I suppose the first course would be to take a vote Aye or No on the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02887"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved an Amendment to alter the constitution of the Board. He said that at present the Board consisted of eleven members. The original Board consisted of two official and five appointed members, the appointed members being subsequently raised to eight. It then stood at ten, and by the Act of 1903 the Under-Secretary was made a member of the Board. His proposal now was that an additional member should be added. He should be a paid member, and this would make the number twelve. Of those, four members would be official, seven nominated, and one would be a paid official of the Government. That, in substance, was the proposal he had put on the Paper. There was a subsidiary proposal that one half of the existing members should vacate their office on the coming into operation of the Bill. The greater part of the nominated members had been nominated for life and some of them had been on the Board for a long series of years. Some had been re-nominated. Having had experience of the Board, his idea was that it would be a good thing to introduce some fresh blood, though he would wish to maintain such a proportion of the Board as would continue the traditions of the institution. He was not particularly wedded to one half vacating office; and if their Lordships preferred one third he had no objection. He had no great objection to the existing Board remaining in office a little longer, but it was very desirable that there should be some introduction of fresh blood. His Amendment would Make the clause read that the Board should consist of twelve members; that four of those be official&#x2014;viz., the Chief Secretary, the Under-Secretary, the Vice-President of the Department of Agriculture, and one Assistant Commissioner in rotation&#x2014;seven nominated members and one paid member. The Amendment would also provide that one half of the existing members of the Board should vacate office on the coming into effect of this Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02890"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said his reason for having only one paid member was that the two proposals transferred to the Estates Commissioners the purchase operations and transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction the fisheries and industries. Nothing then would be left to the Board except the improvement of estates bought for them and the execution of agreements with the tenants. The functions of the Board were to improve estates of which they became the owners and to re-sell those estates to the tenants after improvement. The re-sale followed the procedure imposed on an ordinary landlord. The Board came to an agreement with his tenant. The agreements were recorded and deposited with the Estates Commissioners, who then carried out the remainder of the process. For the work that would remain after the transfers of duties were effected two officers would be quite unnecessary. The work would easily be within the power of one officer of ordinary competence and industry to discharge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02891"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> regretted he could not support the amended
<col>980</col>
proposals with regard to the Congested Districts Board. He had no doubt that from an administrative point of view they would be of advantage. Coming as they did with the commendation of the noble Lord who had had experience in administering the work of the Board they demanded serious consideration; but it seemed to him that the arguments put forward by the Government for keeping the Board as it was were so strong that it did not seem to him worth while to disturb its constitution in the way suggested. There was also the fact that the Act which set up this Board expired in two years, and that would appear to be the proper time for considering any such administrative changes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02892"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> wished to make a suggestion. There was a good deal of agreement between the two sides of the House as to what functions the Board should discharge. He agreed that the purchase of land should be transferred to the Estates Commissioners and that some duties at present discharged by the Congested Districts Board should be transferred to the Department of Agriculture. Considering that the Government were opposed to the noble Lord's plan for the reconstitution of the Board and that it did not seem to find any favour either with noble Lords on the Opposition side, would it be too much to ask the noble Lord to imitate his (Lord Atkinson's) moderation. It was quite hopeless to suppose that the Amendment could be carried, and he suggested that the wiser course would be to withdraw it and endeavour between themselves to introduce some Amendment on Report which would have practical support from a sufficient number on both sides to overbear the opposition of the Government should it be offered.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02893"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that of the schemes put forward the Leader of the House preferred his (Lord MacDonnell's) next to that of the Government.

Lord MacDonnell and Lord Atkinson, and also with something of what had been said by the Leader of the House, he could not find in anything that had been said the basis of the proposal that he himself would vote for. He had a clear and plain opinion that the right course to take was to stand by the Congested Districts Board as it was. It was popular and had worked well on the whole although open to criticism in some details. He admitted that if they were starting afresh he would try to accept the lines sketched by Lord Atkinson, but they must fall in with the logic of facts. There was not a clean slate. They had an existing Board, and he was in favour of standing to that Board and standing to its area, even if, after further consideration, they felt disposed to try and modify its duties and its work.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02900"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he quite recognised that the noble Earl put the question in a fair and reasonable way; it was a most legitimate question from every point of view. If the noble Earl meant that he would only give the money if he had the representative members added he would answer him at once that he would not take the money on, those terms. The existing Congested Districts Board dealt with its work on the whole so as to command approval and had performed many useful functions well, although open to criticism,
<col>982</col>
and he hoped that would be sufficient to justify the continuance, not only of the support it had generally received in Ireland, but also of the confidence of the Government, and that the Government would not feel disposed to try and cut down the measure of pecuniary support they intended giving although the Board would not represent their exact view as to its constitution.</p>

with the general local government organisations throughout the country. They had before them on the Dudley Commission a large mass of evidence to show that there was no local touch of an official character between the Board and the people.

But it was felt desirable to connect the Congested Districts Board in an official way with the Local Government Board organisation of the country, and he believed that the Local Government Board were also of opinion that such an organisation as that was desirable for their own purposes.

But the division between the two bodies of administrative officials was such an obvious anomaly that he hoped it did not require any further arguments to commend his Amendment to the Committee. It was simply to transfer the work of aiding and developing sea fisheries in the congested districts to the same body as administered fisheries in the whole of the rest of Ireland&#x2014;namely, the Department of Agriculture.</p>

The same thing, though to a smaller extent, applies to this Amendment.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02957"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think this proposal demanded a little more explanation and defence than it has been given. Is there any parallel to be found for the handing over of a lump sum of money to be fought for by three Departments? I confess I cannot think of one The proposal seems to be rather as though the whole sum for the defence of the country were put in a pool and the Admiralty and the War Office were left to fight in a committee of equal numbers to see who would get most. With whom must rest the decision as between the Congested Districts Board, the Department of Agriculture, and the Estates Commissioners? The whole of this vast sum of money is to be thrown before them on the table and then this strange committee of nine have to decide it as best they can. I do not know what the outcome of that scramble would in most cases be. Would it be that a system of log-rolling would take place as between two Departments, one of whom would agree to support the other's claim for half the fund that was going in consideration of getting the other half and leaving, possibly, the third Department out in the cold? I confess the proposal seems to me a very singular one. I speak in all seriousness and I shall be glad to hear the opinion of noble Lords upon it, partly because I believe it to be entirely without precedent and partly because it does seem to me in essence to be thoroughly unworkable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02958"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said that although there might be no parallel for this proposal, part of the scheme was that the Estates Commissioners should be the future purchasing authority. They must look at it not in the light of the Bill but from what had been outlined that day. The first proposal was that the Estates Commissioners should be the purchasing authority. Then they came to the transfer of the duties that had been handed over, which would require money to be given, probably, to the Department taking over that work. He did not think the proposal would work adversely There might be no parallel for it, but he believed the three members of the Congested Districts Board, the three members of the Department, and the three Estates Commissioners would meet and settle the question in a most amicable way.</p>

Were they to understand that that sum was not to remain to the credit of the Board but was to be taken by the Treasury in part satisfaction of what they proposed to do under the section in regard to the flotation of loans?

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02969"><member>LORD DENMAN</member> wished to remind the Committee that the clause was copied from the Local Government Act of 1898 which regulated the Local Government Board, and which, he believed, had been found to work well. He suggested that the clause might be allowed to stand as drafted, but if the Amendment were pressed he would not oppose it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02970"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> had serious objections to the first part of the clause. If the first part of the clause went out, as he proposed it should do, the Amendment of Lord Ashbourne would also go as a matter of consequence. What would be the effect of subsection (1) of this clause? Paragraph (iii) ran that the Lord Lieutenant might make such regulations as appeared to him necessary or expedient for carrying into effort this Part of the Bill. That would bring the Congested Districts Board under the control of the Treasury. Hitherto the Board had been the only independent Board in Ireland, and because of that independence it was the most popular of Irish Boards. This proposal had the direct effect of bringing the operations of the Board under rules to be made by the Lord Lieutenant&#x2014;that was to say, made at the suggestion of the Chief Secretary he acting perhaps on the suggestion of the Treasury in all Treasury matters. That completely destroyed the independence of the Congested Districts Board. He had an Amendment on the Paper to alter subsection (1) by omitting in paragraph (i) the word "Administrative"; to make a small change in paragraph (ii) by substituting "member" for
<col>992</col>
"members"; and to amend paragraph (iii) by omitting the words "or expedient for carrying into effect this part of this Act" with a view to inserting "for the audit of accounts." The third paragraph of the first subsection of Clause 53 would then run, "Make such regulations as appear to him necessary for the audit of accounts." The effect of that would be to leave the Congested Districts Board as it was now independent of Treasury control. If that was not done all the good effects which had hitherto attended the working of the Congested Districts Board and might be expected to attend it in future would be destroyed. He begged their Lordships to take this matter into their most serious consideration and if they considered he was right in what he had said, then the whole of subsection (2) and the proviso would naturally go out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02971"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: This is not a matter of conflict, but of drafting. The first paragraph of subsection (1) of Clause 53 relates to the regulation of the proceedings of the Congested Districts Board and of the Administrative Committee. I think the Committee might as well go out altogether, because the Administrative Committee no longer exists. With regard to paragraph (ii), which relates to the regulation of the powers and duties of the permanent members, that I think should come out, too, because there are no permanent members.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02973"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am aware of that. What I am doing is to go into the noble Lord's objections. In paragraph (iii) he objects to the words "make such regulations as appear to him necessary or expedient for carrying into effect this Part of this Act." The noble Lord seems to be afraid that the effect of that will be to subordinate the Congested Districts Board to the Lord Lieutenant in Council. I think he is mistaken. Regulations in this case would be just like by-laws or regulations of any kind made under the power of an Act of Parliament. They must be regulations merely for carrying out the purposes of the Bill as is expressly stated in the paragraph I am discussing. They will not, as he appears to fear, subject the Congested Districts Board to a new yoke,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0503"/>
<col>993</col>
but will merely enable any machinery necessary for carrying into effect this Part of the Bill to be set up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02974"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> remarked that the words in the paragraph were the usual form of expression when Treasury regulations were made, and the effect of them was clearly to destroy the initiative of the Congested Districts Board or whatever officers were acting under the regulations. The Congested Districts Board had gained its popularity in Ireland and secured the success of its operations owing to its freedom from regulations of this kind. That was why he regarded the proposal in the Bill as a very serious matter. With the utmost respect for the noble and learned Lord on the Front Bench (the Lord Chancellor) he ventured to say there was a great danger in having any words in the Bill which could at any time be interpreted as giving power to the Irish Government or the Treasury to make rules or regulations which would control the actions of the Congested Districts Board. He thought the first paragraph of subsection (1) was required because he did not see any rules in the body of the Bill to regulate the quorum and meetings of the Committee and so on. He would be very glad to see the whole of Clause 53 go out and have provision made in the earlier part of the Bill regarding such matters as the quorum of the Committee. In that case they would leave things to be regulated as they were now, which would be a good thing, because the more freedom they gave to the Congested Districts Board the more successful would its working be, and the more it would commend itself to the public in the West of Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02975"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> observed that he said in the original remarks he made that he did not think this was a matter of first-class importance. He looked at it as being merely an attempt to bring the clause into harmony with changes which he anticipated would be made in the Bill. Therefore he sought to strike out paragraphs (i) and (ii) and to leave the third paragraph in the clause. It never occurred to him that his proposal was anything in the nature of a serpent in the grass. He was disposed to agree with the Lord Chancellor, but in deference to what had been said by the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell, he would consider before the Report stage whether there was any
<col>994</col>
possibility that the power of making regulations for carrying into effect this Part of the Bill would be misused.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02976"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: We do not think anything of the kind. People accustomed to the expression "the regulations" will, I think, agree with me that this is quite an ordinary form of procedure, and that it will have none of the terrible effects on the work of the Congested Districts Board that seem to be imagined as likely to be produced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02977">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02978"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> desired to move his Amendment to strike out the words in paragraph (iii) "or expedient for carrying into effect this part of this Act, "and to insert "for the audit of accounts." He had already expressed his great apprehension that if this paragraph remained as it was in the Bill rules would be made at the dictation of the Treasury, and the Congested Districts Board would virtually become a Treasury Department in Ireland. If any danger of that existed it would alienate the universal sympathy which the Board now enjoyed and tend to destroy the feeling of confidence which people now reposed in the Board. Therefore he thought it would be a dangerous thing to allow this paragraph to remain in the Bill. He did not see the least use in introducing the Privy Council into the matter at all. He had endeavoured to trace the genesis of the Privy Council in this connection, and he believed it must have been introduced in connection with the representative element of the Board under the Bill as it originally stood, because the power of making the regulations was usually given to the Lord Lieutenant independently of the Privy Council. It also appeared to him to be an exaggerated precaution to say that these regulations dealing with matters of very small importance should be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament. Unless there were matters of very great importance dealt with in the regulations that procedure was unnecessary. Ordinarily it was sufficient for the Lord Lieutenant to make regulations as to how a particular Act should be carried out. If there would be nothing more in the regulations than the noble and learned Lord said, and if it was intended that they should not fetter the Congested Districts Board, why should they be laid on the Table of the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0504"/>
<col>995</col>
House? He reserved to himself liberty, subject to their Lordships' permission, to raise the question again on Report, and to move the omission of the entire subsection, because he was greatly afraid of the effect it would have on public opinion in the West of Ireland.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02985"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved a new clause, to be inserted after Clause 54. He said the new clause raised a question they had already discussed&#x2014;namely, the transfer of the right to purchase land from the Congested Districts Board to the Estates Commissioners. The noble Marquess who led the Opposition had with general accuracy described the procedure which it was here wished to introduce. When the Congested Districts Board desired to acquire a particular estate or a particular tract of untenanted land, it would issue a requisition calling upon the Estates Commissioners to buy the land. The Estates Commissioners would then proceed to enter into negotiations with the landlords for the purchase of the land, and if they ended successfully and the land was
<col>996</col>
bought the Estates Commissioners would proceed to vest the land in the Congested Districts Board as was provided for in the new clause. The Congested Districts Board would then take possession of the land and go through the various processes which it was empowered by the Acts relating to the relief of congestion to perform. Then&#x2014;when everything had been done, when the holdings were "striped" or arranged, when the necessary drains were made and perhaps houses erected, agreements would be entered into with tenants. The tenants would be put in possession and the agreements would be deposited with the Land Commission. The Land Commission would then proceed to vest the land technically in the tenants and the annuities would be recovered. He hoped he would be able to induce their Lordships to agree that where compulsion was necessary the Estates Commissioners should, in accordance with the procedure in a scheme which he was prepared to submit for consideration, proceed to acquire land compulsorily. As to the tribunal, he was perfectly willing to meet the wishes of noble Lords opposite by inserting as the tribunal the Judicial Commissioner and two Judges of the High Court, so that there might be no fear of a want of impartiality on the part of the tribunal. The only other point he wished to refer to was that when untenanted land was bought outside a congested districts area the Estates Commissioners would before they made over the land to the Congested Districts Board relieve any local congestion which might exist, and having done that they would make over to the Congested Districts Board the land which remained. In a subsequent new clause he proposed that power should be given to the Lord Lieutenant to exclude from the congested area any electoral division in which congestion had been adequately relieved or, should it appear to him desirable, to include in the congested area an electoral division in which it was necessary for the operations prescribed for the relief of congestion to be put in force.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02987"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he was almost at one with the noble Lord on this question. As he understood, the object of the noble Lord's Amendment was to transfer the purchasing power of the Congested Districts Board to the Estates Commissioners and to provide that where the Commissioners bought land they should, assuming there was congestion there, relieve local congestion before they transferred the land to the Congested Districts Board. He would make this suggestion. The noble Lord used the words "the Land Commission shall proceed to acquire the estate or land accordingly in the manner provided by Part II and Part IV of this Act." Part IV was the portion of the Bill which dealt with compulsory purchase, and if he left those words in he would engraft upon the Amendment the compulsory system. The result would be that if the compulsory system were ultimately struck out the Amendment would have to be amended. The suggestion he had to make to the noble Lord was that he should alter the wording of the new clause to run, "accordingly in the manner provided by this Act," omitting the words, "Part II and Part IV." Then if the compulsory
<col>998</col>
powers should not be acquired he could not get compulsion, but, on the other hand, if the compulsory clauses were retained in the Bill he would have the benefit of those clauses to carry out his object.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02988"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> was quite willing to accept the noble and learned Lord's suggestion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02989"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member><membercontribution>: That means the noble Lord will omit the words "Part II and Part IV of," and the clause will read "The Land Commission shall proceed to acquire the estate or land accordingly in the manner provided by this Act."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-02991"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend behind me said that the noble Marquess opposite had given quite an accurate description of what he proposed to do in transferring these powers from the Congested Districts Board to the Estates Commissioners. As the matter was described by the noble Marquess I understood it was to be mainly a question of machinery; that is to say, that. the Congested Districts Board were to express a desire for the purchase of certain land and the Estates Commissioners were then to proceed to acquire it in the manner in which they acquire land outside the congested districts. After they had acquired it, as I understand, the administration of it would be handed over to the Congested Districts Board. That is a thing which, as a matter of machinery, may possibly be advantageous, though I confess I do not see the precise reasons for doing it.<lb/>
But when I look at my noble friend's Minute of Dissent I find that he suggests this course on an entirely different ground&#x2014;namely, that the Congested Districts Board have pampered and favoured the people on the estates they have bought, and that the proper way to deal with them is to treat them in the more indifferent and manly way which the Estates Commissioners have been accustomed to adop in dealing with their tenants. Would the Amendment as it stands on the Paper have any effect of that kind? It appears to me the effect of the proposal would be that the moment the purchase was completed by the Estates Commissioners the land would be vested in the Congested Districts Board. They would
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0506"/>
<col>999</col>
then have the disposal of it and would at once be able to begin what the noble Lord describes as "spoon feeding," with the results to their tenants which he deplores in his Minute of Dissent.<lb/>
If the Congested Districts Board are no to have the complete management of this land what functions are left to them? You have taken away their agricultural functions and fishery functions. You are taking away their purchase functions, and you want also to take away their management functions. Therefore I do not quite piece together my noble friend's Amendment with the view expressed by him in his Minute of Dissent from the Report of the Royal Commission. The noble Lord says&#x2014;
<quote>"I admit that the congested districts require special treatment, but nevertheless I think the Congested Districts Board's methods of relieving congestion are of a slower, more laborious, more minute and more eleemosynary character than seem really necessary in an undertaking of this great magnitude. Having seen the work of the Estates Commissioners and of the Congested Districts Board, I have formed the impression that the tenants on the Board's estates have not been made to 'work out their own salvation' to the extent that was good for them; and that the Estates Commissioners, while giving the people all the assistance they really required, have been more successful in inspiring a spirit of self-reliance and of self-help. We have it on the authority of trustworthy and competent witnesses who have seen the two bodies operating in the same neighbourhood, that they prefer the methods of the Estates Commissioners to those of the Congested Districts Board, though the evidence, especially the clerical evidence (mostly from districts in which the Estates Commissioners have not operated) is generally in favour of the Board. But the problem of relieving congestion is so enormous, its cost so great, and the necessity of building up self-reliance of character in these congested districts is so imperative, that it seems to me the better course not to do so much for the 'congested' tenant as the Board does, but to roughhew the holding for him and to leave to him and his family, with some money-help, the task of shaping it to their own ends. Spoon-feeding can be carried too far."</quote>
Then the noble Lord goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Estates Commissioners are already doing the kind of work required in the congested districts with marked success, expedition, and economy. If they were substituted for the Congested Districts Board they would finish the work in much less time than the Board would be likely to take."</quote>
Afterwards he speaks of all the experience the Estates Commissioners have had&#x2014;
<quote>"The Estates Commissioners have now acquired an experience in purchasing land, arranging holdings, migrating tenants, and disposing of all questions arising in connection therewith which makes them peculiarly fitted for this great work of the resettlement of the congested districts. It
<col>1000</col>
might be necessary to create in their Department a section devoted to the relief of congestion alone, the staff and funds now controlled by the Congested Districts Board being transferred to it."</quote>
I ask once more, what work is left to the Congested Districts Board under these proposals? It seems to me that if my noble friend's Amendment is intended to carry out the views expressed in his Minute of Dissent practically nothing at all is left to them. I stated before the difficulty which we found in adding this work to the labours of the Estates Commissioners, and I put the matter in this way. Either the work of the Estates Commissioners in this respect is to be purely ministerial, that is to say, the Estates Commissioners are simply to be empowered to carry out a particular piece of machinery at the request of the Congested Districts Board and then hand the land back to the Congested Districts Board for treatment and management, in which case I do not see the advantage of the proceeding, the Congested Districts Board being quite competent to carry through the purely machinery part; or else the Estates Commissioners in consideration of their superior methods of management are to carry on the administration of the land after they have acquired it. In that case the functions of the Congested Districts Board seem to me to disappear almost entirely. I have those two difficulties in giving support to my noble friend's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02992"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that under the Bill, where the Congested Districts Board wanted to acquire land compulsorily they were to do the very thing the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, proposed in his Amendment. Therefore the Estates Commissioners who, according to the noble Earl the Leader of the House were too overburdened and could not buy an estate for the Congested Districts Board under the Amendment of the noble Lord, could buy all the land which was acquired compulsorily over the whole of Ireland under the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02993"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That proves to what a small extent in practice compulsory powers will have to be exercised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02994"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> could not but express his astonishment that officials who were too much overburdened to buy an estate for the Congested Districts Board were not too much overburdened to buy compulsorily if needed, all the land in Ireland for the Congested Districts Board under the compulsory clauses of the Bill.

He understood the great objection to the existing system urged in the Report of the Dudley Commission was the competition between the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners as two buyers in the same market. It was to avoid that competition that the present proposal was made; but besides that he thought the Amendment desirable because the Estates Commissioners had a more extended experience than the Congested Districts Board and a better staff for buying land. After providing for local congestion the Estates Commissioners would transfer the balance of the land to the Congested Districts Board to be managed and disposed of by the Board in accordance with their powers as seemed fitting to them. That seemed to him to be a very beneficial object to effect, because it would both save expense and facilitate the acquisition of land</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02995"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> thought the noble Earl the Leader of the House was under some misapprehension as to what he meant by his statement in the Minute of Dissent. What he said as to the better methods of the Estates Commissioners in regard to the management of land led up to his suggestion that the Congested Districts Board should be abolished and the whole work should be handed over to the Estates Commissioners. He pointed out that if the Board were kept in existence there would be a lengthy delay in solving the problem, and gave reasons why he thought the Estates Commissioners would be more efficient for the purpose. He was still of opinion that the system of administration of the Estates Commissioners was better than that of the Congested Districts Board and more calculated to create a virile peasantry. He hoped that the Board might improve upon the methods they had followed up to the present. Their Lordships were unwilling to consider the question of abolishing the Board. They decided that the Board must be kept, and if the Board was kept of course the work of improving holdings and of relieving congestion, which, after all, was the main work the Board had done up to the present time, remained with the Board. The only work to be transferred to the Estates Commissioners was the purchase of land for the Board. If the Board was to be preserved they must do the work of improving the estates before they resold them to the tenants. As regarded what the noble Earl had said about overloading the Estates Commis-
<col>1002</col>
sioners, might he point out that over and over again the Estates Commissioners had expressed their ability to dispose of&#x00A3;10,000,000 worth of land per annum. The proposal was to raise only &#x00A3;5,000,000 a year and to allocate &#x00A3;1,000,000 to the Congested Districts Board and &#x00A3;4,000,000 for property paid for altogether in cash or partly in stock and partly in cash. If as much as &#x00A3;5,000,000 worth of land under future purchases were paid for in stock, the work would be no more than the Estates Commissioners had frequently declared themselves capable of performing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02996"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It is most important that there should be no misapprehension as to the way in which this Amendment would work if added to the Bill. I understood the noble Earl the Leader of the House to fear that its effect would be on the one hand to overload the Estates Commissioners with a great quantity of new and onerous work, and on the other hand to leave nothing to be done by the Congested Districts Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02997"><sup>*</sup><member>THE. EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: What I endeavoured to explain was that either it would have that effect, or, if not, supposing it was intended that the Estates Commissioners should carry out merely the process of purchase, without possessing the land or administering it, I could not see the object of bringing in the Estates Commissioners at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02998"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The object is this. We believe the Estates Commissioners are much better qualified to buy land in Ireland than the Congested Districts Board. The Committee may remember that the purchase of land was not part of the duties originally assigned to the Congested Districts Board. The practice grew up gradually, and there is now a state of things in which two Departments are absolutely competitors as buyers of land in Ireland. In our view that state of things should be put an end to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-02999"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The Government recognise that, and we do put an end to it in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

mission, that is the land which remains over when the local congests have been provided for, should be handed over to the Congested Districts Board. I take it the consequence of that will be that the Board will deal with that land exactly as it deals with any land which it acquires at this moment. It will have the same functions as to the improvement of it, the striping of it if held in rundale, and the apportionment of it to suitable occupants. Therefore I do not think there need be the least fear that the Congested Districts Board will be ousted by this Amendment from functions which properly appertain to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03001"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> found himself in agreement with the noble Earl the Leader of the House as to the undesirability of transferring the power of purchase from the Congested Districts Board to the Estates Commissioners. His experience was that the Board knew a great deal more about land in the conges<ob/>ed districts than the Estates Commissioners. Their officials were on the spot and it was only natural that they should be better acquainted with the conditions. He thought, in view of all the circumstances, the Congested Districts Board were better able to judge the price they could give than the Estates Commissioners, because it was the policy of the Congested Districts Board when they bought land to retain it in their possession for a certain time. The land was let on the eleven months system or the Board took in grazing cattle, with the result that they acquired a considerable sum of money. That money the Board were able to expend in what the noble Lord opposite would describe as improving the estate, but in what he should</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03011"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved the insertion of another new clause. He said the meaning of the clause was that if the Lord Lieutenant desired he might exclude from the congested area any electoral division in which congestion had been adequately relieved. There was no object in retaining an electoral division within the ambit of the schedule and spending money when the congestion had been sufficiently relieved. On the other hand if there were an electoral division which the Lord Lieutenant thought should be scheduled and be brought within the congested area for improvement he would have power to bring it in.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03012">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To insert the following new clause:</quote>
<quote>'56. If at any time it appears to the Congested Districts Board that it is expedient to, include under the provision of section 36 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1881 (which relates to the congested districts counties), an electoral division other than the divisions mentioned in subsection one of that section, or to exclude from that provision any electoral division it shall be lawful for the Lord Lieutenant to include or exclude, as the case may be, such division.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord MacDonnell of Swinford.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03013"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> was not quite certain that noble Lords appreciated exactly what the proposed clause did. It laid down the principle that an electoral division other than a division mentioned in subsection (1) of Section 36 of the Act of 1881 might be scheduled in the congested area by the Lord Lieutenant on the motion of the Congested Districts Board. That was rather a serious change, and would

permit of a very large extension of the area of the Congested Districts Board if it pleased the Lord Lieutenant to make it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03014"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> thought there was really no harm in the clause. The Act of 1891 which created the Congested Districts Board gave a particular definition of what a congested district should be but added the provision that the Lord Lieutenant for the first twelve months after the passing of the Act, might add to it or not. What the noble Lord proposed in his clause was that instead of within twelve months after the passing of the Act the Lord Lieutenant might add an electoral division to the congested area from time to time should the necessities of the division require it to be included.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03025"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would ask your Lordships' indulgence while I say one or two words with respect to this Bill, because I had intended to put down an Amendment on the Paper and by some accident it has not been circulated with the other Amendments, not through any fault of the officers of the House, but by some unfortunate accident caused by myself. But I understand that in consequence I should not be entitled technically to move this Amendment at the present stage. I will, with your Lordships' permission, explain what it is I wish to do, and if His Majesty's Government raise any technical objection, the matter in so far as the Amendment itself is concerned must, of course, drop; but when I explain it I think it possible that His Majesty's Government may not wish to press that point.<lb/>
<col>1008</col>
When the Bill was in Committee an Amendment of mine was carried embodying what is now Clause 56 in the Bill instead of subsections (4) and (5) of what is now Clause 55 of the Bill. Your Lordships will remember that the effect of the clause which I asked your Lordships to substitute for subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 55 practically removed what we thought were the extreme powers of the Local Government Board with respect to many matters under the town-planning part of the Bill and substituted the procedure of Provisional Orders in these respects. I do not propose to go further into that question than to explain it that far. Objections, I understand, have been taken to the Provisional Order procedure on two grounds&#x2014;one ground being the question of its cost, and the other the question of the delay necessary for carrying out Provisional Orders. I will not disguise from your Lordships that I rather think both those views have been somewhat exaggerated. The noble Earl the Lord Chairman gave some very interesting and instructive figures in Committee with respect to the question of cost, and I think the question of delay has also been perhaps made rather more of than need be. But we on this side of the House have no desire whatever to set up any obstacle to the efficient carrying out of this part of the Bill. We are quite as anxious as His Majesty's Government are that these town planning schemes should be effectively and reasonably quickly carried out; but our view has been, and is still, that though rapidity and freedom from excessive cost are very desirable, there are other things in these clauses of the Bill that require protection and careful consideration, and our view has been that the powers proposed to be given to the Local Government Board were far more than those which Parliament ought to authorise. We, therefore, asked your Lordships to include in lieu of those powers to the Local Government Board the procedure of Provisional Order.<lb/>
We now hear that there is considerable objection raised to that upon the grounds that I have already stated to your Lordships, and therefore we have endeavoured to consider in what way we can suggest a method by which the delay and cost of Provisional Orders can be avoided and by which at the same time there can be a judicial authority as apart from an
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0511"/>
<col>1009</col>
executive authority to deal with these matters as they come up from the local authorities. We have had to criticise, and I think we criticised with absolute justice, certain methods of certain Departments of the State, and this has made us look somewhat askance at giving extra powers indiscriminately to Government offices; but I am bound to say that one discriminates very much between the heads of and the action taken by certain Departments and others, and I have not a word to say against the President of the Local Government Board for the manner in which he has administered his Deparment. So far as I have been as an outsider able to match his procedure, I believe he has endeavoured to carry out faithfully the duties placed upon his Department by Parliament, and I should be very glad to strengthen his hands. But, my Lords, we are not dealing in these matters with individuals but with Departments of the State, and we are bound to guard ourselves against what may be unfair action in the future, although the present head of the Department may be one of those whom we would most readily and fully trust.<lb/>
In looking to see what we could do in order to ease the position of objection to the Provisional Order procedure, we have turned our minds to the clause which is printed under my name although it is not amongst the marshalled Amendments to be moved to this Bill. We suggest in that Amendment that, instead of the Provisional Order procedure we should adopt the procedure under the Commissioners whom it is proposed, we understand, to create under the Development Bill, which has just come up to your Lordships' House. We propose, in the words of the Amendment, that, in Clause 56, page 32, after line 7&#x2014;that is, at the end of the subsections of the clause I asked your Lordships to insert (Clause 56) should be inserted these words&#x2014;
<quote>"If and so long as Development Commissioners are appointed under any Act of the present session, every order of the Local Government Board, which under the foregoing provisions of this section would require before coming into force to be confirmed by Parliament, shall be referred by the Board to the Development Commissioners, and if after holding an inquiry the Commissioners are satisfied that an order should be made, they may confirm the order either without modifications or subject to such modifications as they think fit, and an order when so confirmed shall, notwithstanding anything in this section contained, have effect as if it were an order, not being a Provi-
<col>1010</col>
sional Order, made by the Commissioners in the exercise of their powers under any such Act as aforesaid."</quote>
That would give us a judicial body, as I said before, as compared with an executive body, for we understand&#x2014;and I assume we are right in understanding&#x2014;that these Development Commissioners are to be a judicial body in the strongest sense of the term. Therefore we suggest this as a method of easing the situation, and as a clause which we hope would be more satisfactory to His Majesty's Government than the Provisional Order procedure which now stands in the Bill.<lb/>
I think there are two points that would require further consideration at your Lordships' hands. One is the question whether by this procedure it might not be said that these Development Commissioners would be able to override the decision of the Local Government Board. I think there is something in that contention, and I would suggest that it may be met in this way&#x2014;that if the Development Commissioners, under the powers we propose to give them by this clause, should not concur with the Local Government Board, the Board need not necessarily be set aside by the Commissioners, but that the Local Government Board might in such a case as that claim that the town-planning scheme which was under consideration should not be set aside by the Commissioners themselves but should go through the Provisional Order procedure. It could, therefore, only be set aside by Parliament itself. We should be ready on this side of the House to accept some suggestion of that sort, and it appears to us that in that way you would get rid of the objection&#x2014;and I think is some ways reasonable objection&#x2014;to a Government Department being overridden by the Commissioners.<lb/>
I have words to that effect which I could read to your Lordships if necessary, but I only put forward the suggestion as one which I trust His Majesty's Government will consider. I hope they will consider all the suggestions we have made as an endeavour to meet what we thought were objections on their part and with a view to meeting them fairly and making the Bill work, as we think, better than it would otherwise have done. I am entirely in the hands of the House as to moving this Amendment. If His Majesty's
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0512"/>
<col>1011</col>
Government raise any objection, I must admit that they are quite within their rights and I should have no complaint to make; but if it is the pleasure of His Majesty's Government not to raise any technical objections, and if technical objections are not raised in any other part of the House, I will proceed with this Amendment when we come to the proper stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03026"><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although His Majesty's Government are unable to agree to the Amendment which the noble Earl has intimated to your Lordships, I can assure him that the last thing in their minds would be to wish to take advantage of any technical error as a reason for objecting to the insertion of these words. I venture to hope that His Majesty's Government may even be successful in persuading your Lordships that there are good reasons against inserting the noble Earl's Amendment. The fact of the matter is that since the noble Earl inserted his Amendment to this part of the Bill the opinion of the Local Government Board has been if I may say so, that the bite of the noble Earl is a great deal worse than his bark, and while he, I am sure, has been genuinely anxious not to impede the operation of town-planning schemes, the result of the Amendment which he moved, is, in their opinion, such as will make it very much more difficult to operate in the future.<lb/>
But may I point out to the noble Earl one consequence at any rate of the Amendment which he has placed on the Paper to-day. It would be this, that there would be an appeal from the decision of the Minister in charge of the Local Government Board to this new body to be set up under the Development Bill&#x2014;a body which will have no Parliamentary responsibility of any kind, and whose action, therefore, would not be subject, at any rate in the first instance, to any control. That, of course, stated in that way at any rate, is not a course to which you Lordships are very likely to give assent without further proceedings, which I think were adumbrated by the noble Earl. One of the taunts with which we have become most familiar on this side of the House is the anxiety of the Local Government Board and of His Majesty's Government to-set up a bureaucracy. This suggestion of the noble Earl opposite seems to me to go some
<col>1012</col>
way in that direction, because the position of the new Development Commissioners would be under this Bill exactly opposite to that which they would occupy in relat on to the Treasury and the other Government Departments under the Development Bill. Under that Bill they will make recommendations to the Treasury and other Departments concerned, but under the Amendment of the noble Earl they would review the action of the Government Department concerned, and your Lordships will see that that is putting them in a very different position.<lb/>
But the other argument which I hope will appeal to noble Lords opposite is this&#x2014;that the Commissioners are not really a suitable body to approve of town-planning schemes. The Development Commissioners will be concerned with the development of agricultural life. Town-planning is concerned with the development of town life, with the due increase of the areas in which there will be buildings, and with matters of that kind. The duties of the Development Commissioners will be almost exactly opposite. They will be concerned with forestry, land drainage, rural transport, and a variety of matters which have relation to the development of country life and have very little indeed to do with the matters which really come under town-planning schemes. Although, therefore, His Majesty's Government are unable to accept this Amendment, I hope I may say that the desire of the noble Earl opposite to meet the Local Government Board in this matter must give great satisfaction to His Majesty's Government, and I hope that it foreshadows on a future stage an agreement which will be if not satisfactory, at any rate not unsatisfactory to both sides of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03027"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is, it must be admitted, a certain difficulty, but I do not think at all an unprecedented difficulty, in discussing anything like the details of the Development Bill at the same time as we are discussing this Bill. It is a very common procedure to embody in a Bill on its passage through Parliament an additional clause which depends upon another Bill which is also pending. There are precedents for that, But I am driven to make this one observation in connection with what the noble Earl said, because I do think he might have made himself familiar, if I may say so without offence, with the leading provisions of the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0513"/>
<col>1013</col>
Development Bill when he offered his observations to the House. He says, for example, that the Development Bill has to do with nothing except rural life. What relation have the construction and improvement of harbours with rural life? The noble Earl will see at once that he will have to reconsider a little the view he takes of one of the principal measures of this session.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl said our proposal at the present moment was a wonderful inversion because there was to be a reference from the Local Government Board to the Commissioners, and that was exactly the contrary of what happens under the Development Bill; but I find words that the Treasury, having, I presume, considered an application under the Development Bill, are to refer it to the Development Commission. That is what happens in the Development Bill. I do not mean to press it too far; but certainly upon the face of it this does not seem so diametrically opposed to the procedure suggested under the Development Bill. It is common knowledge that the Development Bill underwent very serious development itself in the course of its passage through another place, and that whereas at one time the whole of the development was put in the absolute hands of a political Department&#x2014;namely, the Treasury&#x2014;to do as they liked or as the Parliamentary Minister under the influence of Party Government wished them to do, later on there was substituted a perfectly independent, almost a judicial, authority, who were to be supreme in their decisions&#x2014;that is to say, not to be subject to the review of the Treasury, and who were to be appointed, if not for life, at any rate for a long term. In those circumstances I think the noble Earl will see that although master of the Housing Bill, he is not yet a master of the Development Bill.<lb/>
I hope that your Lordships and the Government, especially the Government, will consider very carefully before rejecting the offer which we have made to them in respect of this clause. It is a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> offer; it is an offer founded upon experience, and it is an offer which I believe would lead to a statesmanlike settlement of this very difficult question. It is not that we distrust the Provisional Order system, but we do recognise that it is long and that it is in some respects unsatisfactory. It is not so unsatisfactory as the proposals which the Government themselves made, because those proposals subjected the whole of the ad-
<col>1014</col>
ministration of town-planning to the will of the President of the Local Government Board for the time being. I desire, if I may, to re-echo what my noble friend has just said as to our sincere appreciation of the great and substantial efforts which the present holder of that office has made in the cause of local government. We do not desire in anything we do to suggest that he is not worthy of trust, and for my own part I shall be very glad, if and when the Development Bill comes before us to be considered in Committee, to see whether the Local Government Board is properly represented in the Development Bill. Considering that the Development Bill has to do with local government and nothing but local government, I think the Local Government Board are treated with rather scant courtesy by the framers of the Bill, and it may be the duty of your Lordships to strengthen the position of the Local Government Board in the machinery of the Bill. So far, therefore, are we from desiring to put any slight upon the Local Government Board that, on the contrary, we should, if possible, desire to promote it to further honour.<lb/>
But as regards this present proposal, we do think that the objection to the Provisional Order procedure is amply met by such a system as we propose. The objection to the Provisional Order system is not so much an objection to the expense, although there is something in that, but it is an objection on the ground of time, for it is a rather cumbersome system. The system of Commissioners would enable the work to be got through rapidly and would lead to the establishment of a set of precedents of a very valuable kind which would be accepted by those interested in town-planning schemes and would enormously shorten the proceedings and stop litigation, because when it was known that the Development Commissioners after having tried case after case of town-planning had come to certain conclusions, it would not be necessary to try those proposals over again. The difficulty, of course, of the Provisional Order system is that there may be a certain variation of treatment as between Committee and Committee. No doubt that is a blemish, but, as I say, it is not so great a blemish as leaving it to a Government Department. There may be great differences of opinion as between Presidents of the Local Government Board, as the holder of that office changes, but the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0514"/>
<col>1015</col>
Commissioners would be a permanent body, and appeal might safely be made to them with the knowledge that they would act on certain well-defined rules. We believe this is a very good system. My noble friend Lord Cawdor entrusted me with the duty of seeing that this Amendment was placed on the Paper, and it is my fault that it is not there and I take all the blame. We think that really the important matter is not what one or two noble Lords on this Bench think, but what your Lordships as a whole and above all what the Government in another place think, and we say in the strongest possible way that this is a reasonable and <i>bona fide</i> offer which, if they cannot accept now, they should accept before the proceedings on this Bill conclude.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03028"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when we were discussing the original Amendment proposed by Lord Cawdor, the noble Earl who leads the House said that the Provisional Order system would naturally be to the Chairman of Committees of your Lordships' House the leather of the cobbler and that there was nothing like it. If I have got any leather, I think it would rather be the Private Bill which brings in fat fees to both Houses of Parliament, though that is undoubtedly an expensive method of procedure. Next to that I confess that I am enamoured of the Provisional Order system as a means of establishing an independent tribunal, but the only object I had in urging your Lordships to adopt the Provisional Order procedure was that it would give us an independent tribunal. I want to say, in common with the noble Earl opposite and in common with noble Lords behind me, that I desire to see this Bill on the Statute Book before the present session closes, and whatever tribunal I might myself prefer, I say at once that I am ready to accept any tribunal provided it is independent and not likely to be governed by political considerations. That is also what is sought by my noble friend behind me.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite said that this was another form of bureaucracy. I do not know quite how the noble Earl opposite would define the word bureaucracy. If it means that the decision of these matters would be in the hands of a bureau consisting
<col>1016</col>
of independent commissioners, I say that is a form of bureaucracy to which I take no exception; but I should object if it is to be in the hands of a Government Department at the head of which is a member, a distinguished member in every case, of the Party which for the time being is in power, and who, whatever may be his own desire to act with perfect impartiality, cannot avoid from time to time being influenced by those who support the policy of the Government and who sit behind him, whether he be in this House or in the other House. That is the danger which we see and which we want to avoid. I venture to think that the scheme which my noble friend now proposes is quite as good as, and less expensive than, the scheme which he proposed to your Lordships in the Committee stage of the Bill. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill said that these Development Commissioners would not be a suitable body because they would be charged with rural rather than with urban matters, but I venture to ask your Lordships are Committees of Parliament specially suited to decide either rural or urban or any other question? Are they not as a rule chosen because they are men of common sense and of business and likely to exercise an impartial judgment? Therefore whatever may be the main duties of these Commissioners, they are quite as likely to be possessed of those qualifications as a Committee of either House of Parliament.<lb/>
But there is one thing I do not see in the Amendment of my noble friend, and as to which I think the House ought to be a little careful. Where land has been specially set apart by Parliament for a particular purpose, ought anybody except Parliament to come in and say that that land is to be devoted to another purpose? I think that in those cases it is right that Parliament, and Parliament alone, should decide whether its original decision ought to be set aside. With that exception, I confess that if it is likely to be accepted by His Majesty's Government, I should be very glad to see the proposal become part of the Bill, but whether it is accepted by the Government or not, I am perfectly certain it will be regarded by those outside this House as a real and honest endeavour on the part of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House to secure an impartial tribunal acceptable, if possible, to the Government,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0515"/>

with the one and only object of seeing this Bill placed on the Statute Book.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03029"><sup>*</sup><member> THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY of STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we all recognise the admirable intentions of noble Lords opposite in expressing, as they have, this modification of their views with regard to the sanction which is necessary for a town-planning scheme. When we were debating it before we gathered from noble Lords opposite that they considered that the proceeding by Provisional Order was perfect for this purpose, and they would not admit our plea that it was both an expensive and probably a cumbersome process, and for this reason. In this particular matter of town-planning I am afraid we must look forward in almost every case to some degree of opposition from some owner or another. It is not likely, I think, at any rate in town-planning schemes where a number of owners are concerned, that some owner will not, particularly before the idea has sunk into the public mind that town-planning as distinct from private development is a good thing&#x2014;until that idea has been generally received we must look forward to some opposition in most cases, and that, of course, would add in no small degree to the trouble and expense of securing the Provisional Order.<lb/>
Now noble Lords think that this modification of the Provisional Order system may be desirable. I do not deny that there is a certain attraction in the notion of a permanent board superintending these operations, but I think force must be attached to what my noble friend said about this proposed enlargement of the scope of the Commissioners work. It is quite true, as my noble friend the Lord Chairman has said, that so far as the competence of the tribunal is concerned, there is no reason why it should not be just as able to cope with a town development scheme as with those schemes of general economic development with which it is entrusted; but if this addition were made to their labours it would be an enormous addition, because I think it cannot be disputed that if you are to entrust these three gentlemen with supervision of the planning of the suburbs of every town in England at one time or another, you will add very largely to the labours already to
<col>1018</col>
be laid upon them by the Bill which has just come before your Lordships. The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, I think was not quite accurate in his description of the relations between the proposed Development Commissioners and the Treasury, because if I remember rightly every scheme that the Commissioners make has to be reported to the Treasury and sanctioned by them, and that is not the proposition, or anything like it, which Lord Cawdor makes in this proposed Amendment.<lb/>
I think we need not try to split hairs over the term bureaucracy. I am not otherwise than surprised at the same time that noble Lords opposite should be prepared to give these great powers to an irresponsible body set up in this way. For some days of late we have been discussing the proceedings and the possible powers of a body of a similar nature&#x2014;the Irish Estates Commissioners&#x2014;and we have heard a great many criticisms levelled at them, and a strong indisposition to furnish them with any powers that can be kept away from them without the control of some Court of law. After all when noble Lords opposite talk about the advance of bureaucracy and the encroaching powers of Departments, at any rate those Departments are responsible to Parliament, and the Minister who is in charge can be called to account in either House by question or by debate, and if his action is so desperately bad as to deserve public censure, he may in the last resort lose his office, or the Government of which he is a member may be removed from power. At any rate, whether you think that the control of Parliament over the Public Offices is sufficient or not, it is far greater than any which can exist over a body of this kind once appointed, and we may assume, as we should always venture to do, that sensible and reasonable men will be placed upon this body. I hope that is always sure to be the case, but there again the treatment of these matters by the Commissioners will and must depend in some degree upon their personal idiosyncrasies, and, therefore, if it is a question of a safeguard against a particular point of view being too much pressed by the deciding body, I cannot feel myself that you are in reality so safe with a permanent body of this kind as you are with a responsible Department. That, however, is a matter of opinion, and, of course, noble Lords opposite are entitled
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0516"/>
<col>1019</col>
to take the opposite view if they choose. I need not say any more until we come to the Amendment. My noble friend behind me has stated in general terms that it is not possible for the Government to accept it, but, of course, it is open for noble Lords to insert it in the Bill if they so desire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03030"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with much interest and with a certain amount of hope to the suggestions made by the noble Earl opposite. When this Bill issued from Committee, in the interests of my own neighbourhood I read it through carefully, and I confess I came to this House with the feeling that a great number of the restrictive Amendments which had been added to the Bill were such as would tend to make it largely inoperative in the places with which I am acquainted. But if I am right in my impression I welcome the suggestions of the noble Earl because they seemed to me to indicate a desire in some degree to modify what was done in Committee so as to make this Bill a really more effective Bill for the purposes for which it was intended than it could possibly be if placed on the Statute Book in its present form. I am not speaking at all from the point of view of His Majesty's Government. I have a feeling that His Majesty's Government, in declining to receive the two useful Amendments which I put before the House, did not give those Amendments that consideration which they intrinsically deserved.<lb/>
It is from an entirely different point of view that I desire to address your Lordships for a moment&#x2014;from the point of view of such men as the medical inspectors in our districts who are doing a most valuable service in the interests of the people. If your Lordships would care to look at any of the health journals you will see that a great amount of disappointment is prevalent among that body of men, who have the very best of information on these subjects, as to the probable effect of the Amendments which have been passed in Committee in this House. Then, again, I venture to say we are concentrating our attention, as we are apt to do, far too exclusively on the subject of property. We have failed in some degree to give adequate weight to the interests of those who have to occupy these cottages, the men and the women and the children who have to live and to die in them; and therefore I most sincerely hope, in the spirit indicated by the noble Earl, that when the
<col>1020</col>
opportunity arises, as I trust it will arise, very considerable modifications may be made in this Bill with regard to the Amendments that were inserted as it passed through Committee. In the abstract, we are all equally desirous that the working classes should live in healthy and suitable homes, and your Lordships, like the rest of us, lament the tendency to depopulation there is in the country districts. But the general result of what has been done in Committee on this Bill, so far from remedying that which we lament, would tend to intensify it, because the Bill would be, as I have said, largely inoperative just in those districts and places in which it is specially needed.<lb/>
Some reference has been made to the difference between town and country. I do not venture at this moment to say anything about city slums or pit villages, or such like. What I desire to draw your attention to is the great need which prevails in many parts of our country districts. I speak only of my own experience and with regard to my own diocese. I feel that if this Bill could be brought into active and unhampered operation it would meet very pressing evils. We are suffering in many parts from the great want of cottages, and I desire to say something on the point of giving an adequate supply of cottages in our country districts. As your Lordships know very well, in many parts of the country we have admirable cottages under the greater landlords, but there are many other parts in which the working classes find it almost impossible to acquire cottages in which to live. Not long ago I had myself an appeal on behalf of a postman who had to make his long round day by day, and who was obliged to add to that round about six miles of walking to get to his cottage. That excellent man, after several years of service, applied for a higher position under the Post Office, and the medical officer who had to examine him said that he could not recommend him for this higher position in his occupation because the excessive walking which had been laid upon him had so impaired his health that he was no longer fit for it.<lb/>
Then, again, every year, time after time, I have had it brought to my notice that young men and women up and down my diocese desire to be married but are unable to be married because they can get no cottage to live in in the places where their
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0517"/>
<col>1021</col>
work lies. Thus there are not only economic objections to this state of things, but moral objections. Your Lordships can hardly be surprised if, under such circumstances, illegitimacy prevails. Moreover, in spite of all that is done by the excellent landlords&#x2014;and there are many of them&#x2014;we have a great many cottages scattered all over the country which are in a very bad condition. I hold in my hands a Diocesan Report from my various incumbents, containing all sorts of references to the objectionable conditions in cottage life. I will not detain your Lordships with any extracts from it, because I desire not to intervene needlessly on your Lordships attention; but I do hope that when the opportunity arises some of those restrictive Amendments which have been added to the Bill may be modified by the aid of the noble Earl opposite. Not otherwise, as I believe, will this Bill have a really fair chance to do the good for our working classes which it was intended and framed to do.</membercontribution></p>

He said that his attention had been drawn to the fact that under subsection (2) of Clause 17 the owner seemed to be rather neglected with regard to these demolition and closing orders. At present a closing order had to be given by a magistrate and an owner had an opportunity of appearing and being heard against the complaint, but under subsection (2) of this clause there seemed to be no opportunity for an owner to lay his case before any one until a closing order had been finally given, although an owner had an opportunity of appeal to the Local Government Board or to the County Court under subsection (3).</p>

He did not think that the proviso suggested by the noble Viscount would be sufficient. It would be necessary without any doubt to alter the procedure under the course which the noble Viscount suggested. It would involve another meeting of the authority&#x2014;a second meeting, that was to say, at which the owner would be heard; but a good many local authorities did not meet more than once a month, and that would involve very considerable delay. If anything was to be done in this way, it would be better done by making it the duty of the clerk to the authority to send a copy of the representation to the owner as soon as he received it. He would like the noble Viscount to look at subclause (3) of Clause 17 wherein he would see that the owner was sufficiently safeguarded. One of the main objects of His Majesty's Government in this Bill had been to try and make the procedure less expensive and less dilatory than in the past, and that object would, he felt sure, be very largely defeated if the noble Viscount pressed his Amendment. In subclause (3) it would be seen that notices had to be served upon the owner when a closing order was issued, and then the owner had the option of appealing either to the Local Government Board or to the County Court. Under those circumstances he hoped the noble Viscount would not press his Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03052"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> was sorry to hear that His Majesty's Government could not see their way to accept the noble Viscount's Amendment. He had been asked to support the Amendment on behalf of the Building Societies Association, of which he had the honour of being president. This association comprised all the building societies in the United Kingdom; they had seventy millions of money invested in houses for the working classes, and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0519"/>
<col>1025</col>
they were very anxious that the local authorities should not make a closing order without informing the owner. Surely it was not right to make an order against a house without hearing the person to whom the house belonged or his agent. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill had called their attention to subclause (3) under which he said to some extent the grievance was met, but all that it did was to enable the owner after a closing order was made to appeal either to the Local Government Board or to the County Court. Surely an owner ought to be heard before the closing order was finally made. The noble Earl said that this would involve delay, but, after all, the greatest delay that could be possibly involved was a month; but if there was to be an appeal to the Local Government Board that would probably take much more than a month. On behalf of this association, which had an immense interest in this matter, he earnestly appealed to His Majesty's Government to reconsider this question. It was certainly a great hardship that a local authority should make a closing order against a house without hearing those to whom the house belonged.</p>

This subject was familiar to those of their Lordships who had followed the debates on this Bill. It might occur that a local authority would not make any regulations at all. That obviously was not a position contemplated by their Lordships, and it was therefore necessary to make some provision in case an authority did not make regulations. The Amendment was designed to meet that case.

The Local Government Board would only come in in such cases if a local authority had not made any regulations proposed under the Bill, and the Board would only make these regulations where there had been a failure on the part of a local authority.

It could not have been drawn up by a sanitary engineer, a builder, or a medical officer, for no member of those professions would have ignored the existence of skylights as a means of ventilation. The framer of this clause could not have read any elementary work on hygiene or made a tour through England on a bicycle or in a motor-car, otherwise he would have learned that buildings varied much in material, construction, shape and surroundings. Indeed, the framer was unfitted to dictate to the local authorities on such a subject as this, and he hoped that the House would not accept the Amendment, or if it did that the proviso would be amended by leaving out the words "such regulations as the Board approve.' That would leave the Local Government Board power to make regulations if none were made and the power to veto the regulations made by any local authority, but it would deprive the Local Government Board of absolute power, and of an

A good many of the noble Lord's strictures, he thought, would have been well deserved if applied to the clause as it at first commended itself to the Government, but in the course of the proceedings in that House, in Committee and on Report, the clause had undergone very great changes. It was agreed, he thought, on all hands that the rather meticulous provisions of the clause were much more adapted to by-laws than to an Act of Parliament, and therefore they were all struck out with the exception of one, which was carefully modified, and the whole of the procedure under the clause was left to be covered by regulations primarily made by the local authority. That he believed to be a much more workmanlike method of procedure; but His Majesty's Government had brought under their notice the fact that it was possible that an authority might not make regulations, or, if they did make them, that they might be insufficient. He must say he thought that was a case which required to be met, and as far as he was personally concerned he would not be prepared to resist the noble Earl's Amendment. He did not think it was likely to be misused. In the first instance, undoubtedly, the duty lay upon the local authority, and though this was giving a certain measure of confidence to the Local Government Board he hoped they deserved it, and therefore he hoped the House would agree to the Amendment.</p>

That was what he gathered was the meaning of the clause, if it was accepted in its entirety.

If they knew that they could only be compelled to make regulations, they could easily ride off by making some impossible ones, and they could claim that they had made them, and therefore the Board would have no jurisdiction.</p>

<col>1030</col>
scheme might be made as respects any land which is in course of development. "or is required in order to further such development," instead of "or appears likely to be used for building purposes," the words contained in the clause. He apologised to the House for putting down again at this stage an Amendment he had brought forward in Committee but which he had not pressed to a Division. His reason for putting it down again was that he did not think the point he wished to deal with had been adequately considered by the House. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, when they were on Report, pointed out that the tribunal had been altered since the Bill was introduced, by substituting a Provisional Order scheme for the decision of the Local Government Board, and on that ground the noble Marquess rather urged those who sat on that side of the House to take the view that, having altered the tribunal and secured a different one, it did not matter so much what was brought within the purview of that tribunal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03078">They had not yet arrived at Clause 56, but he understood that his noble friend Earl Cawdor was going to move on that clause that the Provisional Order scheme be struck out, and they would then be asked to put the decision of town-planning schemes into the hands of the Development Commissioners. He submitted that although the tribunal was a very important point in these questions of town planning, the matter that had to go before the tribunal was a still more important point, and was not exactly the same point as that deal with by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition the other evening. Several noble Lords agreed that the words "appears likely to be used for building purposes" was throwing the net very wide, perhaps rather wider than, any legitimate scheme of town planning demanded. Noble Lords on that side of the House were just as much in favour of any legitimate town-planning scheme as those on the other side, but whatever tribunal had to decide these questions, whether it was the Local Government Board or a Committee in the case of a Provisional Order, or, as was now suggested, the Development Commissioners, obviously the first thing they would do would be to take the Act of Parliament and look at the wording of it. If they looked at the clause as it stood they would see that it read "a town-planning scheme may be made in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act as respects
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0522"/>
<col>1031</col>
any land which is in course of development or appears likely to be used for building purposes," and so on. That clause would be, of course, their <i>vade mecum</i>, and the tribunal would say that any land which appeared likely to be used for building purposes must be included. In the neighbourhood of large towns it would affect an enormous area; and as any tribunal must be fallible, if the land were not at the end of a certain time released from the bar put upon it, grievous injustice might be caused. He still thought that the words he proposed to substitute&#x2014;namely, "is required in order to further such development"&#x2014;would really meet any legitimate requirements. The other night more than one noble Lord pointed out how difficult it would be for any tribunal to say what land was likely to be used and what was not. He thought his Amendment would be an improvement on the Bill, because if at the end of a certain number of years, say a quarter of a century, the land was not used, it was possible to apply for another town-planning scheme; but he did not think it was fair that the present occupier or owner of land within a great distance of a town should for ever have this bar put upon his land.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03080"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he would take first the question which the noble Lord had put to him. There was power to vary a scheme, but he was afraid he was unable to give the reference, as he had not been able to find it while the noble Lord was speaking, but if the noble Lord would look at the Fourth Schedule, page 50, paragraph 16, he would see that amongst the matters that should be dealt with by general provisions prescribed by the Local Government Board would be "limitation of time for operation of scheme." So the noble Lord might rest assured that the matter had not been entirely lost sight of This was the third time on which their Lordships had been asked to discuss this Amendment. On the first occasion it was withdrawn, because he thought in the view of the majority of noble Lords opposite the matter would be sufficiently safeguarded by the new clause which was moved by Earl Cawdor. If the noble Lord would look at subclause (7) of Clause 55, which defined the land likely to be used
<col>1032</col>
for building purposes, he would see that it did not involve any very large proposition. It was quite true that a considerable area might be involved, but that was just one of the points which His Majesty's Government had in view; in any town-planning scheme they wanted to effect improvements in regard to land which was likely to be developed for some years at any rate, and there were a number of safeguards in addition to those to which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition made special reference on the last occasion. There was a provision that nobody's land would be included in the scheme without his being consulted, and the Local Government Board, before they approved of any scheme, would hear anything he might have to say, and if his property was injuriously affected by the operation of the scheme he would be able to claim compensation. He admitted at once the intention of the Local Government Board and also of His Majesty's Government to anticipate the actual development by anticipating the best lines which the development would take. The Amendment would very greatly hamper any town-planning scheme, and might prevent a piece of land being included in a scheme which really ought to be included. He was sure, after the willingness which had been expressed by noble Lords on the other side of the House, that they would see that it was desirable to give the Local Government Board and the local authority power to include land which did appear likely to be used for building purposes, and not to limit it in the sense desired by the noble Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03081"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> said he had heard that the Local Government Board was an infallible body, but he thought the argument of the noble Earl upset that theory. Even a Government Office was not infallible, and it might, with the very best of intentions, make a mistake in planning out a scheme. He would ask the noble Earl whether a case of this sort had been contemplated? They were to take under this clause a very large area of land and include it in a town-planning scheme. Part of that area which now belonged to A was to be devoted to a particular purpose. Supposing that the Local Government Board imagined that that purpose would be carried into effect in, say, three to five years time. The whole settlement of the scheme, any compensation to which the owner might be entitled and so forth, would be settled upon that basis, upon the con-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0523"/>
<col>1033</col>
sideration of that probability. Supposing the scheme was a miscalculation? Supposing that for this particular purpose the land was not required? Supposing it had been intended for workmen's houses and that certain works were no longer carried on and that for certain other reasons the working classes did not go into that part of the area. That land might remain for an indefinite period absolutely sterile, and the effect of the town-planning scheme, instead of bringing more people on to it, would be to sterilise the area. There should be some provision for meeting a contingency of that sort, and if there was none already in the Bill the Amendment of his noble friend became a very reasonable one, that they should not include an indefinite amount of land in their scheme. It did not seem to him that the limitation of the scheme which was contained in the schedule met the point. The limitation spoken of there was a limitation of the scheme as originally contemplated. He did not see any clause which would enable the Local Government Board to say to an owner, "Well, we thought your land would be developed for working-class houses in five years time; it has not been developed in ten years; there is no probability of its being wanted for workmen's houses, but it may be used for some other purpose, and we will now give you leave to use it for that purpose."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03082"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDERSON</member> asked the noble Duke to look at subclause (10) of Clause 56, which ran&#x2014;" A town-planning scheme may be varied or revoked by a subsequent scheme prepared or adopted and confirmed in accordance with this Part of this Act on the application of the responsible authority, or of any other councilor persons interested."

I think this meets the point which was raised by the noble Duke, but I hope, at any rate, that the House will not accept the form of words proposed by the noble Lord opposite. I cannot conceive anything which would more hamper a town-planning scheme than those words. The words proposed by His Majesty's Government are, "A town-planning scheme may be made in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act as respects any land which is in course of development"&#x2014;that is to say, land which is laid out, and other land which is required in
<col>1034</col>
order to further such development, while all you could do under the noble Lord's town-planning scheme would be to take land which a builder would call ripe for building; that is to say a few acres, and just that amount of land which would be required for access to it, or, perhaps, to make an open space for it. But as to laying out anything on a large scale which it is hoped may be done, looking years ahead to the ultimate development of the town, the noble Lord's Amendment would make anything of that kind impossible. In fact, the words of his Amendment go further even than he has any intention of making them go. I confess I do not see the risk that is involved in the words as they stand in the Bill. I should be very glad if anybody would take land of mine which is not likely to be used for building and include it in a town-planning scheme, because I am convinced it would add largely to its value from the moment it was done. I have been trying to consider cases in which any hardship could fall upon an owner by the fact of his land being so included. I could understand a number of cases in which it might be a hardship for a particular piece of land to be included, owing to its position or something of that sort, but that is safeguarded by various restrictions. I do not see under what circumstances an owner could be damnified by the inclusion in a scheme of this kind of land, even if it was not likely to be used for building purposes. For what more profitable purpose could he use it? The fact of its being earmarked in a scheme could not surely do him any harm.</membercontribution></p>

The point is this. He is told it is to be turned into a public park. There will be an arbitrator, or whatever the tribunal is The man would say, "I could have sold that land now for building houses at so much an acre, and practically that is the compensation I must have in respect of the scheme." After that his interest in the matter has gone and it does not matter how soon or how late the land is turned into a public park. Until it is so converted, he can go on using it for market gardens or for whatever purpose it is occupied at the moment.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03088"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ST.

He could not help thinking that the main object of Lord Hylton in moving the Amendment was to prevent the land being held up for a very long time. As was said, the land might be held up from thirty to fifty years. He would like to know from the noble Earl in charge of the Bill whether under a town-planning scheme such a thing was possible. A town-planning scheme nobody could object to, but if when it was carried out it would have the effect of withholding land from all public purposes for such a long period they ought to know. Nobody wished to hinder a town-planning scheme or to interfere with the provision of parks when a town-planning scheme was begun, but if the scheme would have some such effect as he had spoken of, he hoped the noble Earl would explain what would happen under those conditions.</p>

He did not propose to dilate upon it now at any length, but there were three points that he would like to refer to. The first point was with respect to an interference with statutory enactments. As the clause stood in the Bill with respect to the procedure by Provisional Order, the clause he asked them to introduce at an earlier stage of the Bill, previous statutory enactments were guarded. He thought it would be only right that in this subsection some provisions should be also inserted in

order to guard statutory enactments, and he understood his noble friend Lord Clinton would move words to carry that out. There were two other points to which he desired to refer. He had already mentioned that it might be desired to protect a Government Department from being overruled by the Development Commissioners, and he suggested words to be added to his Amendment which he thought would meet that objection&#x2014;namely, "Where the Development Commissioners do not confirm the order referred to them, the order shall not be operative unless and until it has been confirmed by Parliament, and the Local Government Board may, if they think fit submit the order to Parliament under the provisions of this section." He understood that it was the view of some noble Lords that by this Amendment they would be giving too great and too large powers to a body of Commissioners of whom at present they did not know very much. That might be true and he supposed they must profess to know nothing of what the Commissioners would be in the Bill which they would have to discuss at a later period. But he suggested that if it was felt that they were proposing to give powers too great and too sweeping to these Commissioners, it might be well worth while to consider whether any orders which were confirmed by these Com missioners might not be laid before both Houses of Parliament, so that there would be an absolute check by Parliament on the proceedings of the Commissioners, and their decisions would not be in that case absolute.</p>

The words he proposed to add were "other than an order which contains the provisions in any statutory enactment." If this Amendment were carried without the addition of these words, schemes containing statutory enactments could be suspended by the Commissioners, and would not come under the purview of Parliament. He believed that was entirely contrary to the practice of Parliament. In all cases dealing with the compulsory taking of land for public purposes it had been provided that land which had been under a Provisional Order given to persons or companies for certain purposes should not be again taken away from them. That was a principle which they ought to affirm. He had an Amendment for this purpose during the Committee stage of the Bill, but he withdrew it because the clause the noble Earl inserted should have covered the whole matter; but as he believed it would be contrary to practice that bodies other than Parliament should deal with lands taken under a Provisional Order, he suggested the addition of these words.</p>

He might, however, say that this addition foreshadowed by the noble Earl would, in the event of a disagreement between the Development Commissioners and the Local Government Board, add considerably to the complexity of the Bill, because what would happen then would be this. First of all there would be an inquiry by the Local Government Board. Then supposing there was some objection to it, the matter would go to the Development Commissioners, and if they did not agree, then it would come before Parliament. That, of course, would mean a further stage. He confessed he did not fully understand it, but as far as he could understand it, it would add another and a

<col>1039</col>
somewhat expensive stage to a town-planning scheme. With regard to the Development Bill, upon his ignorance of which the noble Marquess opposite had twitted him&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03103"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Very respectfully.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03104"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> suggested that they should defer discussion of that subject to a later stage, when he hoped he would be able to persuade the noble Marquess that his ignorance was not so great as he thought. With regard to the actual Amendment, he could only repeat now that they had discussed the matter already, and His Majesty's Government would not oppose it but could not be said to agree to the introduction of the proposed new subsection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03105"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said he found himself in a very difficult position. He had been so far in entire agreement with the Amendments made in the Bill, but with every desire to be loyal to his noble friend Earl Cawdor, he was bound to say he did not approve of this Amendment at all. He had always been keenly interested in this Bill and approved of it, and, notwithstanding the most ridiculous and absurd things that had been said outside with regard to the action of their Lordships' House, he believed they had substantially improved the Bill and made it much more workable than it was before. In the earlier part of the Bill they had protected private interests by giving them the benefit of a legal tribunal. They had guarded against any suggestion of hardship or unfair conduct by Local Government Board officials by having an independent arbitrator, and the Amendment of the noble Earl which the House had adopted imported in certain cases a Provisional Order. Now it was asked that if there was an order which required to be sanctioned by Parliament, it should be referred beforehand by the Local Government Board to the Development Commissioners. One did not know what the practice of the Commissioners might be. They were not in existence at present, and a great deal might depend upon what functions were given to them. Desiring as he did to see this Bill a workable Bill and a good many of the schemes going through without opposition, it seemed to him they had sufficient protection in the matter. This Amendment was importing into the procedure an unknown step, and giving
<col>1040</col>
powers to an unknown body which were very like the powers originally asked to be entrusted to the Local Government Board. Having, as he had said, desired honestly to have this Bill and to make it a better Bill according to his own lights, it seemed to him a retrograde step to give these powers to this unknown body. It would be safer to rely upon machinery which was not expensive and of which they had knowledge. Unless he were satisfied by argument that the insertion of this subsection would be advantageous, he would be under the painful necessity of voting with the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03106"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> said he felt considerable diffidence about this Amendment, which was brought forward at a late period and which proposed to entrust very considerable power to a body not yet formed. It was also an Amendment which the noble Earl who had moved it had found it necessary to add to at the last moment. It seemed to him rather rash and hazardous to substitute for the machinery of the Bill, which had been carefully considered, other machinery of the working of which they knew nothing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03107"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member> said that he was disappointed at the course of the debate. This was surely a case for compromise. There were evidently two sides to this question. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said that on the Opposition side they appeared to be all enamoured of the system of Provisional Orders. He (Lord Cromer) hardly thought that was the case; a good many noble Lords like himself recognised that the system was open to considerable objections. He dared say they were exaggerated, but unquestionably the procedure was rather cumbersome and it was costly. He had drawn attention to that before, but there was no reason why they should run to the other extreme, and take away all the guarantees now afforded by the procedure. The people interested in these private Bills looked with very great confidence to their Lordships' Committees, and he thought it very likely, if they took that guarantee away, they would run the risk of introducing a method of procedure which might be likely to lead to electoral manipulation. There should be some compromise between these two extremes. He did not say that Earl Cawdor's Amendment was perfect. It might be open to the objections referred to by the noble and learned Lord
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0527"/>
<col>1041</col>
the Lord Chief Justice, but he would appeal to His Majesty's Government whether the Department concerned could not show sufficient elasticity and resource to find some middle way between these two extremes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03108"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It is satisfactory to us to know that the motives which prompted this Amendment are not misunderstood in any part of the House. We really desire to meet the criticism, to which we did not attach so much force as was attached to it by those who made it but which was nevertheless entitled to some weight&#x2014;that the procedure by Provisional Order suggested by my noble friend Lord Cawdor was open to the suspicion of being somewhat cumbrous and somewhat tardy. In order to meet that criticism my noble friend made this proposal, under which in certain cases resort was to be had to the Development Commissioners to be appointed under the Bill which was read a first time in this House this evening. I must say that those Commissioners seemed to me, for many reasons, to be admirably qualified for the duties which my noble friend proposed to assign to them. The Commission will be, we understand, a judicial body; it will be a permanent body, and a body which as time will go on will accumulate a great deal of extremely valuable experience. Perhaps that is the answer to what was said by the noble Earl opposite when he told us that the effect of this Amendment would be to increase enormously the burden of work on the Development Commissioners. In time, when the practice of the Commissioners comes to be fully understood, and when their decisions have created a body of valuable precedents, it would become less and less necessary to appeal to them. I confess I have heard nothing that seriously shakes my belief in the proposal made by my noble friend Lord Cawdor, but I think we have to consider this. The Amendment, owing to an unfortunate mistake, was only in your Lordships' hands this evening, and since we have had it in our hands it has been found necessary, as was pointed out, to amend the Amendment itself. In my experience of this House, which has been a pretty long one, I have observed that when proposals are thus sprung upon the attention of the House there has always been some scruple in pressing them unless they received the general support and concurrence of your Lordships. Enough has been said this evening to show that some notes of dissent
<col>1042</col>
have been struck, and under the circumstances I believe that my noble friend will not press the House to accept his proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03109">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03110">Drafting Amendments in Clause 57 agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03111"><member>LORD BELPER</member> moved to add to Clause 57 (Contents of town-planning scheme) the following words&#x2014;"Provided that no local authority shall be authorised, except as a constituent of a joint body constituted as aforesaid, to enforce the observance or the execution of a town-planning scheme under this part of this Act in respect of any land within the area of another local authority unless such other local authority is not prepared to carry out a town-planning scheme for the area in question." He said he moved the Amendment in pursuance of a question he asked on the Report stage, and he did not think the answer of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill quite covered the point which he wanted to raise. The point was that where a scheme had to stretch over the boundary of one authority and went into another authority's district, it was laid down in this clause that the scheme might be prepared by one of the local authorities, or for certain purposes of the scheme another local authority, or a joint body constituted specially for the purpose by the scheme. What was intended, he took it, was that in ordinary cases there should be a joint body to prepare a scheme, or in particular cases, where it seemed desirable, one authority should act for certain purposes for the other authority. But was it intended&#x2014;he did not think it ought to be&#x2014;that one local authority should be called upon to do the work in the area of another local authority while the authority which had jurisdiction over that area was willing to do it themselves? That would be a perfectly novel idea and he doubted very much whether the Local Government Board ought to give power to any authority to do work outside its own area and in the area of another authority without consent. Of course, if a local authority refused to take part in a scheme, there was very good reason for the Board having power to over-ride them, and allowing another local authority to do the work. As far as he could see, his Amendment was entirely in conformity with the scheme in the Bill, but he thought it made it clearer than as it stood now; at all events, it would prevent a local authority being over-ridden and another
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0528"/>
<col>1043</col>
local authority being allowed to have jurisdiction within their area.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03112">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 33, after line 13, to insert the words 'Provided that no local authority shall be authorised except as a constituent of a joint body constituted as aforesaid to enforce the observance or the execution of a town planning scheme under this part of this Act in respect of any land within the area of another local authority unless such other local authority is not prepared to carry out a town planning scheme for the area in question.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Belper.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03113"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> agreed with the noble Lord that the matter was not an unimportant one, but the reason why the Local Government Board were anxious to retain this power was that a big scheme might include a small portion of land within the boundary of some small rural authority and it was desirable that the larger authority should be enabled to do what was necessary to be done within the smaller area. The proposal of the noble Lord would prevent that unless they brought in the rural authority. That authority might act in an obstructive way, and might not be disposed to help the larger scheme in the way that perhaps they ought to do. He thought the noble Earl would see that under those circumstances there might be a real danger, and the small local authority might cause a good deal of inconvenience and also expense to the larger authority in carrying out a town-planning scheme. The matter was however, not an important one, and the Government would not think of asking their Lordships to divide.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03114"><member>LORD BELPER</member> asked whether the case referred to by the noble Earl was not covered by the words of his Amendment. If a local authority objected orders could be given to the others to do the work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03115"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member> could not help thinking that this was a somewhat more important question than either the noble Earl or the noble Lord who moved the Amendment seemed to think, and he fancied it assumed additional importance from what had just fallen from the noble Earl. It turned out that the object of the Bill as it stood was to impose upon small rural authorities the jurisdiction of a large town authority on its borders. Which was most likely to go to the wall, the scheme of a great and important public body like that of the corporation of a big town, or the
<col>1044</col>
council of a rural district? He would remind the noble Earl who had spoken of expense that the expense was going to fall upon the rural district. The corporation would do the work within the rural area, but, as he understood, the bill would fall upon the rural district, and yet the rural district was not to have any say in the matter when once the scheme was sanctioned. Surely that was not fair. He quite admitted that a rural authority should not obstruct a scheme which was for the benefit of a large town area, but if the words of the Amendment did not meet the case, let them put in words that would. Surely it could not be right to do away altogether with the power of a local authority over its own area within touch of an important town council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03116">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03117">Drafting and consequential Amendments agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03118">On Clause 61 (Exclusion or limitation of compensation in certain cases).</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03119"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member> moved to amend subsection (2), which provided that property should not be deemed to be injuriously affected by the operation of any provisions in a town-planning scheme prescribing the space about buildings or limiting the number or height or character of buildings. The noble Earl moved to omit certain words and to insert&#x2014;"Provided that if it shall appear to the arbitrator that such provisions are unusual and impose excessive restrictions upon the use of the property, and that under all the circumstances compensation should be awarded, he may, notwithstanding anything in this subsection contained, award such compensation as he may think just." He felt that he owed their Lordships an apology for bringing up this Amendment at this stage of the Bill, but his reason for doing so was that in the first place this particular subclause had never been properly discussed. It was brought under a closure resolution in another place, and although he had twice made attempts to amend it in their Lordships' House, those attempts had unfortunately fallen through. If they would turn to Clause 61 of the Bill, subclause (2), they would notice that that subclause imposed upon the owners of land conditions which he could only describe as unnecessarily arbitrary and excessive. He would not have
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0529"/>
<col>1045</col>
brought up this Amendment again had he not been under the belief, possibly misplaced, that their Lordships had not entirely realised the danger of passing this clause with this subclause in it. He believed there were provisions in Clause 59 where an owner of property, if he thought himself aggrieved, might recover compensation. But subclause (2) of Clause 61 expressly and once and for all excluded from any hope of compensation a landowner whose land was thus injuriously affected. He hoped their Lordships would see the injustice of allowing this Bill to pass with this subclause remaining unaltered. His Amendment would not materially affect the provisions of the Bill or the object which His Majesty's Government had in view and with which noble Lords on that side of the House were so much in sympathy, but it would provide in certain extreme cases which he could well imagine that compensation should be payable if the arbitrator should think that compensation just.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03121"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> thought their Lordships had already discussed the Amendment of the noble Earl once, if not twice, during the various stages of the Bill. He had taken part before in those discussions and he was reluctantly forced to speak on the Amendment again by what had fallen from the noble Earl opposite. He hoped he might congratulate their Lordships on the fact that it was not a frequent practice in their Lordships' House to propose on Third Reading Amendments which had been negatived on previous occasions without a Division. He would point out to the noble Earl that there were ample provisions in the Bill for the compensation of any owner whose land was injuriously affected, and the Amendment, he thought, went a great deal further than the noble Earl probably understood himself, because it would allow an arbitrator to go behind the facts which had been considered by Parliament and award compensation which a Select Committee did not think necessary. Under those circum-
<col>1046</col>
stances he hoped their Lordships would once more negative the Amendment without a Division.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03122"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> said the Amendment of his noble friend was certainly an important one, but he must confess that it appeared to him to be of rather a drastic nature, because as it stood it was against the entire object of the subsection. He did not know whether it would make any difference to the acceptance of the Amendment by His Majesty's Government if instead of "excessive" restrictions, the word "unnecessary" was put in. That, perhaps, might not be so strong an expression. There might be cases where certain restrictions as to the building went in excess of what was really necessary to carry out a reasonable and proper scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03123"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: This is an Amendment which should not be put on one side without, at any rate, very careful consideration, and in reply to what the noble Earl in charge of the Bill said a moment ago, I am certainly under the impression that on the last occasion the Amendment was not discussed at all. The hour was a rather late one; I think the pangs of hunger were being felt in many parts of the House, and if I remember aright the discussion was somewhat abbreviated on that account. Now we should, I think, bear in mind in considering the proposal of my noble friend that what this subsection deals with is cases where private property is interfered with for the sake of the "amenity" of the area included in the scheme, and surely there is a great difference between an interference with private property in order to produce conditions of amenity, and such interference when the health and well being of the public are involved. I gather that what is intended here is that in order to lay out a particular area in a picturesque and agreeable manner private property may be taken possession of in a somewhat ruthless way. Is it the case that the Bill as it now stands does contain anything which would secure adequate compensation for the sufferer in such circumstances? Might it not, for example, happen that the Committee, thinking entirely of the question of amenity and picturesqueness, would decree that the ground was to be laid out in a particular manner. The person njuriously affected would go before the arbitrator, and is it not conceivable that the arbitrator in his turn would
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0530"/>
<col>1047</col>
say that he could not go behind the scheme approved by the Committee and that although the detriment was undoubtedly great he had no p wer of decreeing compensation in respect of it. I should like to know whether His Majesty's Government really are satisfied that in a case of this kind the Bill as it stands does provide for adequate compensation being given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03124"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> thought that the Amendment ought not to be set on one side quite so lightly as the noble Earl in charge of the Bill treated it, because the clause as it stood was, in his opinion, of a very despotic and absolute character. It said that property should not be deemed to be injuriously affected&#x2014;that was to say, it excluded a man from even attempting to put forward his case to the arbitrator; and, as Lord Lansdowne had just remarked, it was with a view to securing the amenity of the area included. Earl Beauchamp had said that the noble Earl who proposed the Amendment had proposed it twice before. The noble Earl in whose name the Amendment stood was very unlucky in regard to the time it came forward on the first night; it was very late, if he remembered aright; and on the second occasion he did not think it was even discussed at all. The matter itself was really one of very considerable importance. Surely nothing could be milder than the remedy proposed, that if it should appear to the arbitrator that the provisions imposed excessive restrictions upon the property he might award such compensation as he thought just. What was there unreasonable in that? He could not see anything. On the other hand he thought a great deal that was very unreasonable might happen under the clause as it stood, because the whole of a man's property might be taken; on account of amenity he might be told that he was only to erect buildings of a certain height; he might be told that he was only to place a certain number of houses upon the property; and he might be restricted in a way in which his neighbours were not restricted. Why should that be done in the case of A and not in the case of B? Also the whole of his property might be affected in another way. He did not wish to put forward any excessive or unreasonable claim for an owner, but he did think it seemed very hard that an owner was to be absolutely prohibited from placing his case before the arbitrator in any shape or form. If the noble Earl went to a
<col>1048</col>
Division he should certainly vote for the Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03125"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Earl who proposed the Amendment is certainly to be congratulated on the amount of support he is receiving for what is his third attempt to induce your Lordships to accept an Amendment of the kind, and that fact certainly cheers us all in endeavouring to change the minds of your Lordships on this matter. I have been trying to do the same thing myself for five and twenty years but seldom with the success which the noble Earl has met with. But I cannot help feeling that this is a very serious matter, and I am bound to say, and to say at once, that if this Amendment is to be pressed and is to form part of the Bill it will be absolutely impossible for His Majesty's Government to proceed with it. This subsection forms the central idea of town-planning, and if your Lordships have been under the impression all this time that every landowner who in consideration of a town-planning scheme has to give up building thirty houses to the acre is to be compensated for the remaining twenty because he is only allowed to put up ten, I am afraid you have formed a complete misapprehension of what has been intended by His Majesty's Government by this Town Planning Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03126"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> pointed out that the Amendment of the noble Earl did not ask for compensation for an owner because he was only allowed to put up ten houses instead of thirty; all it asked was for the Government to say that he should be allowed to bring the matter before the arbitrator.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03127"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: An arbitrator in a particular case might be of opinion that thirty houses to the acre was a reasonable number, and he might point to various suburbs in which that number and even more might be found. I am afraid it has not been entirely understood that the provisions of this Bill undoubtedly compel owners of building land to sacrifice some possible profits which might be gained from that land in consideration of the public good. In the days in which we now live that sentiment will, perhaps, be regarded as a Socialistic one, but I am afraid it is absolutely at the bottom of this Bill, and if it is to be understood, after a scheme has been passed, especially under the extremely careful safeguards which as the Bill stands at
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0531"/>
<col>1049</col>
present surround the question, an arbitrator is to be permitted to award compensation, which may be on a very large scale indeed if the arbitrator happens to hold those peculiar views, then, as I say, your whole system of town planning is entirely killed. The creation of wide roads, of houses with gardens, by a scheme of such a kind would be made almost impossible, because if the arbitrator happens to be a person who thinks gardens are not necessary, he can undoubtedly point to the fact that three houses of a kind could have been erected on the ground where it was only proposed to put one, and if the landowner is to be compensated for the absence of the remaining two, it may be the proper defence of property, but you must give up town planning, and it would have to remain a luxury for the millionaire. Nobody has ever supposed that you can carry out town planning on strictly commercial lines any more than Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens exist on those lines, and if it is to be made a matter, even a possible matter, of compensation that the uttermost farthing is not being screwed out of any particular acre of land, then, my Lords, I say, do not let us have the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03128"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said the noble Earl had used language of singular exaggeration in the speech he had just addressed to their Lordships, and he doubted whether he had even read the Amendment which he had condemned in such scathing terms. The noble Earl did not appear to see that the proviso was only intended to operate where it appeared to the arbitrator that there were unusual terms in the scheme or terms of excessive severity. The noble Earl said that the Amendment touched the very centre and heart of the Bill, and that unless the clause passed precisely in the form in which the Government had submitted it, town planning was impossible. He entirely protested against any such reading of the Bill. No such consequence would follow in the least. He quite recognised, according to modern ideas, of town planning, that it might be a very proper proceeding to restrict the number of houses to the acre, and he certainly never imagined for a moment that such a restriction as that would come within the terms of his noble friend's Amendment as being either unusual or imposing excessive restrictions on the landowner. The clause as it was drawn went a great
<col>1050</col>
deal further than that; it prevented the arbitrator from giving any compensation whatever terms were imposed by a town-planning scheme. Supposing the proposal was that there should be only one house to the acre, did the noble Earl think it reasonable or equitable that a landowner ought to be compelled to put only one house to the acre and get no compensation?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03129"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It depends on the character of the land. I certainly could not conceive that only one small cottage to the acre would be considered reasonable, but it might suit the landowner and everybody else in certain conditions to have only one house to the acre.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03130"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said that it might or it might not. Supposing a scheme came before a Parliamentary Committee, as it would do as the Bill stood, and there were terms imposed of a very drastic character such as he had indicated, it might be for the amenity of the district. The Committee would say, "We should like to pass this scheme as recommended by the local authority; we think it would be for the amenity of the district." The wretched landowner would say, "If you do that you will ruin me. I bought this land some years ago, intending to make money out of it in a perfectly legitimate and just way. I have raised money on it and mortgaged it, and unless I can develop it on reasonable terms I am ruined." The Committee would reply, "We have nothing to do with the money part of it, we have only to arrange what the scheme is to be and we are told by the Act of Parliament that we are to consider the amenity of the district. We have considered the amenity of the district and we say that one, or two, houses to the acre would be to the amenity of the district considering the particular town." Then the landowner would say, "I must go before the arbitrator." He then went before the arbitrator and asked for compensation. "Oh!" the arbitrator would say, "I do not dispute that you ought to have compensation, but I cannot give it to you; I am prevented by the terms of the Act." It would have a retroactive effect because the Committee being reasonable men would have to consider it, and knowing that the unfortunate landowner would not get compensation, although they knew it
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0532"/>
<col>1051</col>
was for the amenity of the district they would have to throw the scheme out because they would not like to do anything so palpably unjust.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03132"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> said he meant they would have to throw out that provision of the scheme otherwise they would ruin the man, whereas if Parliament allowed the possibility of compensation being given in extreme cases they would pass a scheme which otherwise they would be bound in mercy to throw out.</p>

He did not know what his noble friend would say, but he was quite sure he would not adhere to the strict letter of his Amendment if the Government liked to propose some better words, but that there should be some elastic provision so that the Committee should not be absolutely compelled to pass a scheme under duress knowing that the poor man would not get compensation was, he submitted, eminently demanded by the equities of the case.</p>

There was apparently no limitation as to what the works were which a local authority might be called upon under a

<col>1053</col>
scheme to execute. He did not know whether the noble Earl with his knowledge of the Bill could point to any limiting words, but he knew of none, and they could of course conceive very extensive works being imposed on a local authority. For that reason his noble friend, Viscount St. Aldwyn, in whose name the Amendment also stood, thought that the best way of limiting it would be to limit it to the works which could be imposed for the purpose of housing under the housing part of the Bill. He thought that limitation would be sufficient, but he did not for a moment desire to press the Amendment if the noble Earl did not think it necessary.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03140"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said he was quite willing to admit that there might be a danger on the one side and on the other. There might be the danger which the noble Marquess had just called their Lordships' attention to, but supposing a local authority had agreed to erect a town hall, or a public library, and had failed to carry out their duty. The Amendment of the noble Marquess would prevent them from being compelled to carry out the undertaking which they themselves had agreed to. The local authority having given a public pledge that they would build a public library in a particular place, or a town hall, or surveyors' office, speculators in the neighbourhood might erect houses of a character suitable to surround such public buildings on the understanding that the public buildings would be erected; and supposing those people on the faith of the agreement entered into by the local authority had invested their money and the local authority refused to carry out their agreement, the Amendment of the noble Marquess would prevent them from being compelled to do so. He thought that throughout the discussion there had been a certain confusion in the minds of noble Lords opposite between two kinds of execution&#x2014;to execute it themselves directly, or to give the work out to contract. A great many noble Lords he knew had a prejudice against local authorities executing
<col>1054</col>
these works themselves, but the Amendment of the noble Marquess would also prevent them from letting the work out to contract, and it would therefore be quite impossible for the Local Government Board to secure the proper carrying out of the scheme to which the local authority had agreed perhaps a year or two years before. His Majesty's Government recognised that there was something in what was urged by the noble Marquess, and with that object they had put in an Amendment in subsection (2) of Clause 57, and regretted that they were unable to go further than those words implied. The noble Marquess had asked him whether there was any limitation. He thought that what limitation there was was implied in the various safeguards put into the Bill and the consents which would have to be obtained from the various authorities, and he was of opinion that they might safely rely upon the fact that with the Bill standing as it did at the present time it was very unlikely that a local authority would erect unsuitable buildings, or even if they wished to do so that they would be allowed to do so.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03151"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> moved two new clauses after Clause 76 (Provisions as to land in neighbourhood of royal palaces or parks), applying the provisions of the Bill to land belonging to His Majesty in right of the Crown and in right of the Duchy of Lancaster, but safeguarding them from affecting any royal palace, park, garden, or any right or privilege enjoyed therewith. He said that his Amendment was a very important one, but the position was that it could not be inserted in the Bill without the consent of His Majesty's Government. The noble Earl opposite had very courteously corrected him as to his knowledge of Constitutional practice on the last occasion when the matter was under discussion, and had explained that it was open to him to move the Amendment, and that he was not right in saying it could only be moved by a Member of the Government. Although the noble Earl spoke the truth when he made that observation, he did not speak the whole truth, because it appeared that in substance there was something to be said for his (Lord Salisbury's) humble knowledge of the Constitution since, although the Government might not move it, their assent was essential to an Amendment of the kind. Therefore it lay with His Majesty's Government to assent or otherwise. He would not trouble their
<col>1056</col>
Lordships with another speech on the subject, because he had already addressed them on a former occasion and had been listened to with great patience. He would only add to what he said before that he thought it would be a great mistake if the answer of the Government should be to the effect that his proposed clauses were unnecessary. Would their Lordships throw their minds back for a moment to a discussion which took place a few minutes earlier? The noble Earl who led the House, speaking with great gravity, explained to their Lordships that sacrifices were called for from the owners of land in this country. He said that they would make a great mistake if they imagined that the Bill had been submitted to Parliament and to their Lordships with a view of imposing no sacrifice upon the owners of land, and that at this time of day landowners must be content to make sacrifices in the public interest and that the rights of property must yield to the public interest, as if any of their Lordships had ever contested such a point. The noble Earl dwelt upon that with great emphasis, but there was one class of property in this country which in the opinion of the noble Earl was not going to make any sacrifices, or at least not so far as Parliament could insist upon it&#x2014; that was the property which was administered by the Government themselves. All their Lordships and the landowners throughout the length and breadth of the country were to make sacrifices, but the land administered by the Government was to make none That was the contention of the noble Earl. Did he think that the Government were always ready to make sacrifices when called upon to do so in respect of Government land? Did he think that his colleagues who had the various Crown lands to administer were willing to make sacrifices when sacrifices were called for? Had he any grounds for thinking so? Not long ago at a conference presided over by the President of the Board of Agriculture, a question arose as to small holdings on Crown, lands. There was no clause such as he was submitting in the Small Holdings Act. In that Act, whatever sacrifices were imposed upon property-owners in England were not imposed by law upon the Crown lands, and at that conference it was suggested that some small parcel of land, he thought 150 acres, should be taken from a large Crown farm of some 3,000 acres for the purpose of small holdings. That
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0535"/>
<col>1057</col>
application was refused, and the matter was brought before the President of the Board of Agriculture, who reminded the deputation that no land could be taken compulsorily from the Duchy of Cornwall or from the Duchy of Lancaster, so that the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, at any rate appeared to be fully conscious of the privileged position in which Crown lands stood; and he gathered from that authority that the 150 acres were not given up by the Duchy of Lancaster for small holdings. He suggested that the same mistake should not be made again, and that it should be admitted by the Government themselves in the Bill they had brought forward in the public interest that the land they administered should be under the same obligations as the land belonging to other people. Of course, the Crown lands he was referring to were not the lands in the occupation of His Majesty, because His Majesty st od absolutely in a position apart. The Crown lands he was speaking of were the lands administered by the Government, and had nothing to do with the Crown except in name. He submitted the proposed new clauses to His Majesty's Government, and if they refused to accept them the responsibility would lie upon the Government and they would hear of it from every part of England.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03158"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess concluded his speech with a threat at which I must confess I am not terrified. The matter is not altogether so simple a one as he appears to think, and even his object, which he has frankly admitted, of attempting to make some Party capital out of it may not prove quite so easy an achievement as he imagines. There is much to be said as regards a certain part of the lands which are lumped together under the designation of Crown lands for making the provisions of this Bill applicable to them in some form, although, as your Lordships will have gathered from the speech of the noble Marquess, there is no precedent for doing anything of the kind. But we are in a somewhat special difficulty in this instance, in that we do not know what form this Bill will ultimately take if it ever passes into law, as to which I confess I am somewhat sceptical. If it ever does, it will pass after the Bill, as amended by your Lordships, has proceeded to another place and after the Amendments have been considered there. Therefore, we on this Bench cannot say in what form the Bill will ultimately become law, and to what authority or tribunal we should be submitting the Crown if we were to accept the noble Marquess's Amendment. In, practice, there has been no difference in treatment as between the different kinds of Crown lands, and for that reason I think Clause 78 as proposed by the noble Marquess relating to land belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall is not necessary. It has never been the custom, I fancy, to treat the lands of the Duchy of Cornwall otherwise than as part of the Crown lands pure and simple, and there is no reason for making a special provision with regard to them. But when the noble Marquess
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0536"/>
<col>1059</col>
says that the Crown lands have no reference to the occupant of the Throne, or the Heir to the Throne, I think he is not speaking with complete accuracy, because, so far as the two Duchies are concerned, those Duchies and the income derived from them undoubtedly form part of the arrangement which exists between the occupant of the Throne on the one hand and the country on the other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03159"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I agree; I overstated the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03160"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Therefore this, I think, would of itself account for the fact where leave has been given, as, for instance, in the Act which the noble Marquess mentioned of last year, to lease land, power is given in the one case to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster acting on behalf of His Majesty's Government, and in the other to the Duke of Cornwall to proceed under the Act. What the noble Marquess proposes is to place all Crown lands, not merely those which I have mentioned, but all others, in precisely the same position as lands in private ownership. But it has occurred to him that it would not be wise to allow lands needed, for instance, for the defence of the country to be treated precisely as if they belonged to one of your Lordships. Clearly if there was a question of taking Dover Harbour or Salisbury Plain for some purposes of improvement, it is right that the Admiralty and the Army Council should have some voice in the matter. The noble Marquess has considered that, but with this curious result; that wherever in any part of England it is proposed to take any piece of Crown land, say in the very heart of the Midlands, the leave of those Departments has to be asked in any particular case for fear of interfering with something which at one time or another they might require. The noble Marquess has forgotten that there are other Government Departments also concerned. There is, for instance, the Post Office. It would be a very serious matter, I think, if the Postmaster-General were placed in precisely the same position as any private owner if it were a question with regard to some land which he may require, or believes that he might require. The fact is, and I quite admit it, it is not easy to draw a marked line of distinction between what ought to be the ratepayers' interest pure and simple, of which the
<col>1060</col>
noble Marquess is thinking, and, on the other hand, the interest of the taxpayers in matters of this kind, and if there was any means of holding an absolutely fair balance between the two it would be desirable to arrive at it. But, my Lords, I cannot think that in practice any hardship or difficulty will arise if these proposed new clauses do not appear in the Bill. After all, the administration of Crown lands, part of them represented by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, is worked in the light of day; and what, for instance, did the somewhat invidious matter raised by the noble Marquess mean? Everyone knows that the President of the Board of Agriculture has devoted the Crown lands so far as he could to the purposes of the Agricultural Holdings Act, and yet the noble Marquess has brought forward one single instance, mentioning it simply <i>ad invidiam</i>, where for some reason a particular slice of a particular Crown farm could not be given for the purpose of small holdings, and he makes the best case he can of it. Although I quite admit in theory that it might be well if Crown lands were all subjected to the same rule, yet in practice I do not believe that any difficulty or detriment to the objects of the Bill will occur from their not being placed under it. I say the same with regard to the administration of the lands of the Duchy of Lancaster and of the lands of the Duchy of Cornwall. Both those great estates are, I believe, admirably administered, and if a case should arise where the managers of either one of them were called upon to join in a town-planning scheme, I think all your Lordships will agree that it is altogether inconceivable to suppose they would place in the way of such a scheme the kind of obstruction which some private owners of land, though I think but few, might be disposed to place in the way. Therefore, although as a pure matter of theory, I am not without sympathy for the noble Marquess's objects, yet we see such difficulties in practice, whether it be in the relation between the particular Departments and Parliament, or particular Departments one with the other, that His Majesty's Government do not feel able to advise His Majesty to give his assent to the Amendment proposed by the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03161"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> said that their Lordships were, of course, powerless in the matter, and although he had listened with
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0537"/>
<col>1061</col>
the greatest respect to the interesting speech of the noble Earl, he confessed with great humility that it did not seem to him to have anything to do with the merits of the particular matter their Lordships were discussing. He did not admit that any uncertainty as to the ultimate form the Bill would take need deter their Lordships from dealing with the matter. What they desired to know was whether, if the Bill stood in the shape in which it left their Lordships' house, there was any reason why Crown lands should not be included. The object of the Bill was, first the housing of the working classes, and they could not include a bit of Crown land in a scheme or proposal for the housing of the working classes under the Bill because the Bill did not apply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03162"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: By compulsion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03163"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> agreed; but no Crown land could be included or scheduled for the purpose of a town-planning scheme. Could anybody suggest that any Government Department could be injured or jeopardised, or the interest of Crown lands jeopardised, by a power to include Crown lands in the scheme and to propose to bring them under the working of the scheme? The noble Earl had told them he did not suppose that there would be the same sort of obstructions placed in the way or objections raised by Government Departments to town-planning schemes as would happen in the case of, he said at first private owners, but corrected that and said, by a few private landowners. He believed that it was not a question of objections being raised; it was a question of the inability of the machinery in the Act to include for the purpose of consideration Crown lands; and it appeared to him, that being so, that all the beneficent provisions of the Bill with regard to the housing of the working classes and town-planning schemes would in many parts of the country be crippled and fettered by the fact that the proposers of them could not include Crown lands. If the Bill stood, much improved as he believed it to be to-day, he saw no reason why Crown lands should not be included, and he would therefore ask the noble Earl, even at the eleventh hour, to consider whether His Majesty's Government could not themselves frame a clause which would remove what would be a very great blot on the Bill. There were large areas in towns and in other districts&#x2014; he could name some to
<col>1062</col>
his own knowledge&#x2014;where Crown lands could be usefully brought under the Bill and great public advantage be thereby derived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03164"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: His Majesty's Government are, of course, masters of the situation, but I venture to say that we are by no means satisfied that a conclusive case has been made against my noble friend's Amendment. We are, of course, talking not about Royal parks and palaces but of Crown lands administered by public Departments very much in the same way as other lands are administered by private owners, and we can see no reason why such lands should be exempted from the operations of such an Act as this. What were the reasons adduced by the noble Earl opposite for so doing and against the Amendment of my noble friend? He suggests to your Lordships that this Bill is not likely to become law as it leaves your Lordships' House and that certain Amendments which might affect the position of the Crown lands may be expected. What Amendments has the noble Earl in his mind? What Amendments could make it desirable that Crown lands should not be placed under restrictions similar to those which affect the lands of private owners? I fail to conceive what the noble Earl has in his mind. Then he said, "If you add this clause to the Bill you will find yourselves in a difficult position with regard to certain classes of Crown lands, lands owned by the Admiralty or by the War Office, or by the Post Office." I am quite sure that my noble friend would have been delighted to insert words in his clause which would have provided exceptional treatment for lands in those particular categories. The noble Earl suggested that our proposal was without precedent. I should like to refer him to the 30th section of the Small Holders (Scotland) Bill of last year. The section is a very short one, and I will read it in full:&#x2014;
<quote>"This Act shall apply to all Crown lands."</quote>
That seems to me to be a case in point. We are, of course, helpless in this matter, and if noble Lords opposite cannot see their way to accept this Amendment we must bow to their decision, but we think the refusal is eminently unreasonable.</membercontribution></p>

Through the courtesy of the noble Marquess he hid been given particulars of it, and he saw that it did not refer to his Department at all, but to the Duchy of Lancaster. He would look into the matter, however, and as there would be a discussion on this subject in two or three days he had not the smallest doubt that he would then be in a position to give a perfectly satisfactory answer with regard to the point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03166"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It has been suggested by the noble and learned Lord (the Lord Chief Justice) that town-planning schemes would be frustrated by reason of there being no compulsory powers in the Act to deal with Crown lands. Of course, schemes can be brought forward so far as all other lands are concerned including Crown lands subject to the consent of the Department concerned, and everybody knows perfectly well that no public Department, unless for some imperative public reason, would withhold their consent, and the assumption that all schemes would be frustrated unless Crown lands are included in the Bill is, I am afraid, rather a dismal one. My noble and learned friend in nearly every speech he has made in the course of the discussion on this Bill has assured your Lordships of his sincere and earnest and anxious desire to further this Bill. I always accept everything my noble and learned friend says with full confidence in its sincerity, but I must say we have found views in every way opposed to ours and in a way that we think is really not in favour of supporting the principles of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I believe if the Bill is really worked out it will prove the most expensive one to the ratepayers that ever has been passed by Parliament. Of course, it is impossible to say what this expense will be. It is not more than possible to conjecture to what an extent the Bill will be carried into effect, but, at all events, it will make a very heavy charge upon the rates, and it will make a much heavier charge than has been made by the Housing Acts up to the present time. The reason of that is that this Bill for the first time makes Part III. of the Act&#x2014; or what may be called housing schemes and town-planning schemes&#x2014; compulsory in every part of the country. How far those schemes may be carried out of course it is impossible to say at present, but as the Bill was originally introduced it was proposed to place in the hands of the Local Government Board an absolute control over the expenditure of rates&#x2014; an absolute power to order county councils to do anything that might seem good in the pleasure of the Department, and, although your
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0539"/>
<col>1065</col>
Lordships during the passage of this Bill have placed a certain control upon the Department, yet, at the same time, great powers of enforcing expenditure on local authorities are still to be found in the Bill. That is one point.<lb/>
Another point is the manner in which this charge is going to be spread over all the districts. The charge as stated in Clause 30, save in certain exceptional cases at the discretion of the Local Government Board, is to be spread over the whole area of the district, quite irrespective of the needs for schemes in particular parts of the district, quite irrespective of the outlay made by different owners and of the conditions of various properties. It is quite possible that a housing scheme may be proposed in a district a considerable portion of which is already in a very good condition, but which will nevertheless be charged for benefits which will be reaped by their neighbours alone, and who very likely themselves have entirely neglected their duties in regard to matters of housing. That seems to me a very serious thing; but, more than that, it is, of course, very unfair to what one may describe as good owners&#x2014; men who have laid out large sums on their cottages. I am speaking mainly of the rural districts, which will now be called upon to pay for their neighbours who have neglected their duties.<lb/>
But let me point out one result which is quite certain to happen, and that is that all private trade in building cottages will be stopped for good and all. I am not now speaking of owners, but of the private trade of building, because builders will say, "This is not a very lucrative business, and now that houses are to be built on the security of the rates and at the expense of the rates, on terms and conditions which cannot manifestly be remunerative, it is impossible for us to enter into competition, and therefore we shall withdraw altogether and have nothing whatever to do with the business." Even private landowners will be discouraged very much from building cottages, because they will say, "Suppose I build my cottages, I shall in addition be called upon to contribute in the rates to the building of other people's cottages." I think that these circumstances are really very deplorable, and your Lordships may depend upon it that these effects will
<col>1066</col>
follow as sure as your Lordships pass this Bill.<lb/>
In conclusion, I cannot help saying one word with regard to the absolute carelessness of this Government as to expenditure on the rates. This Government have been more regardless of expenditure generally than any Government I can recall. It is quite sufficient for them that an object in itself is good, and as to where the money comes from they do not seem to care. In one or two instances, such as old age pensions, they did not even attempt to consider beforehand where the money was to come from, and as to their calculations we know what they came to. But in regard to this matter of rates they have been, and are, especially careless. It is quite sufficient for them that housing and town planning are good things. They do not seem to have paused to consider what the effect upon the rates will be. I could give your Lordships plenty of instances. Take such a case as that of the medical inspection of children. Well, that is a very good thing, immediately it is placed on the rates, but when you attempt to get anything from the Government you are unsuccessful&#x2014;at all events, up to the present time we have got nothing. Take such a case as the tuberculosis case which your Lordships had before you the other day. Everybody knows it is very desirable to get rid of tuberculosis. Immediately the Government proposed to place the cost upon the rates, but as soon as it was represented to them that some of it ought to come from the taxes, then at once the Government admitted they had not thought of the thing, and really for the present could tell us nothing. I am not going to detain your Lordships any longer, but it seems to me these charges are increasing until they become almost intolerable, and if this Act is really carried out&#x2014; and, remember, the burden will be so heavy that that is a circumstance which will weigh very heavily against the Act being fairly carried out&#x2014; but if it is carried out the ratepayer will suffer a burden heavier than any he has hitherto been called upon to bear.</membercontribution></p>

Clause 3 provides for the payment of a fourth Assistant Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, and Clause 4 enables the provisions of the Superannuation Act to be applied to the clerical staff.

Your Lordships will see that this really does not come within the scope or title of the Bill. The Bill is an Act to amend the Metropolitan Police Acts, and to make better provision for the widows and children of constables who lose the r lives in the execution of their duty. The only inference from that is that it is limited to those constables. There is not a word said about Scotland in the Bill, and it has absolutely eluded the notice of the Scottish county councils and everybody in Scotland. The Scottish Police Acts are separate Acts affecting Scotland only, and I cannot imagine anything more inconvenient than to introduce into a Bill dealing with the Metropolitan Police a clause which deals with the Scottish Police. I believe that the Royal Burghs have already called the attention of the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland to this and represented the inconvenience of it. They said that they had only just discovered that this provision existed in the Bill. It seems to me wholly beyond the scope of the Bill, and I

On the other hand, the Home Secretary has admitted that on certain points affected by this Bill the London County Council and the ratepayers of London have some claim on the Government, and I dare say at a later stage of the Bill the noble Earl will allow me to address a few words to him on this matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03203">Amendments <i>reported</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03204"><member>Viscount MIDLETON</member> moved an Amendment to Clause 6&#x2014;
<quote>6. The provisions of this Act shall apply in the case of a county borough as if the borough council were a county council, and the expenses of the borough council shall be defrayed out of the borough fund or borough rate,</quote>
to substitute for "county borough," "borough or urban district." The object of the Amendment, he thought, would be appreciated by the noble Earl the Lord Steward. It certainly seemed absurd that
<col>1070</col>
in matters of this description, which were precisely similar to others in which the non-county boroughs and the urban district councils were accustomed to exercise jurisdiction, the whole of these licences should have to be granted by the county council. In some cases the county council was nearly fifty miles away, and it would be practically almost impossible to make these applications without great expense. A large number of the urban district councils had over 10,000 inhabitants and were certainly competent for this purpose. He did not know whether the noble Earl or their Lordships would care to have a list of the number of similar services they had to perform. It had been pointed out to him that in a borough, for instance, such as Harrogate, which was now an enormous town, they would be forced to go as far as Wakefield to make application in order to hold a cinematograph exhibition in the former town. All the buildings were under the local council, and in regard to them assuredly the local council must have a knowledge which the county council could not pretend to. Therefore, he moved the Amendment in his name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03205">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 3, line 8, to leave out 'county,' and after 'borough' insert 'or urban district,' and after the first 'council' to insert or urban district council.'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Midleton.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03206"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said there was no doubt that at the present time under the Bill the county councils had power to delegate direct to non-county boroughs or to the magistrates. What some people required was that the power should be given direct to the non-county councils and that they should be made under this Bill the licensing authority. There were reasons, however, why it was desired that the county councils should keep this power of delegation, because there were circumstances under which it was better that they should delegate it, not to the councils, but to the magistrates. For this reason Part IV of the Public Health Act, 1890, put the control of the music-hall licence into the hands of the magistrates. That had been adopted in a large number of cases, and it was thought that the licensing of cinematograph exhibitions should be in the hands of the same licensing authority. It would create a great deal of confusion if the licensing of music halls were done by one authority and the licensing of the cinematograph by another
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0542"/>
<col>1071</col>
authority. That was really the point between the noble Viscount and His Majesty's Government. If the noble Viscount did not press the Amendment it would be still within the power of the county council to delegate to the non-county borough councils, but they retained the alternative and the option of delegating to the magistrates. Although, generally speaking, it was not unlikely that it would be given to the borough councils, they desired the power to delegate to the magistrates for the sake of uniformity in certain districts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03207"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Would that power of delegation equally extend to urban district councils?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03208"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member> said that arose before, and he thought that the Government, in answer to the noble Viscount's question, were able to say that there was no doubt at all about this question of delegation. As shortly as he could put it, it was this. In Clause 5 the existing powers of the county council to delegate were expressly preserved for the purpose of the Bill, and the last words of the Clause dealt with the delegation of powers under the Bill to magistrates.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03209"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said he had no right to speak again but with the permission of their Lordships he would say that there was considerable feeling about this matter, and he had had a large correspondence.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03210"><member>LORD BELPER</member> ventured to think that probably the county councils would be averse to giving authority to borough or urban district councils, but, at all events, if the matter was left over till the Third Reading no doubt his noble friend, if he

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03222"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member> said he was in a little difficulty as to the best manner in which to put the Amendments which appeared on the Paper since their Lordships last considered this Bill. They all consisted of leaving out a part of the Bill; some left out more and some left out less of the Bill. Lord MacDonnell proposed to leave out the whole of Part IV. They had not come to that yet, but another noble Lord moved to leave out particular clauses. He thought it would be convenient that he should in the usual way put each separate clause, and then their Lordships could discuss whether the clause should stand, or whether it should be struck out of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03223"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said that at the last sitting of their Lordships' House he was dealing with the question of congestion, and one of the proposals that he made was that power should be given to the Lord Lieutenant to include or to exclude any electoral division. He had no desire to increase largely the area under the jurisdiction of the Congested Districts Board, but it had been found in practice that areas or parishes, not the full extent of an electoral district, perhaps, but areas and parishes, were so circumstanced that it was desirable to extend to them the beneficial operations of the Board. It had long been his opinion that when a particular area had been dealt with by the Congested Districts Board and the estates within it had been improved, it was no longer desirable to retain that area under the Board's jurisdiction and to spend money in it which might with greater advantage be spent in other areas which had not received attention from the Board. Think-
<col>1074</col>
ing over the matter in the interval, he had come to the conclusion that it would be desirable that the Lord Lieutenant should have the power, but running with it there should be strict precaution against it being used for large or indefinite extension of the congested area. That precaution, he thought, would be sufficiently provided by making the action of the Lord Lieutenant subject to the advice of the Privy Council. He therefore moved to insert after Clause 54 the amended new clause standing in his name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03224">Amendment moved&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03225"><member>THE EARL OF LEITRIM</member> said this Amendment was very similar to one moved by Lord Midleton on a previous occasion, and which was postponed until Report. He asked if the noble Lord would accept the insertion, after the word "time" in the first line, of the words "on representation in the prescribed form from the Congested Districts Board."</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03227"><member>THE EARL OF LEITRIM</member> said that if the noble Lord would accept those words, noble Lords on his side of the House would be inclined to agree.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03228"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> thought the noble Lord had framed this new clause with an anxious desire to meet the difficulties of the case, and in it they had had the benefit of the noble Lord's great knowledge. This clause practically followed a reference to an earlier Act, but there was one change or omission that ought to be noted. The earlier clause said within twelve months. That was the limit of time fixed. He did not know whether the noble Lord had
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0544"/>
<col>1075</col>
considered that fully; he had not himself considered it, but he thought it needed consideration whether some limit of time should not be put in the Bill. It was not contemplated that for all time there would be a series of congested districts in Ireland and that they would require to be dealt with by Orders in Council by the Lord Lieutenant.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03229"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said he had thought of it, and the matter had been referred to also by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, on the last day, but he did not think it desirable to impose any limit of time. He was not opposed, however, to accepting a limit of time if the noble Lord thought it necessary. He would not object to accepting, say, a limit of five years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03230"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he would like to consider the point before Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03231"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> said that on this point he would suggest to Lord MacDonnell and Lord Ashbourne that it would hardly be desirable to have a limit of time as regards exclusions, but it might be desirable to have a limit of time for inclusions and to extend the area. For the purposes of contracting the area, however, it seemed to him most important that there should be no limit of time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03232"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: We do not oppose this Amendment, because, owing to the action of your Lordships' House in having restored the congested districts to their present limited area, we should regard any possible extension of them as an improvement. At the same time, I am not quite certain from the reading of this new clause what it is my noble friend exactly desires to do, and my doubt is not solved by the references to the Act of 1891. The Act of 1891. Section 36, subsection (2) runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided if within one year from the passing of this Act it appears to the Congested Districts Board that it is expedient to include in the operation of this section any electoral division other than the divisions hereinbefore mentioned or to exclude therefrom any electoral division it shall be lawful for the Lord Lieutenant to include or exclude as the case may be."</quote>
Was that really meant to meet the case of some division to which the thirty shillings limit applied which might have been
<col>1076</col>
overlooked within the twelve months, or did it mean that any division might have been included whether the thirty shillings limit applied or not? I do not know. We were not in office during those twelve months, and I do not quite realise what the powers of the Lord Lieutenant during that time actually were. If, as it seems possible to read it, any electoral division or any part thereof other than the divisions already scheduled as congested means "any" division, the noble Lord's Amendment would enable the Lord Lieutenant to put back our scheme in the Bill. If he does not mean that, I confess I do not know exactly what he does mean. Is it meant to meet the case of a division which becomes poorer, and therefore more congested, and falls within the thirty shillings limit? I should have hoped that that was now a very unlikely thing to happen. If not, I fail to see what case it is intended to apply to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03233"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said it would apply to the cases to which the noble Earl first referred. That was to say, it would be an extension of the power given in the Act of 1891. He quite saw afterwards, on reflection, that it would be open to the extension which the noble Earl had mentioned, and in order to prevent that extension, which he thought would not be desirable, he had hedged the matter round by requiring the advice of the Privy Council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03234"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he had had something to do with the drafting of the 1891 Act and he could not but think that the noble Lord had misunderstood it. The test of a congested district was a somewhat rough one, and when that Bill was passed it was thought that there might be some places which were not really fit subjects for the Congested Districts Board. On the other hand, it was felt that that rough test might exclude places which it might be desirable to have brought within the jurisdiction of the Board. That was the real object of the words in the 1891 Act.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03246"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> pointed out that compulsory purchase would be exercised according to the proposal of Lord MacDonnell, on the requisition of the Congested Districts Board, and as he read Lord MacDonnell's Amendment he would restrict the Board from disposing of land so acquired to anybody but congests who held uneconomic farms. The last two lines on page 27 of the Bill (Clause 55, subsection (I)) would apply to any land however acquired, and would enable them to dispose of it in the way pointed out in the later part of the section&#x2014;namely, after the congests had been dealt with, to any person who might desire to have it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03247">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03248"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved an Amendment providing that if parcels of land could not advantageously be sold to tenants or proprietors the Congested Districts Board might sell them to "whomsoever they think fit, having regard to the welfare of the locality." He said he was anxious to give the Congested Districts Board a wider discretion indisposing of these remnants of land than the section as it stood would give. He had in his mind the case of a demesne, the plantations and gardens, and so on. The Congested Districts Board bought a whole property and proceeded to dispose of the agricultural land, having on its hands for disposal afterwards the demesne. Now it frequently happened that the Board got a very good price for a demesne, and people who would be of great advantage and an acquisition to the neighbourhood came and bought the demesne and the mansion and settled down there. If they limited this subclause as appeared in the Bill, the Board would have to divide up the desmene and the plantations and the gardens, and so on, amongst the sons of tenants or proprietors of holdings not exceeding &#x00A3;10 rateable value. It was undesirable that compulsion of that sort should be exercised over the Congested Districts Board, and he thought they should be given discretion to dispose of the demesne land and of any remnants of the agricultural land in the manner which was most suitable. They should remember that the Congested Districts Board consisted of responsible men who knew what was necessary and desirable for the countryside, and in a small matter of this,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0546"/>
<col>1079</col>
description he thought it undesirable to fetter their discretion by unnecessary limitations.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03250"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that if this section merely meant to empower the Congested Districts Board to get rid of demesnes and other parcels of land which they might have upon their hands and which they had not been able to dispose of to tenants, there would be no objection to it; but he had great apprehension that the land would be disposed of to, landless men, because the subsection read&#x2014;
<quote>"If any parcels of such land are not required for, or having regard to the circumstances of the estate, land, or district cannot advantageously be sold to, such tenants or proprietors, the Board may sell those parcels to any sons of tenants or proprietors of holdings situated in a congested districts county and not exceeding ten pounds in rateable value."</quote>
He apprehended it would be quite possible for the Congested Districts Board to say, "There are numbers of tenants with uneconomic holdings in this district, but there is terrible turbulence due to the dissatisfaction of landless men. It is to the advantage of the district to satisfy their hunger, and therefore we shall dispose of the land to them." If the clause could be carried in such a way that land was not to be sold to landless men under that pretext, he would be very glad to support Lord MacDonnell; but he thought that between this and Report it ought to be considered whether it might not be necessary to guard in some way against that possibility. The composition of the Congested Districts Board had been changed, so that something like what he feared would be possible.</p>

The noble Lord intimated that he had another Amendment to move to substitute the word "five" instead of the word "ten" in the last line of the subsection. He said they had heard a great deal about the amount of land which was necessary to relieve congestion, and therefore he though it desirable that the limits of the increase of these new holdings should be clearly stated. Consequently he proposed that they should not exceed &#x00A3;10 in reteable value. That they had been told was the minimum, though he did not agree with it, but still it had been taken as the minimum for a congested holding. He did not absolutely mean that if a portion of a field was to be included and would make it over &#x00A3;10 it would be necessary to divide that field and cut it up, but the general idea was that it should be not exceeding &#x00A3;10 in rateable value. He would be very glad to accept the word "approximately," if His Majesty's Government thought they could accept his Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03258"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said he was not at all sure that there was not some confusion as to these "tens." There were three tens mentioned in the Bill, but there was no distinction kept between them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03259"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> suggested that it would be quite impossible to work this provision with the Amendment, for the very reason that the valuer might come down and find that a holding exceeded the ten pounds, and consequently the whole thing would be a failure. Therefore, they would have to make their case as to the value at the time the holding was created. He suggested that after the word "shall" in the Amendment the following words should be added "so far as can be reasonably estimated at the time of such creation or enlargement." It would then read, "Provided that no such holding thereby created or enlarged shall, so far as can be reasonably estimated at the time of such creation or enlargement, be made to exceed ten pounds in rateable value."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03260"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> said he was quite willing to accept the suggestion of his noble and learned friend.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03261"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: May I say one word as to the clause as it stands, irrespective of the Amendment? I confess I am a little puzzled as to the intention of the clause itself. This, as I understand it, is a clause enabling the Congested Districts Board to deal with what may be described as remanets after the wants of the people have
<col>1082</col>
been supplied. The clause says that these remanets may be given to the sons of tenants or proprietors whose holdings do not exceed ten pounds in rateable value. That is to say, the son of a man whose holding is valued at &#x00A3;9 may receive a remanet, but the son of an adjoining tenant whose valuation is &#x00A3;10 10<i>s.</i> may not receive a remanet. I confess that this seems to be a very extraordinary proposal. I quite understand that the &#x00A3;10 limit should have been created for the purposes of the Bill as a convenient definition of the uneconomic holding which has to be made up to an economic value, but here you seem to introduce a most extraordinary and arbitrary distinction between the sons of two occupiers of land, both of them living in very much the same circumstances, and neither more nor less entitled, the one than the other, to consideration under this clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03262"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said that in addition to what the noble Marquess has just said, this clause was entirely inconsistent with Cause 17, because that clause said that any advance should be made to purchase a holding for a person being the son of a tenant or proprietor of a holding. That was one son of one tenant. This clause would enable them to give a holding to any number of sons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03263"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I may perhaps point out to the noble and learned Lord that the limitation to the sons of small tenants is not new, because it exists in more than one place in the 1903 Act. Section 2 of that Act referred to "the tenant of a holding and a person being tenant or proprietor of a holding not exceeding &#x00A3;5 of rateable value situate in the neighbourhood of an estate." Again in Section 75, where the Board purchases land they may "sell any parcels thereof not required for tenants or holdings in that county to any tenants or proprietors whose holdings do not exceed &#x00A3;5 in rateable value." There is thus an absolute analogy, only it is a &#x00A3;5 limit instead of &#x00A3;10.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03264"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> said it was very easy to get confused over this, although it was plain enough after what the noble Earl had said.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03371"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said it would be in their Lordships' recollection that at an earlier part of the debate he withdrew an Amendment which
<col>1094</col>
stood in his name under Clause 14 of the Bill and promised the noble Earl the Leader of the House to bring it up later. He now took the opportunity of fulfilling his promise. The whole question of compulsion naturally came up on this point. Their Lordships had already negatived the proposals for general compulsion, and he had narrowed down the general proposal to one for compulsion for the relief of congestion. It was in connection with that more narrow proposal that he withdrew his Amendment, as it appeared that the debate was not going very favourably from his point of view. He now reproduced it in the shape of compulsion, if they called it compulsion, for the relief of congestion in those administrative counties which contained congested areas. It was manifest that if the Congested Districts Board did not get possession of the grass lands in the West of Ireland any attempt to relieve congestion there was foredoomed to failure. The ill-success of the Congested Districts Board in the way of enlarging holdings was due altogether to their inability to obtain sufficient grass lands to which to migrate the people from the more congested areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03372">It had been stated in the course of this debate that the Congested Districts Board need have no difficulty in obtaining grass lands if they would only give an adequate price for them, and small importance had been by many of their Lordships attached to the figures which were given in another place showing that the efforts of the Board to come to terms with the landlords in the West of Ireland had proved a failure. He willingly admitted that the landlords in the West were anxious to sell their lands at a price. He willingly admitted also that the Congested Districts Board was anxious to buy those lands at the highest price it could give consistently with retaining a sufficient sum of money to spend on the relief of congestion; but the truth was that in the West of Ireland there was established what he might call a corner in land. The landlords were willing to sell but only at their own price, and no person had had more means of judging that than himself. He did not blame the landlords by any means. He thought they were perfectly justified in holding out for the highest price they could get, but their holding out for the price which they wanted had resulted in the complete stoppage of sales to the Board.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0554"/>
<col>1095</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03373">The Congested Districts Board, in the last two years with which he was connected with it, had endeavoured to acquire grass lands in Connaught, and in the last year that he had anything to do with the Board they made a great attempt to get possession of a large quantity of grass lands. In his efforts to bring about bargains he was greatly assisted by a gentleman whose name was well known to noble Lords opposite, the O'Conor Don, who was animated by a desire to bring the Congested Districts Board as closely as possible into touch with the landlords and in that way to avoid the necessity of anything like compulsion. But the result of all his efforts, and the result of the efforts of the Board, was the purchase of, he thought, &#x00A3;97,000 or &#x00A3;98,000 worth of land. Both parties wanted to deal; the landlords wanted to sell, and the Board wanted to buy. They could not come to a bargain, the result being that things remained as they were at present. Congestion would remain unrelieved and the misery which they all deplored in the West of Ireland would continue unless some means were taken whereby both parties could be brought to an understanding. They might call it compulsion. He preferred to call it arbitration. He suggested to noble Lords the establishment of a tribunal beyond all suspicion as regards impartiality and competence, to which when both parties failed to come to a bargain their difficulties might be referred as to an impartial and thoroughly competent tribunal. Noble Lords might call that compulsion, but in his view it was another name for arbitration. He proposed that this tribunal, which would be substantially a judicial body, should be established, and that when both parties could not come to an agreement the matter should be laid before this tribunal whose award should be final.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03374">The scheme which he put forward and the scheme which Lord Atkinson put forward had a great resemblance in important details. They both approached the question with the wish to bring the landlords and the Congested Districts Board together. Both were animated by a desire to relieve congestion, and by a desire to give the landlord a really fair price for his land. Lord Atkinson differed from him in looking at the matter from a more legal point of view than he did, or was competent to do, while per
<col>1096</col>
sonally he looked at the matter, in accordance with his past training, more from an administrative point of view. As to the relative merits of the two, schemes, it was not for him to say. It was for their Lordships to decide; but he-trusted, at all events, that they would see that it was only by means of one of these schemes that this long dispute between the Congested Districts Board on the one side and the landlords in the West of Ireland on the other could be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. He begged their Lordships, however, not to look into the matter from a too critical point of view, but from the point of view of men who were anxious, to settle a long-standing dispute, and he hoped they would bring to bear upon it that consideration for the people in the West of Ireland by which from his personal acquaintance with some of their Lordships he knew they were actuated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03375"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he supposed it; would be more convenient if he now shortly detailed the scheme which he had taken the opportunity of putting on the Paper. He apprehended that the noble Lord disapproved as much as he did the extraordinary scheme embodied in the Bill, a scheme which was unique in the history of the compulsory acquisition of land in every part of the British Empire, and had only its analogue in the provisions of the Evicted Tenants Act of two years ago. The scheme was that two individuals without consulting anybody or satisfying anybody or applying to anybody, could, according to the counsels of their own will and of their own motion, expropriate some person from his land without appeal. The procedure was unheard of. While he had every confidence in Mr. Justice Wylie as an able, honest, impartial man, he maintained that in such a matter as the fixing of land value they were placing him in a position of hopeless difficulty when they associated him with two assessors. Personally he did not like assessors in any form, and it would be impossible for Mr. Justice Wylie, after suggesting a certain price as being the proper one to fix, to overrule the opinion of two experts sitting beside him. He could not say to them, "You who may be assumed to be judges of land, have come to a wrong conclusion, and I have come to a right conclusion." Personally he thought it would be better to allow
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0555"/>
<col>1097</col>
Mr. Justice Wylie to act on his own responsibility, moved by the light he would derive from the evidence that would be given before him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03376">The difference between the noble Lord's proposal and his own was a great deal deeper than the noble Lord seemed to suggest. The difference between the noble Lord's scheme and his was this&#x2014;that no one outside the Estates Commission was to judge of the necessity of compulsion. He agreed with many of his noble friends in thinking that compulsion should never be resorted to unless it was necessary. He had, therefore, carefully provided in his Amendment that it should not be resorted to unless it was proved to be necessary before the tribunal that he proposed to set up. In his opinion it was the duty of the Government to satisfy the House that compulsion was necessary before they took the powers to compel. If the Government did not discharge that duty was there no obligation resting on their Lordships? If it was necessary that compulsory power should be given to secure relief of congestion, would their Lordships deny it because the Government had failed to assure the House that it was necessary? But by his scheme compulsion could not be exercised until it was proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal that it was necessary it should be exercised in order to obtain the land that was wanted. He followed the precedent of the Small Holdings Act, and suggested that where the Estates Commission were unable to obtain land for the relief of congestion by voluntary agreement at a reasonable price they must propose a scheme. The scheme would come before two Estates commissioners and the Judicial Commissioner, and if they thought that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been made out in respect of congestion they would serve notices of compulsion and make inquiries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03377">The tribunal would be composed of a Judge from the superior Courts taken from the rota as under the Evicted Tenants Act, and one of the Estates Commissioners, and if that tribunal were not adequate to decide cases impartially he had no objection to some addition. But he had a great objection to the provision in the noble Lord's Amendment that special Judges should be nominated by the Lord Lieutenant to preside. The first business of the tribunal was to decide whether com-
<col>1098</col>
pulsion was necessary at all, and the burden rested on the Estates Commission to show that it was necessary. In addition, he gave an appeal on all questions of law and on mixed questions of law and fact. He did not think that the Appeal Court was a suitable tribunal to decide questions of fact alone. It was necessary that they should have power to decide mixed questions of law and fact, because questions of pure law would seldom arise. But if noble Lords thought it necessary that they should have jurisdiction also to determine questions of fact alone, then in order to get support for this proposal he would be willing to make that amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03378">Next his scheme dealt with purchase. He had an intense objection to any individual or corporation engaged in the taking of land being allowed to fix the price at which it was to be taken compulsorily, and he suggested that the price should be fixed by an independent person, by a party who had nothing to do with the Irish Government and nothing to do with the sale of land. The Board of Trade when land was required by railway companies or for waterworks appointed an arbitrator who assessed the price. He followed that analogy and the analogy of the Small Holdings Act in providing that compensation should be assessed by a single arbitrator. He further followed the policy of the Small Holdings Act by providing that compensation was to be paid, not only for the land taken, but also for the land which was injuriously affected, on the principles of the Lands Clauses Act. Those principles were that a person was to be compensated for the loss sustained by having his property taken from him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03379">These were the provisions which he submitted for their Lordships' acceptance. If noble Lords in any portion of the House were to traverse the congested districts and came face to face with the misery that prevailed, he was sure they would not begrudge the conferring of compulsory powers where necessary to procure the land that was to work out for those unfortunate people a means of deliverance from the want and the misery that darkened their lives. He knew the objection that was entertained to compulsion in all forms, and he knew that recourse was often had to the rather familiar argument that this was the "thin end of the wedge." The
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0556"/>
<col>1099</col>
thin end of the wedge had been introduced long ago under the Labourers Act and in the Housing of the Working Classes Act. If compulsion was necessary to relieve the misery of urban slums, was it not also necessary to relieve the misery of these agricultural slums? Neither this Bill nor his Amendment, if adopted, would introduce the thin end of the wedge for the first time, but might diminish the force behind the wedge. He had also heard it said that compulsion had been asked for in the North of Ireland and that it had been refused, but that was altogether of a different character. It was not necessary to take the land and sell it to the tenants when &#x00A3;56,000,000 of contracts were hung up and not financed. He did not think compulsory powers should be given for that purpose; but for the purpose of relieving congestion, which was the open sore of Ireland, he hoped their Lordships would see their way to grant compulsory powers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03380"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL of SWINFORD</member> desired to add a few words to the remarks he had already made. He had not gone into an explanation or a defence of the proposals in his own scheme, nor did he contrast them with the proposals of the noble and learned Lord. The first point he desired to place before their Lordships was that the Congested Districts Board would presumably be a Board composed of independent men of position and public repute in Ireland, men acquainted with the circumstances of the congested districts and whose opinions upon the matters with which they would have to deal would carry great weight in the West of Ireland. But the noble and learned Lord's proposal would make the Congested Districts Board subordinate in the most important part of their work to the Estates Commissioners. The most important part of their work would be deciding whether certain lands should not be bought for the relief of congestion. Having made up their minds that the purchase was necessary, they would, according to this scheme, call upon the Estates Commissioners to buy. But, according to the noble and learned Lord's scheme, the Estates Commissioners would sit in judgment upon the Board's decision whether it was necessary to buy or not. Who was more likely to be right in dealing with the question of the suitability of particular land for the relief of congestion and the necessity of acquiring
<col>1100</col>
that land&#x2014;the Congested Districts Board, consisting of twelve members of high position and character, or the Estates Commissioners? He forgot at the moment how many judges the noble and learned Lord proposed to employ. He though it was the Judicial Commissioner and the two Estates Commissioners. If that was so, he ventured to say there was no comparison between the opportunities of judgment of the two bodies in regard to the particular work. If in such a case as that the Estates Commissioners rejected the opinion of the Congested Districts Board, the Board would lose a great deal of its authority for good, and probably men of character would be unwilling to remain members of the Board when their most earnest efforts to relieve congestion were met in such a manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03381">The next point was the question of the uses to which the Congested Districts. Board were to put the land. The Board were to satisfy the Estates Commissioners that the land would be put to good uses. He thought the noble and learned Lord's proposals were drawn without full consideration of what the necessary procedure of the Board was. The Board did not always buy congested property and then proceed to buy untenanted land to relieve it. Its policy was to place itself in possession of a sufficient quantity of untenanted land, to prepare the untenanted land beforehand, dividing it into holdings, fencing and draining, and so on, so that when they had purchased an estate they might be ready to migrate people to the particular holdings already prepared for them. If the Board conducted that policy on any large scale it would be difficult for them to say how they were going to use the land and to what particular tenants they were going to give it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03382">In regard to the intricacies of appeal which the noble and learned Lord's scheme presented, he asked their Lordships to consider the procedure. First, there would be an application by the Board to the Estates Commissioners. The Estates Commissioners would then consider whether or not there was a <i>prima facie</i> case made out by the Board. If they considered that such a case was established, they would then issue notices calling upon people to object to the proposals if any objections were
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0557"/>
<col>1101</col>
entertained, and then they would proceed to consider those objections. After that stage was passed, if the Estates Commissioners approved of the scheme of the Board, there was an appeal open for any person who was dissatisfied to this quasijudicial body, and it would be open for that body to hold up the whole proceedings for five years, according to his reading of the noble and learned Lord's scheme. If the acquisition of land was held up in one case for five years there would be a premium held out to objectors in order that in their own cases the same procrastination might take place. If the first appellate Court agreed with the Estates Commissioners that the scheme was a good one, there was a second appeal both on the facts and on the law to the highest Court in Ireland, so that for an estate which might be worth &#x00A3;200 or &#x00A3;300 they might have this concatination of appeals, which would land the Board in great expense and the people themselves into great disappointment and despair.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03383">As to the fixing of the price, nobody was more willing than himself to have the price fixed by a proper tribunal, but he doubted whether in Ireland they would find people anxious or willing to place the arbitrament of these disputes in the hands of a single arbitrator, and he thought from all he knew of Irish life they would find great dissatisfaction if they placed in the hands of the Board of Works, which was a Treasury Department, the settling of prices. He thought that they would be more likely to find an impartial tribunal in the one he proposed. These were the main points that occurred to him at the moment, and he asked their Lordships to consider them in weighing the merits of both schemes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03384"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said that he was in some difficulty as he had to discuss at the same time the Amendment of his noble and learned friend (Lord Atkinson), that of the noble Lord opposite, and the clauses in the Bill. His noble and learned friend Lord Atkinson had laid great stress on the argument that compulsion ought never to be entertained unless the necessity for it was proved, and proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal which he described. He would go further than that. He wanted to see the necessity for compulsion proved before that House, for hitherto they had had nothing but generalities. They had just been told by Lord MacDonnell that in order to relieve congestion in
<col>1102</col>
the West of Ireland all the grass lands in Connaught must be taken. But what they wanted to know was what was being done with the grass lands which the Congested Districts Board had had in their hands for many years? Had they made any successful attempts at migration? He knew of a case in his own county where they had failed. They had purchased a property of some eight hundred acres, and divided it and built houses. Then they had induced some men living not very far off, not above fifteen or twenty miles away as the crow flew, living on the Galway mountains, to come down to see the place. But though it was not in a congested neighbourhood the people of the locality drove the men and the inspector away, and they only escaped under the protection of the police. But they might have succeeded elsewhere, and they would like to know whether this was the case. All they knew was that the Congested Districts Board had a large quantity of land on their hands, and he asked why had not some scheme of the kind been carried out?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03385"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: Because the Treasury did not give the money. The action of the Board was restricted because funds ran short, and that is one of the reasons why this legislation has been undertaken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03386"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member> said that might be a reason why it could not be carried out on a large scale, but be failed to see why it could not have been carried out on a small scale. They had the land, and surely an experiment might have been made. It was easier to transplant twenty or thirty families than it would be to transplant two or three hundred. If the thing was to be done on a large scale, could they point to any large number, fulfilling the necessary condition of a large scale, efinhabitants of a congested district who were prepared to move if the land was available and ready for them? Could they show that they could do it in the present state of the country, with the opposition that was offered to them from the landless men? He was happy to see that both the noble lord opposite and his noble and learned friend wished to confine the operation of this compulsion to cases of absolute congestion. But the clauses in the Bill before them appeared to contemplate the land being taken for all sorts of purposes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03387">The duties of the Board, as they understood them, were to relieve congestion in a
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0558"/>
<col>1103</col>
district by enlarging the holdings, by migration, and by giving a certain amount of land to the landless men. The noble Earl opposite treated the latter as a subsidiary point, but said that it was necessary to a certain extent in order to propitiate them and to satisfy the land hunger. It was hoped that by giving land to a certain number of these people they would propitiate the whole class and that they would no longer resist the introduction of the migrants. If the Government thought that they could make a man grateful by giving the land to somebody else, he thought they were very sanguine, and that they would be disappointed. A man who was left out in the cold would be very likely to say, "Am I not as good a man as the other, and why should I be refused land? It may be that I was not active enough in agitation;" and it would be more likely to induce that man and his friends to join in any future agitation. For, in the state of anarchy in which the country was at present, owing to the manner in which the Government had abdicated their functions in favour of the United Irish League, the people had come to believe that the only way to obtain anything was by agitation and violence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03388">Only the other day a relative of his was talking to his tenants, who asked him whether he had received all the purchase money due to him. He said he had received part of it, but that there were troublesome delays. Then some of them said, "May be it is a pity there was no cattle-driving. We would have been happy to do it if it would do your honour any good." Of course, he told them they must not engage in any such scandalous proceedings; but they said, "Is there anything else we can do to help your honour?" evidently thinking that some violence would be beneficial. He told them to be quiet, but that what they could do would be to complain of the delay, which affected them also because they were paying higher sums in interest on the purchase money than on the purchase instalment. He mentioned that to show their Lordships what the feeling in the country was and he wished to know why these large tracts of land which the Congested Districts Board now held had not been utilised in any way? Was it that they found that the people, whether holders of small farms on the spot, migrants, or landless men, not only wanted to get the land but to get it cheap, and that they refused to buy it on terms which would
<col>1104</col>
repay the Board for their previous outlay in purchasing it? If that was the case it went far to show what they had often maintained, that the people knew themselves that when the land was split up and made into small portions it would not produce so good a return or carry so much stock as in its undivided state, and that they therefore refused to purchase on the terms which one tenant who had the whole farm would accept.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03389">The noble Lord opposite said that the landlords were asking too much for their land, but that he wished to give them a fair price. Was the idea of a fair price not the value of the land to the vendor, but the price which the Board, looking to resale, were disposed to give, and that the vendor was to be forced to accept the latter? Again, they said they had to consider what they would do with the land afterwards, and the expense they would be put to in dividing, fencing, and so on. This expenditure would naturally be necessary, but it was very unjust that a vendor should have to pay for it. He never heard of a man whose land was taken compulsorily to make a railway being called upon to contribute to the construction of the line. Surely the fair thing was to give a man the value of what he now had, and not mulct him by charging him for something that had to be done to the land afterwards. As long as they heard nothing but generalities and could find no instance given where compulsion was necessary, they wished to oppose compulsion in any shape or form.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03390"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> said he did not want their Lordships to be under the impression that the Congested Districts Board would not know what to do with the land if they had compulsory powers to acquire it. It had been repeatedly stated, and it was a fact, that the Congested Districts Board were at this moment the happy possessors of over a million pounds worth of land. Therefore they were quoted as being unable to dispose of the land that they had got, and why, it was asked, did they want more? He thought he could clear up that position. There were two things that came together. First of all, there was the acquisition of the land, and the money that was required for the purchase of the land was supplied by the National Debt Commissioners to the Land Commission. Secondly, after purchase there was the improvement and the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0559"/>
<col>1105</col>
enlargement of the estates, for which money was wanted. That money was the only income which Parliament had given to the Board, and they had always maintained that the moneys provided by Parliament had not been sufficient to deal with the estates which they owned upon a large scale. Therefore they were in this position, that they had the land but had not the money necessary to dispose of it. They wanted money to deal with large estates, and if they were to have a large income to prepare such estates for sale, they would know what to do with them if they were given compulsory powers, and they would be able to carry out the relief of congestion on a large scale. On the question of compulsory purchase he did not wish to say very much, except that they could deal with the land when they had it, whether it was acquired compulsorily or otherwise, if Parliament would only give them more income. With regard to the suggestions of the noble Lord opposite and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, he confessed that there was a great deal in what Lord MacDonnell had said as to the difficulty the Board might experience in being entirely under the Estates Commissioners, who, when the Board had said they required certain lands, might not agree.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03391"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> said that any one who had listened to these debates must have come to the conclusion that what stood against the acquisition of land, either voluntarily or compulsorily, was the fact that money did not seem to be forthcoming from the Treasury. The speech of his noble friend Lord Shaftesbury, who was so able a member of the Board, spoke volumes on the subject. He therefore asked again why it was desired to obtain land compulsorily, for which payment could not be made, when there was at the same time a great amount of land voluntarily open. Surely it would be well to utilise that land by purchasing it than by endeavouring to take land compulsorily from other people who did not wish to sell. He knew how prosperous was the condition of the land farmed by the Congested Districts Board; indeed, he believed that the graziers of the country had such an admiration of the manner in which the Board farmed their land that they were jealous of them and of the price they could get for their cattle in the various markets. If His Majesty's Government came down to the House and said
<col>1106</col>
the whole country was infested with "cantankerous landlords"&#x2014; a phrase invented by the noble Earl himself&#x2014;and that not one of them could by hook or by crook be induced to sell his land, then he thought a case would have been made out for powers to compel those people to sell; but when the Government could not give the name of a single landlord of that kind and the Board had a vast amount of land ready to be bought on voluntary terms, their Lordships ought to consider very carefully whether they would admit the principle of compulsion into this measure, except under extreme conditions. There was other land besides that owned by the Board which he believed could be bought if the Government chose to set about it in the right way. He would not weary the Committee with figures, but as he came down to the House he had had placed into his hands a document showing the sales of the tenants' interest in the congested districts, and it showed that even in counties where there were no large tracts of untenanted land, large numbers of holdings could every year be obtained for the relief of congestion if the Government chose to buy, because they were frequently in the market. In the table he referred to there were 127 holdings belonging to tenants covering 10,278 acres, and land was going into the market under the same conditions every day. Why could not the Government apply themselves to buy some of this land from the tenant purchasers instead of trying to acquire it compulsorily from people who did not care to sell under what they conceived to be an adequate price? He knew it was frequently quoted that the Dudley Commission recommended compulsion, but they only recommended compulsion, as far as he read the Report, on certain conditions. They, said&#x2014;
<quote>"We desire to emphasise the fact that our recommendation in favour of the granting of compulsory powers is entirely conditional upon our recommendations in these particulars being carried out."</quote>
What were those particulars, and had they been carried out? He could not for himself think, although he would be glad to be contradicted, that any one of those recommendations had been carried out in the Bill now before their Lordships' House The Report said that the Congested Districts Board were responsible for the preliminary procedure. He did not quite understand whether that was the case under the Bill or whether
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0560"/>
<col>1107</col>
those duties had not been given more or less to the Estates Commissioners, and the fixing of the price was also given to the Estates Commissioners. He could not but think that in an attempt to take land compulsorily, when as he had shown there was so much land to be had voluntarily, it was the duty of His Majesty's Government to explain their reasons for asking for such very stringent measures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03392"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> was sure that their Lordships, and particularly noble Lords from Ireland, had listened with the greatest interest to the speeches and schemes which had been put forward. It seemed to him that the noble and learned Lord and the noble Lord opposite resembled the two kings of Brentford sitting on one throne, and both of them wielding with rather feeble hands the sceptre of compulsion. For himself he would rather have the out-and-out compulsion in the Bill, where the compulsion embraced the whole of Ireland and reigned over the whole country. It was a sort of disputation, he took it, between the two noble Lords on opposite sides of the House. Those noble Lords who lived in Ireland, who had their interests in Ireland and derived a great deal of their income, such as it was, from Ireland, whatever their stake in the country was, were totally opposed to compulsion in any form, notwithstanding all the generalities which had been indulged in, and all the appeals of the noble and learned Lord as to the long ranks of miserable congests in the West.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03393">Take the scheme of Lord MacDonnell. The noble Lord began by saying that there was a corner in the land; the noble Lord had tried to make their Lordships believe that people in the West were holding out and that a corner in land was being created. Personally he did not believe there was any corner in land in the West. Lord Shaftesbury, a member of the Congested Districts Board, had said that they had &#x00A3;1,000,000 worth of land to deal with. They could make a corner in wheat, but when a person held a million options in wheat, would it be called a corner? Not for an instant. Then Lord MacDonnell said the landlords were holding out for their own price. He would call their Lordships' attention to the O'Conor Don's evidence before the Dudley Commission. The O'Conor Don said that land was available in great quantities if a fair
<col>1108</col>
price was offered for it. He was not going to argue what a fair price was, because that had been argued over and over again in both Houses. Then Lord MacDonnell went on to say that there was a complete stoppage of sales to the Congested Districts Board. A member of that Board had told their Lordships that the reason why there had been a complete stoppage of sales was that the Board had no money with which to purchase. The Bill was a Treasury Bill with compulsion hung on to it for no reason whatever, and with no evidence to show that compulsion was necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03394">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, had said that he spoke for himself. That he could quite believe; and with the noble and learned Lord's knowledge of the numerous Land Acts, of their passing and of their working, he was competent to speak of them in every way, and he had said that compulsion should never be resorted to unless it was necessary. But in submitting this scheme the noble and learned Lord had never once put before their Lordships a single case or stated a single case to show that compulsion was necessary. Then the noble and learned Lord appealed to their Lordships in the way in which a great many of his countrymen appealed&#x2014;namely, to sentiment. He spoke of the miserable congests standing in ranks before their Lordships. If the noble and learned Lord had been talking of some years ago he could imagine his speaking in that sort of way, but times had a little changed since then, and he thought the noble and learned Lord knew that as well as he did. They were not talking of the past, they were talking of the present, and it was admitted by those who had studied the congested districts question that there, had, been a great improvement in the conditions of the population as a whole. To summarise the evidence given before the Dudley Commission, it was that within the last fifteen or twenty years the parish priests admitted that there was no longer any question of starvation even during periods of distress. What became, therefore, of the miserable ranks of congests standing before their Lordships' House? Thank Providence they were in a better state owing to the efforts of the Congested Districts Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the Agricultural Co-operative Society. He did not think that the noble and learned Lord could still parade his miserable ranks before them.</p>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0561"/>
<col>1109</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03395">Then Lord Atkinson talked of the misery of the agricultural slums. Personally, he had been through some of the worst parts, and he admitted that there were places in the West of Ireland where people ought not to be at all and which were only fit for the stag and the grouse to live upon. But the love of home was so great among those people that they would live there if their holdings were increased. There was one district in particular, a more deserted waste one did not wish to see, where the Congested Districts Board had enlarged the holdings of the peasantry; they had money then and built cottages for them, and when he was there he was told by the parish priest that the people were quite happy, living in a place that their Lordships would be astonished to think anybody would live in. Yet those people liked their homes, their surroundings had been made better, their potato plots had been made bigger and they were happy where they were. With regard to Lord MacDonnell's scheme, that embraced the West Riding of the county of Cork and also a part of Donegal, and it would seem that Lord MacDonnell intended to maintain the old area subject to occasional variation by the Lord Lieutenant. He also stated that he did not desire to extend the area of congestion and that his scheme would permit the purchase of untenanted land anywhere in an administrative county.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03396"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: In an administrative county containing a congested districts county.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03397"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said that was a saving clause which was most important, and they would hear the views of noble Lords from Ireland who would speak on that subject from local knowledge. The noble and learned Lord alluded to compulsion in Acts in England. That was quite true; but when land was taken by compulsion under those Acts for these purposes it was taken under perfectly fair conditions. The noble and learned Lord said that the conditions he proposed were perfectly fair and that the Court. of Appeal would be one in which they could have absolute trust, and he started with the assumption that compulsion was necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03398"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> pointed out that he did exactly the reverse; the person who applied for compulsion had to prove that it was necessary.</p>
<col>1110</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03399"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> wished the noble and learned Lord had himself taken the trouble to prove that compulsion was necessary, but he had not done so in any way. They were still looking for those terrible cases where it was said that compulsion was necessary. Was there any great outcry for compulsory purchase in Ireland? The noble and learned Lord was supporting the Bill with his ranks of miserable congests. They were not miserable. They had been told that the Irish peasantry had emigrated and sought labour elsewhere. But for years and years they had done that; it was nothing new; ever since civilised agriculture came into the United Kingdom they had done it. Even during the Napoleonic wars, when it was well worth anybody's while to grow corn, they emigrated, and they were told that that going away from Ireland to earn money elsewhere was a terrible thing. It was not a terrible thing; it was honest labour, whether it be in Ireland or Scotland. The people even went across the Atlantic now because the passage was so cheap, and came back again to the South of Ireland with the money they had earned. A case had yet to be made out for compulsion. He really did not think it was the duty of the Opposition to forward, even in the most measured terms, compulsion in any form.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03400"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think, perhaps, it would be for the convenience of the House, without in any way desiring to curtail the debate on these Amendments, which are clearly of the first importance, if I were now to state the views of His Majesty's Government with regard to the Amendments and with some allusions to the speeches which have so far been made. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Atkinson, who is responsible for one of these Amendments, set forth with much eloquence the case for compulsion in certain cases; but it is evident from what has fallen from the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, and from some other speakers that the noble and learned Lord in holding, as he does, the conviction that it is not wise or just to run the risk of preventing the amelioration of the condition of these poor people in the West of Ireland by altogether refusing compulsion, is at variance with most of the speakers on his own side of the House. Noble Lords opposite must, of course, settle their differences amongst themselves, but it is my duty as representing the Government here to set forward
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0562"/>
<col>1111</col>
what we consider to be the case which makes the provision of compulsory powers an absolute necessity in certain parts of Ireland. I greatly regretted the decision of the House in not permitting the principle of compulsion to apply to other parts of Ireland. I do not think it would have been dangerously used, and I think that a system of compulsion applicable to the whole of Ireland would at least have avoided one criticism which is sure to be made, and in fact is now being made in the course of this debate&#x2014;namely, that you are putting upon certain landlords in Ireland, who are neither better nor worse than their neighbours, what they consider a disability from which other landlords in Ireland are free.<lb/>
The noble Marquess asked what need there was for compulsion in any part of Ireland even within the congested districts so long as land was obtainable, and in particular so long as a considerable quantity of land was under the control of the Congested Districts Board as at present. I think that point was fully answered by the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, who is a member of the Congested Districts Board. He showed that what had prevented the dealing with this land which they had was not want of funds to buy land, because there was plenty of money for that, but want of funds to lay out and improve it, and so long as the Congested Districts Board remained with its limited income the improvement could not possibly keep pace with the purchase, but now that we come forward with this very much larger annual sum for the Congested Districts Board as is proposed in the Bill, that difficulty will disappear. But, my Lords, there is quite another point which supplies an answer to the noble Marquess. We have been discussing all through this debate the difficulty and even danger which might surround the extensive migration of people from one district to another. Surely, if that be so, it points to the fact that it may be necessary, in order to relieve particular cases of congestion, to buy land actually in the immediate neighbourhood of the congests, and it may not be a complete answer to the Congested Districts Board when they wish to buy so many acres in a particular place to say, "You can have 1,000 acres forty or fifty miles off." This is a point that seems to have been lost sight of, and in view of all that has been said about the difficulties arising
<col>1112</col>
from the landless men and the general agreement that I thought existed that the first people to be provided with land were the congests in the neighbourhood of the land&#x2014;that seemed to me to be a matter that was generally approved in all parts of the House&#x2014;the point becomes exceedingly relevant. The other day in another place my right hon. friend gave some figures which I do not wish to repeat because the answer is at the disposal of anybody who cares to look it up in <i>Hansard</i>, but it was to the effect that in the four counties of Roscommon, Galway, Sligo, and Mayo the Board made certain inquiries from landowners in respect of untenanted land valued at &#x00A3;112,000, and the land which owners expressed their willingness to sell, in reply to those applications, was valued at &#x00A3;10,000 only; that is to say, less than one-tenth of the amount applied for. The noble Marquess asked for names. Does he really desire that a list of those gentlemen who refused and the names of their estates should be read out in this House with a view, I suppose, of holding them up to something like public reprobation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03401"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> said he was dealing with the noble Earl's own point that there were cantankerous landlords in Ireland. Personally he was of opinion that very few, if any, existed. The mere fact of a circular being sent round did not prove very much. He received hundreds of circulars from landagents and others of which he took no notice, and therefore he thought that landowners ought not to be condemned on such a ground.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03402"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: We are not on the cantankerous landlord point at all now, if I may say so, and I do not know why the phrase should be used.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03403"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member> said the noble Earl had himself invented it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03404"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I did use the expression, and I feel greatly honoured by the universal adoption it has received. The cantankerous landlord, however, was not mentioned in relation to the congested districts, but purely in regard to outside sales, and we are now talking of those gentlemen, who, for reasons best known to themselves&#x2014;and I am far from saying that all their land would have to be
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0563"/>
<col>1113</col>
compulsorily bought, or anything like it&#x2014;have not replied to the request of the Congested Districts Board. I myself should not have compared the Congested Districts Board and the gentlemen who comprise it to a casual firm of house-agents who circularise the noble Marquess to sell his house in Park-lane. I should have put the Congested Districts Board in a position somewhat higher than that, and I should certainly have supposed, in a case where a body of the character and standing of the Congested Districts Board wrote to a landowner saying they required certain land for the purposes of relieving congestion and asking to be informed whether he was prepared to sell his untenanted land, that some notice would naturally have been taken by the recipient of the request.<lb/>
There seems to be some idea that compulsion will be very freely exercised, and that it will have the effect of lowering prices. The noble and learned Lord pointed out with great truth that compulsory purchase of land has existed in many forms already under previous Acts, but I think he did not mention the fact that it has existed, so far as all superior interests in land are concerned under all the Land Purchase Acts&#x2014;that is to say, that everybody who held a superior interest in an estate was liable to have that particular security taken away from him whether he liked it or not. Compulsory sale, which, as the noble Marquess, I think, pointed out on a former occasion, is really a more accurate term than compulsory purchase, has already been applied to all such owners of superior interests. What I am impressed with in considering the whole subject, and this fact accounts for the shape which we have given to our compulsory purchase powers, is not the ease or generality with which compulsory powers can be exercised in all circumstances, but the extreme difficulty of exercising them at all. The Evicted Tenants Act has already been mentioned in this respect. I believe as a matter of fact that the Estates Commissioners have found it difficult and unprofitable to exercise their compulsory powers to any extent under these Acts, for the simple reason that they have always found that they have had to pay very much more than they would have had to do had they secured the land by agreement. But there are, of course, limits, and the position of the landlords in the congested districts is a peculiar one and it must be
<col>1114</col>
remembered that every year as more land is bought it will become more peculiar still If they have not already reached it, they will soon be reaching the point where they will possess a very valuable monopoly of land against a public Department whose operations are directed and urged on, not, by business considerations, but by considerations of general sympathy and pity for those poor people living under the most wretched circumstances, sympathy which was so finely expressed, if I may say so, by the noble and learned Lord. The effect of that monopoly must be, as soon as the amount of available land in those districts begins to diminish, and it has already began to diminish, to send up the price enormously. You must then either stop the operations of the Congested Districts Board and leave these poor people, or many of them, unprovided for and leave congestion unrelieved, or you must pay any price the owners choose to ask unless you can have recourse to this what I will call weapon of compulsion as a last resource.<lb/>
I recoil from either alternative. It may not happen this year or next year; but it is beginning to happen now, I think, and with. every &#x00A3;10,000 worth of land the Congested Districts Board buy, the greater will become that monopoly value which the remainder will undoubtedly tend to possess. I am bound to say, and I think it better to, state it at once, that we do regard the possession of a compulsory power, I will not put it higher than that at this moment, as an absolutely indispensable condition to the passage of this Bill into law. It is better to state that quite frankly, because noble Lords must consider what they may regard as the varying advantages between going without this measure altogether or admitting in some form in the background this principle of compulsion. I cannot help feeling that there are noble Lords connected with Ireland who do not share the views so strongly expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Mayo, and others, that compulsion in all forms is impossible, because I have noticed throughout this debate the rather unusual absence of certain noble Lords, and particularly noble Lords connected with the part of Ireland to which this provision would apply. Of course I am not entitled to draw any conclusions from that, but the fact remains that it is somewhat singular that those people who might be specially affected have not appeared to support the views of noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0564"/>
<col>1115</col>
The noble Earl, Lord Mayo, if he will forgive me for saying so, appeared to me to be less convincing than usual in the arguments which he put forward upon this subject of compulsion. He used one argument which I confess surprised me coming from him. He said there was no great outcry in Ireland for compulsion. If any of us on this side of the House had said such a thing we should have been told, what I venture to tell the noble Earl, that it is not a very safe thing to do to challenge great outcries in Ireland, and if the need exists I think it is better to meet it without waiting for those great outcries which sometimes, as we know with regret, go rather further than outcries and lead to conduct of a kind which we all deplore and reprobate. Then the noble Earl mentioned a district in Ireland which I myself have visited. No doubt it is a scene of great desolation, but the noble Earl said there were a number of small peasants there whose holdings had been enlarged by the Congested Districts Board and who now appeared to be perfectly contented and happy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03405"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said that the Board had money to do it with then.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03406"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: They have a great deal more money now; and in what sense the noble Earl intended that to be an argument against the operations of the Board I confess I fail to see.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03407"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> pointed out that that land was not acquired compulsorily.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03408"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Then I do not understand why the noble Earl introduced the subject at all. Having so far dealt with what we consider to be the necessity for the introduction of this principle of compulsion, I ought to say a word about the different forms in which it is proposed to be applied by the Bill and in the two Amendments. Speaking generally, the objection that we take to the form of compulsion proposed by the noble and learned Lord opposite is to the extreme elaboration which surrounds all the proceedings, and which, in our opinion, would make it very difficult to apply. The noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, pointed out that as a member of the Board he did not see why the Congested Districts Board should be placed in so subordinate a position to the Land Commission as the noble Lord proposes to
<col>1116</col>
place them. Quite apart from that, it does seem to me that if the Congested Districts Board have to submit to the Land Commission a scheme setting forth the lands to be acquired compulsorily, the extent, nature, boundaries, and condition thereof, and the names of the person or persons by whom the same is owned, occupied, used, or enjoyed and the mode in which it is used or cultivated, together with the names of the person or persons to whom as tenants or proprietors of holdings of less rateable value than &#x00A3;10 they propose that a parcel of the said lands should be sold&#x2014;if all those operations and a great many others have to be gone through, we fear that the preliminaries of the transactions will prove to be very long and very troublesome.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03409"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> pointed out that the words were "as far as reasonably practicable."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03410"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I ought to have mentioned that, but still it shows the extreme elaboration with which the noble and learned Lord proposes that the Congested Districts Board should proceed. Then the Judicial Commissioner and two of the Estates Commissioners have to decide whether a <i>prima facie</i> case has been established for compulsory acquisition, thereby sitting in judgment on the Congested Districts Board, and they are then to proceed to publish notices, and so on. Then the tribunal set up by the noble and learned Lord to hear objections is certainly an ingenious one. It consists of the Judicial Commissioner, one Estates Commissioner, and one Judge of the King's Bench Division takes in rotation. I may say at once that I think that tribunal is infinitely preferable to the tribunal suggested by my noble friend behind me, which does not seem to me, if he will forgive my saying so, a possible tribunal for the adjudication of the particular subjects which would come before them. On the other hand, we think in the first place that the preliminaries suggested by the noble and learned Lord are so long and involved, and may cover such a vast amount of time, as has been already pointed out by Lord MacDonnell, that we are afraid that the knowledge of the difficulties will not only make it difficult to exercise compulsion but will tend to so discourage the Congested Districts Board from entering into transactions at all that the section will prove likely to have very little effect indeed.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0565"/>
<col>1117</col>
From that I pass to the proposition of my noble friend behind me. So far as the preliminary stages are concerned, the processes designed by him are undoubtedly more rapid than those of the noble and learned Lord opposite, but there are certain points in connection with this Amendment to which I am bound to allude. I do not quite see why the noble Lord limits his powers of purchase to congested estates, because it might easily happen that there would be cases where congestion on a congested estate would be more conveniently relieved by the purchase of a non-congested estate and not only the untenanted land which happened to be comprised in it. There might be cases, in fact, where the owner would prefer to sell the whole rather than merely part with the untenanted land. Then the clause numbered (B) by my noble friend seems to impose a somewhat needless provision. It says that where the owner agrees to enter into negotiations the Land Commission may depute inspectors to ascertain particulars and to estimate the price of the estate proposed to be purchased. It seems hardly worth while to insert a provision of that kind in an Act of Parliament, because if the owner agrees to sell he is not likely to object to having his land inspected for the purpose of seeing what it is like. Then the noble Lord makes a proposition which is a somewhat serious one. He proposes that in all cases of purchases, whether voluntary or not, the payments must be made in cash. That is a new proposition, and one which opens a rather serious prospect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03411"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> said he had taken that from the Government clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03412"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is only in respect of compulsory purchase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03413"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> pointed out that the whole scheme dealt only with compulsory purchase.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03414"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord's own words are "by agreement and otherwise than by agreement," and then the clause provides, where the purchase is carried out, that payment shall "be made by means of money and not by means of stock, except in cases where the vendor agrees to accept in lieu of cash any amount of guaranteed three per cent. stock." That is a point which, of course, must mean, if the purchases are large, a further issue of
<col>1118</col>
excess stock to an amount greater than contemplated in the Bill. There are various minor points in my noble friend's Amendment which would demand very careful consideration. He does not deal with the point, for instance, which although it is a small one still is an important one, where an owner instead of refusing to sell made no reply and adopted a purely passive attitude.<lb/>
In such a case no steps could be taken with regard to compulsory purchase at all. If the noble Lord's Amendment were accepted, we should have to insert a considerable number of consequential provisions on other matters, because t is not clear whether the actual purchasers, as suggested by my noble friend, are to be the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board.<lb/>
I pass next to my noble friend's proposed Court of Appeal. I think all noble Lords in this House, not only noble and learned Lords but a great many others, would be disposed to agree that a tribunal of three Judges is not a good tribunal to settle questions which will almost always be simply questions of value. There is no precedent, so far as I know, for putting Judges of the High Court in such a position. We think that our proposed tribunal of the Judicial Commissioner, who is always spoken of in this House with the utmost respect, and deservedly so, with two lay assessors&#x2014;that is to say, with two fellow arbitrators, because that is what it really comes to&#x2014;would form a very safe and excellent tribunal for fixing these questions of price. The noble and learned Lord said that he did not like assessors, but surely if they were called arbitrators he would not object to them so much. They would be gentlemen competent to form an opinion on these disputed points of value, and so far as questions of law are concerned we think that they would be safe in the hands of the Judicial Commissioner. We do not like the tribunal proposed by my noble friend, and I have no doubt that if your Lordships generally should prefer the proposals in his clauses to those of the noble and learned Lord, my noble friend would be willing to reconsider the question of the ultimate tribunal. There are one or two other points in my noble friend's Amendment that we do not quite like. There is his Clause (D), for instance, which prohibits the purchase of any land mentioned in the paragraph.
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0566"/>
<col>1119</col>
That, I think, might work out inconveniently to some landlords who might desire to sell their whole estate. I think that is all at this stage that I need say about these different Amendments. The ultimate effect is, of course, that we greatly prefer our own proposals as they stand, although we regret the fact that they cannot be made to apply outside the congested districts. But so far as celerity of procedure is concerned we prefer next the proposals of my noble friend behind me to those of the noble and learned Lord opposite, although we think that the tribunal suggested by the noble and learned Lord is a much more suitable one than that which my noble friend proposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03415"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: During our somewhat protracted debates on this Bill we have not, I think, discussed any subject approaching in importance to that which is now before the House. A great principle is at issue. Your Lordships are asked to decide whether you desire to exclude from the Bill every scrap and vestige of compulsion. With the question of general compulsion the House has already dealt. We have determined that we would not accept general compulsion as proposed in the Bill as it originally came before us. That question is disposed of.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, with regard to the more restricted compulsion of the kind indicated in the two Amendments which are before us, may I be permitted to say that in my humble opinion it is rather late in the day for your Lordships' House to take upon itself to say that upon grounds of principle you refuse altogether to admit compulsion in any shape or form within the four corners of this Bill. In the measures which come before us from time to time dealing with all parts of the United Kingdom it seems to me that we are constantly discussing this question of compulsion, and always on the assumption that compulsion in itself is not a wrong thing if you can carefully limit the objects for which it is to be exercised and the manner in which it is to be applied. There are many analogies which will at once occur to your Lordships. I need hardly refer to the Small Holdings Act which your Lordships passed and to the Housing and Town-Planning Bill which is still before your Lordships' House; even in Ireland there have been, as the noble Earl pointed out, cases in which we have admitted the principle of compulsion; now with regard to compulsion for the purpose of relieving con-
<col>1120</col>
gestion I am bound to point out that in giving this Bill a Second Reading we have admitted that this question of the relief of congestion really lies at the bottom of the whole of the proposed legislation. My noble friend Lord Mayo poured a certain amount of ridicule upon what was said by my noble and learned friend, Lord Atkinson, when he asked your Lordships to bear in mind the misery of the people who inhabited these congested areas and the absolute need of doing something to relieve that misery. But it is upon the admission that that condition of things exists in certain parts of Ireland that the Bill which we have accepted in principle is founded, and I for one shall not be deterred from giving your Lordships the advice which seems to me appropriate to the occasion by any prospect of being told that I am guided by what I think my noble friend called sentimental considerations.<lb/>
The question, then, is whether there is is or is not a case for that restricted form of compulsion which my two noble friends desire to introduce. A great deal has been said with regard to the attitude of the landlords in certain parts of Ireland. I think we may say that the cantankerous landlord, who was introduced to us the other evening by the noble Earl opposite, has been solemnly interred to-night. The case is no longer based upon the assertion that there are deliberately obstructive landlords who require to be coerced by special legislation. What was admitted, and what was clearly stated by my noble friend Lord MacDonnell was that these landlords are not disinclined to sell. What they are disinclined to do is to part with their land upon terms which do not represent its true and proper value, and I shall be surprised if, should it be possible to satisfy those landlords that they will really receive a full and adequate price for their property, the reluctance and the very natural reluctance which they have hitherto exhibited to selling does not to a great extent disappear.<lb/>
What are really the essential conditions if such a fair and reasonable price is to be secured to vendors of land in these districts of Ireland? Surely they are two. In the first place, that there shall be some perfectly impartial tribunal which shall be called upon to decide whether there really is a necessity for compulsion at all; and, in the next place, that there shall be some means of deciding, the first point being disposed of, whether
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0567"/>
<col>1121</col>
the compensation offered is or is not a sufficient compensation. Now both the proposals before your Lordships' House seem to me designed, and in many respects admirably designed, to secure that these conditions shall be fulfilled&#x2014;I mean that there shall be no question of compulsion unless a clear case to establish its necessity can be shown, and unless these is proper machinery provided for determining the terms on which compulsion is to be exercised. We are placed in a considerable difficulty in deciding which of these two Amendments is the more deserving of our support. My noble and learned friend Lord Atkinson has surrounded his proposal with what I might term a perfect zareba of precautions, for he adds Court to Court and appeal to appeal. It is conceivable, however, that on closer examination some of those precautions may prove to be not absolutely indispensable.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite passed the two Amendments in review and picked out for approval certain features in each and for criticism certain other proposals in each. I shall be surprised, under those circumstances, supposing your Lordships are prepared, as I hope you will be, to entertain the idea that carefully-guarded compulsion should be admitted, if any noble Lord on this side of the House will be ready to say without hesitation that either of the Amendments is of a kind that you are prepared to accept finally as a solution of these difficulties. The proposition before the House is, I take it, that Clause 64 of the Bill be omitted, and up to that point it seems to me that our way is clear. I should be inclined to suggest, if I may do so, that having removed the clause from the Bill it might be desirable to substitute for it the Amendment suggested by my noble and learned friend Lord Atkinson; but I hope he will forgive me for saying that if we adopt that course it will be upon the understanding that we shall be free to discuss with him in detail whether there are not points on which it might be advantageous to modify it.<lb/>
That is the conclusion to which I am disposed to come. I should have come to that conclusion, I think, in any circumstances, but I confess I am strengthened in it by the explicit statement made by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill. He has told us that in the view of His Majesty's
<col>1122</col>
Government the retention in the Bill of compulsion in some shape or form is absolutely indispensable. I must say it seems to me that even those of your Lordships who regard the suggestion of compulsion with the greatest amount of misgiving should think twice, in view of that statement of the noble Earl, before you take upon yourselves the responsibility of decreeing what I gather from him would be the final extinction of this Bill. The Bill contains many questionable proposals, but I am bound to say that, considering the position of affairs with regard to land purchase in Ireland, it would be a very serious thing indeed if your Lordships were to take any action which might have the effect of bringing purchase for the time to an end. For those reasons, my Lords, although I have never concealed the doubts which I entertain with regard to many of the proposals contained in this Bill, and although I can well understand the jealousy with which many of my noble friends regard the proposal to introduce compulsory principles within it, I feel bound, now that compulsion has been proposed by my two noble friends on each side of the House, to say that I shall certainly not go into the Lobby against the admission of that modified compulsion which is a common feature in the proposals of both noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03416"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he would be only too happy to endeavour to assist in simplifying the scheme he had suggested if it was thought to be too complicated. He would meet the objection of the noble Earl by saying that it should be, "such particulars as might be prescribed," striking out those he had inserted. With regard to the number of Courts, he thought, on reflection, that that would not prove to be such an expensive procedure as it might look, because if there was no objection the thing could be passed through at once. But even on that point he was anxious to make the machinery as simple, cheap, and expeditious as possible. He wished to add that he made no reflection on the Congested Districts Board in proposing his tribunal, but he did object to giving the Congested Districts Board or any other authority outside the Government of he day absolute power on their own motion to expropriate any man.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03417"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> did not wish to trouble their Lordships with regard to the question of general
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0568"/>
<col>1123</col>
compulsion, because there seemed to him to be no <i>prima facie</i> case whatever put forward by His Majesty's Government in favour of it, and it appeared to him to be little more than flogging a dead horse. But with regard to limited compulsion for the express purpose of relieving congestion, which was now under consideration, the position, of course, was very different. He would not attempt to argue the merits of the two schemes before the Committee after the leaders on both sides had put so clearly the many considerations on the one side and on the other; but on the main question whether compulsion was necessary or not he would like to say a word. Having committed himself more than twenty years ago to the principle of compulsory expropriation for the great purpose of the relief of congestion, he could not go back from that principle now, and he could not refrain from expressing his convictions on the point. He did not presume to rely solely upon his own judgment; they had heard the views of Lord MacDonnell and of Lord Shaftesbury, a member of the Congested Districts Board; and further than that he had received a letter from Sir Horace Plunkett, also a member of the Board, which he had asked him to read to the House. Sir Horace Plunkett wrote:&#x2014;
<quote>"I quite agree with you that grass lands must be taken for the relief of congestion, and that carefully-guarded powers to deal with some cases by compulsion at a fair price will be necessary. I know some words of mine, read without the context, have been cited in an opposite sense. My point was that until this limited compulsion is conceded the demand for unlimited compulsion, which I hold to be mischievous, will increase and do harm."</quote>
He (Lord Monteagle) quite agreed with Lord Mayo that the congests were not as miserable now as they were some years ago, but if they were not miserable they ought to be, and if he came from that quarter of Ireland he would do his best to make them miserable with a view of impressing upon Parliament the necessity of dealing with this great question. With regard to the question of whether migration was a panacea, or even an efficient remedy, he confessed he was not very sanguine, but he did appeal very earnestly to his noble friends not to let the landlords of Ireland appear to be standing in the way of the migration scheme. It had been urged, with great cogency he admitted, that there was the great difficulty of the landless men <i>versus</i> the
<col>1124</col>
congests and as to whether a migration scheme would ever be allowed to act on any large scale, but if the United Irish League were intimidating congests what better opportunity could they afford the League of getting their position made effective than by themselves taking the burden on their shoulders and opposing the compulsion which was sad to be necessary for the purpose of relieving congestion? He entirely declined to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for the United Irish League, and if the League proposed to block migration he thought they had better do it on their own account and not try to put up the landlords to do it for them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03418"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> said he was under the impression that the position taken up by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition was that while he was prepared to admit a moderate and guarded amount of compulsion he considered that a duty was laid upon His Majesty's Government to prove that such a measure was necessary. That, he ventured to say, had not only not been done but had hardly been attempted, and now they found that the noble Marquess deemed it wise to surrender the position with regard to compulsory purchase. Those of them who lived in the West of Ireland and who felt that they represented not only themselves but the opinion of the whole of the landlords in the West could only consider it their duty, whatever advice was offered to them by their leaders, to resist absolutely and without any hesitation the principle of compulsion. If he could find some common agreement on which to start his argument it would shorten what he had to say. He thought that all Members of their Lordships' House were probably agreed that the compulsory acquisition of land ought to be resorted to if it was proved, first of all, that it was for the good of the community at large; secondly, if the owner received due compensation; and, thirdly, only where it was impossible to acquire the land required for the purpose at an equitable price.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03419">He was quite ready to say that in certain cases it was right and proper that small holdings in the West of Ireland should be enlarged by the acquisition of grass lands. Where a tenant had improved his holding and was a capable tenant and possessed a knowledge of agriculture and had succeeded in acquiring a certain
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0569"/>
<col>1125</col>
amount of capital, he thought they would all agree that such a man ought to have an opportunity of increasing his holding, and in the ordinary course of events, if freedom of contract had been allowed in Ireland, that was exactly what would have happened, because landlords liked improving and prosperous tenants, and extra land would have been given to them had it not been for the fact that by so doing those lands would be brought under the operation of the Land Act of 1891. But their Lordships must not imagine that because that was so all those tenants were congested tenants. Landowners did the best they could for them, and it was an almost universal arrangement that for tenants with two, three, and four head of cattle their cattle should be taken in for grazing. On almost every estate there were farms reserved entirely for the convenience of tenants on the estate for the use of their cattle. In the case of all those people he would certainly say increase their holdings, but there were other tenants who were only in the position of labourers without diligence or a knowledge of farming or capital, and he believed it would be a cruel kindness to such people to enlarge their holdings. He did not think that any addition should be made to holdings which would do away altogether with the grazing industry in Connaught. He would like to ask what was the intent on of His Majesty's Government with regard to that, Did they intend only to give holdings to capable tenants who would improve them, and perhaps to landless men who in their view were also capable, or did they intend to give to one and all alike until they had divided the whole of the grass lands of Connaught and so have done away with that grazing industry which he believed would be the main factor in increasing the prosperity of the new holders?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03420">His next point was that those who ware dispossessed should be adequately compensated. He had dealt with that subject at length in his speech on the Second Reading and would not repeat what he then said, but there were cases where land had been compulsorily taken where the price given was an absolutely inadequate one, in particular where a landlord who had been receiving for many years &#x00A3;45 a year was awarded &#x00A3;580. Again, he would ask the noble Earl at what rate it was proposed to value the land taken. Was
<col>1126</col>
it to be taken at its present value or at the value it would possess for the purpose to which the noble Earl wished to apply it; in other words, did the Government adopt the attitude of the Estates Commissioners that for their purpose the land was worth fifty per cent. less to them than to the landlord, and did they, taking the fifteen per cent. deduction, propose to offer the landlord only thirty-five per cent. of the present value of the land? With regard to the power of the Estates Commissioners to send inspectors to examine the land, there had been cases where an inspector had gone down and stayed at an inn for the night and discussed the question of the value to be put on the land, with the result that boycotting had begun and landlords had found it impossible to re-let their lands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03421">There was another thing to be seriously regarded, and that was that when once the system of compulsion was adopted they absolutely stopped the system of voluntary purchase which had been so successful in the past and which they hoped would lead to the, regeneration of Ireland. Directly the compulsory principle was adopted not one single tenant would agree to purchase voluntarily, because they believed they would obtain better terms if compulsion were used for the purpose of obtaining the land. It was a matter of supreme importance to them in the West of Ireland that compulsion should not be allowed in any shape or form, and he appealed to all noble Lords, and particularly to those in Scotland who might have the principle extended to them at any minute, to support them in the Lobby when they voted, not only against the clause but against the Amendments of the noble Lords.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03422"><member>LORD FARNHAM</member> said he also was strongly opposed to compulsion in any shape or form, and that in his opinion and in that of many of his noble friends the voluntary system was the one to be supported. The moment compulsion was introduced into any part of Ireland voluntary sales would become impossible. Tenants had been led to believe by the United Irish League that they were going to get compulsion, and that under compulsion land would be obtained at far below its present price. If, therefore, their Lordships gave compulsion to any one part of Ireland, however guarded it might be, they would at once raise a
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0570"/>
<col>1127</col>
grievance amongst tenants in the other parts, and it would be seized upon as a further excuse for agitation, and that agitation would not be confined to one part of Ireland. As a landlord coming from Ulster, he could say that Ulster tenants had always proved good and loyal tenants and had always paid their rent regularly, and their point of view would be: "Here are those who have always been disloyal, the cattle-drivers, those who have always agitated against paying rent, going to be rewarded by compulsion being given in their case, whereas all we who have been so loyal are going to get by the Bill is that our annuity is going to be raised from three and a-quarter to three and a-half per cent."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03423">The Ulster tenants had been faithful and loyal, but if this great extra strain was</p>

<ol>
<li>(1) The Estates Commissioners shall publish in the "Dublin Gazette" a notice containing the prescribed particulars with respect to the lands proposed to be acquired, and calling upon any person interested in the same who may object on any ground to the acquisition thereof compulsorily under this section to lodge in the office of the Land Commissioner, within the prescribed time, a statement on the grounds of his or her objections:</li>
<li>(2) A copy of the aforesaid notice shall be served by the Estates Commissioners so soon as may be, in the prescribed manner, upon any person who appears to them to be the owner or an owner of the said land or any part thereof, and upon all persons known or believed by them to be interested therein:</li>
<li>(3) At any time after the publication of the aforesaid notice, any inspectors of the Estates Commissioners or other persons appointed by them in that behalf may enter upon the land and do all such things as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the three Commissioners aforesaid

to determine whether the said land is suitable for the purpose for which it is sought to be acquired:</li>
<li>(4) If no objection has been made by any of the persons aforesaid to the acquisition thereof under this Act, or any such objection, if made, has been withdrawn, the Estates Commissioners may make an order that on payment into the Bank of Ireland of the compensation for the lands taken and also for any other land of the same owner or owners injuriously affected (such compensation to be ascertained in the manner hereinafter provided), the said land, or such portion thereof as they shall specify, shall vest in the Land Commission:</li>
<li>(5) If an objection has been made and has not been withdrawn, the same shall be inquired into, heard, and determined in open court, the parties interested having been given an opportunity of being heard by a tribunal hereinafter called the tribunal, composed of the Judicial Commissioner and such one of the two Estates Commissioners who shall have, in the first instance, considered the scheme as the Estates Commissioners shall themselves select, together with the Judge of the King's Bench Division of the High Court who is next in order on the rota mentioned in section two, subsection eleven, of the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act, 1907. The said last-mentioned Judge shell preside: </li>

<li>(7) If every objection so made and not withdrawn shall not be over-ruled, then, subject to the

appeal hereinafter mentioned, no further proceedings shall be taken without the consent of the Judicial Commission to acquire the said lands compulsorily for a period of five years:</li>
<li>(8) An appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from any decision of the said tribunal on any question of law, or mixed question of law and fact. The Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction and power, on the hearing of the appeal, to make any order, including an order as to cost, which the tribunal could have made, and the same consequences shall follow upon the making of such an order as would have followed if the same had been made by the said tribunal:</li>

"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Atkinson.</i>)</li></ol></quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03436"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> said that although many of their Lordships had great pleasure in voting for the Amendment of Lord Atkinson, the new clause only appeared upon the Paper that morning and he did not think it would be right that it should pass through their Lordships' House with any assumption that it was anything like a final judgment as to the system on which the compulsory arrangements might be carried out. There were several points which the noble and learned Lord himself suggested he was quite open to consider if Amendments were put down upon them. He more especially called their Lordships' attention to the tribunal which would be established by the adoption of this clause. It was to be composed of the Judicial Commissioner, one of the Estates Commissioners who had, in the first instance, considered the scheme, together with the Judge of the King's Bench Division of the High Court who was next in order on the rota mentioned in Section 2, subsection (11), of the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act, 1907. The noble Earl the Leader of the House had said that he thought Lord Atkinson had been to some extent prolific in the safeguards which he had set up as regarded appeals, and as regarded the hearing of these cases. He (Lord Midleton) did not profess to decide whether there should be three stages or two; three stages as provided by the noble and learned Lord, or two stages&#x2014;the stage of hearing and the stage of appeal. But he was quite certain that nobody would be
<col>1134</col>
satisfied unless there was an absolutely impartial tribunal. By that he meant a tribunal which was not concerned in the taking of the land and which should decide two points&#x2014;the necessity for taking the land and the price which was to be given for it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03437">He could not help thinking there was this weakness in his noble and learned friend's clause, that there were three hearings; the first hearing a hearing of the Estates Commissioners themselves&#x2014;the people who took the land. Then they were to have a second hearing, and then a third. Let them look at the third tribunal. There was an Estates Commissioner, who should have, in the first instance, considered the scheme; a Judicial Commissioner who sat behind him; and a Judge of the High Court, who was to sit with two persons who were already practically parties to what had been arranged. He could not think, speaking as a layman, that that could be a wise provision. In the first place, of course, the landlord did not know whether he would be upheld on a further appeal. In the first hearing he was not altogether free from costs; there were always costs beyond those allowed in representing a case. On a second hearing he had to go before two Estates Commissioners who knew the case and a Judge of the High Court who did not know the case. He believed that everything which his nobl and learned friend claimed, and rightly claimed, as being a danger in the Judicial Commissioners sitting with assessors who knew and had seen the land would be equally felt by a judge of the High Court sitting with two Estates Commissioners both of whom knew and had heard the case before. He thought that was a weakness in the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03438">What he would venture to suggest to his noble and learned friend was that he should reconsider the question before the Report stage, and that whatever might be the Court at a first instance he should give an appeal on the question of taking the land and an appeal also upon price; and that he should not in appeal connect two people who knew the case with one who did not know the case. Speaking personally as a landlord, he knew that if he had carried his case to the original Court and had taken an opinion there he would feel that it would be regarded as litigious to take it to a higher Court. Their Lordships would recognise, too, that in these cases they were not acting against a tenant, against
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0574"/>
<col>1135</col>
somebody who might have his own difficulties as to costs and appeals, but were acting against the Government to whom costs and appeals counted for nothing. Therefore if further appeal was urged there was no inducement to the Estate Commissioners to settle. He quite recognised that his noble and learned friend had been actuated with a desire of the most complete fairness in giving this second appeal, but he could not help hoping he would so phrase his Amendment as to fortify his first Court and. not make an appeal to a second Court necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03439"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said he would be only too happy to consider any suggestions that might be made, but he would like to point out one or two errors into which the noble Viscount had fallen. In the first matter of the Estates Commissioners the landlord was no party whatever to the proceedings. The Congested Districts Board asked the Estates Commissioners to put these compulsory powers into force. Under the Bill the Estates Commissioners had no option but to put those powers into force; the word was "shall." In his Amendment, before deciding to put a scheme into force the Judicial Commissioner, together with two of the Estates Commissioners, had to inquire into the merits of the scheme and satisfy themselves that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case. They did not decide the merits of the thing; they merely decided whether there was a case for an inquiry. If they decided that there was, then for the first time the landlord or any objector came in.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03440">As to the composition of the Court, there were a good many things to be considered. First, it was most undesirable to have a Court composed of four members, because if they should be divided nothing could be done. It was, therefore, better to have it composed of an uneven number, say, three or five, so that there could not possibly be an equal division. It was quite possible that two members of the Court he would create would already have looked into the matter, but that was all. They would not have considered any objections because no objection would have come before them. They only really said, "Shall we start the machinery?" And before starting the machinery they had to satisfy themselves that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case. He did not think the fact that they had inquired into it was any disqualification whatever against their deciding as honest men on the merits of an objection
<col>1136</col>
when an objection was argued out before them. His reason for putting in an Estates Commissioner was that it was desirable to have on the tribunal a person who was acquainted with the workings of the whole purchase system and also with the condition of the property.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03441">There was a good deal of difficulty in constructing the Court of first hearing. It was quite obvious they could not have five members. He thought when he drew up the Amendment that he had constructed about as satisfactory a tribunal as could be constructed for the purpose. Again, he would remind his noble friend that these Courts had nothing whatever to say as to the fixing of the price. They decided whether any land was land that ought to be taken and other questions that might be raised, but the fixing of the price did not belong to them. He did not think the tribunal was fitted for that. So long as there was provision of some tribunal to decide upon the question of the necessity for taking the land he would be glad to consider any Amendment designed to simplify the procedure.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03442"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member> wished to ask one or two questions. The Court of Appeal went into questions of law. Would facts be taken into consideration? He meant such facts as whether the neighbourhood would be injured by the acquisition of certain land. In his opinion a large part of the farms would be injured by the migration of congests. A second point was whether the land to be bought was suitable for sub-division. Much of the land in Galway had been divided, and it should never under any conditions have been subdivided. It was not tillage land, and he did not think it would be advisable for any one to migrate to such land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03443"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> was disposed to agree with the main bearings of the clause but had no doubt it would be exposed to criticism&#x2014;and it challenged criticism&#x2014;on the Report stage.

and learned Lord's Amendment had been accepted as a peg upon which to hang proposals, and the noble Marquess who led the Opposition was disposed to think that on the whole, having regard to the judicial character of the noble and learned Lord's Amendment, he preferred it to his (Lord MacDonnell's). But he believed the noble Marquess thought at the same time that there were in his Amendment also certain good points that were not included in the noble and learned Lord's Amendment. For his own part he considered the whole thing was open, and the only fixed point they had for future discussion was the necessity of some body which should give a decision as to the necessity for the compulsory acquisition of land. Secondly, there was the point of the assessment of price. While the Privy Council in the former case seemed to him a convenient tribunal to adopt he would be very glad to see that tribunal a mixed tribunal; that the members of the Privy Council should not all be Judicial officers but that there should be some laymen on it having a knowledge of the value of land and also able to appreciate the necessities of the country so far as acquisition was concerned. Otherwise he considered the matter was entirely open, and that it would be possible for those of them who wished to do so to move Amendments, even radical Amendments, to whatever proposal might be put upon the Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03445"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think I ought, perhaps, to say one word in order to make the position of the Government perfectly clear. This, of course, is not our Amendment. We voted for it as against certain noble Lords opposite on the ground that it established a principle of possible compulsion as against the complete denial of compulsion which those noble Lords wished to enforce. But of course we do not adopt the clause as it stands. For instance, we certainly do not adopt the application of the Lands Clauses Act to compulsory purchase as the noble and learned Lord proposes. With reference to what has fallen from the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, and from the noble and learned Lord I would merely say this, that as regards any Court of Appeal we should object strongly to any Court before which the Estates Commissioners had to appear as a party to a litigation; that is to say, having fixed a figure or entertained the possibility of compulsory purchase in some
<col>1138</col>
form, we should strongly object to their having to appear before a Court, composed, say, entirely of Judges, as parties to the case. We have never admitted that they become in any sense or at any stage interested parties, and we could not agree to any system which involved their so appearing. It is for that reason that I express something of an adherence to the noble and learned Lord's tribunal because it steers entirely clear of that difficulty and so avoids the principle which I think the noble Viscount rather favours and which we could not possibly admit.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03470"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> moved the omission from the Bill of Clause 67. The clause, he said dealt with a very complicated and technical subject, and the Amendment was one which ought really to be in the hands of a member of the legal profession. He therefore apologised for any shortcomings in dealing with it. The clause dealt with what was known familiarly as the case of the future tenants, and which he would say in passing, His Majesty's Government dealt with in the Bill of 1908, although on that occasion they dealt with it to a very much smaller extent than they had allowed themselves to deal with it in the present Bill. In fact, they knew that the clause was not originally inspired by the Government. The Irish Attorney-General had told them in the House of Commons that it was taken from the Bill of a Nationalist Member, and a clause of such parentage, even after its adoption, had not, he thought, developed into a very satisfactory offspring. Hitherto their Lordships had been discussing how to get rid of dual ownership and of rent fixing or rent reducing, as the Chief Secretary preferred to call it, but this clause was designed to give rent reducing a new lease of life&#x2014;in other words, it gave a new lease of life to a system to get rid of which the British taxpayer was lending Ireland over &#x00A3;100,000,000. Under the Act of 1881 rent fixing was confined to present tenants, and future tenants were excluded. That was done
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0577"/>
<col>1141</col>
for obvious reasons. Future tenancies were not included in the Act of 1881 because the owners of future tenancies obviously owned no tenant rights; they had earned no tenant rights by the making of improvements, and therefore the question of dual ownership in no way arose. But the present Bill would greatly increase the work of the Land Commission by, first, extending the definition of present tenancies for the purpose of this clause, and, secondly, by extending to future tenancies, or to very many of them, the rights h.therto exclusively enjoyed by present tenancies. First of all, as regarded the extension of the definition of present tenancies, if their Lordships would look at the last five lines of the clause they would see that the expression present tenancy included any tenancy which was determined at any time between the first day of January, 1879, and the passing of the Act of 1881. These people now brought in were expressly excluded under the Act of 1881 through their own default before the Act of 1881. In the vast majority of cases the reason for that was that they were in arrears with their rent, and it was not unfair to say that the amount lost by the landlords through these arrears amounted to the redemption of the tenant rights.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03471">The position as regarded those men was really this. Those who were responsible for the Act of 1881 allowed them to be excluded, and now, twenty-eight years afterwards, the Chief Secretary came along and said that the authors of the Act of 1881 did not know their business and that it was now time to include those men for the purposes of this clause. Let it be remembered that these people were in no way in a position of hardship. They had the right to purchase and thousands of them had exercised that right, but in spite of that this clause now came along and opened the Act of 1881 to those who had not purchased. As regarded the second class, the future tenants&#x2014;still using the technical term "future tenants" as tenants who were future tenants regarded from the point of view of the year 1881&#x2014;they were also excluded, and he thought he would be able to show their Lordships rightly excluded from the Act of 1881. As he understood from a study of the book of the Attorney-General for Ireland, they could divide future tenants into four classes, of which the last two only would be affected by this clause. Future tenants were, firstly,
<col>1142</col>
tenants who owned tenancies in which there was no tenancy existing in 1881. Obviously there was no tenant right, and no need for rent-fixing. Secondly they were tenants owing tenancies created after January 1, 1883, in which no tenancy existed in 1881. Again there was no tenant right, and this clause did not attempt to confer it, nor any of the advantages of its possession. The third class consisted of tenants who owned tenancies where the landlord had bought the tenant right in the open market or by desire of the tenant, and this clause would restore the tenant right. It would restore the right of rent-fixing in those cases where the tenancy was still owned by the person who was the tenant when the tenancy was determined, or by his representative, although the landlord might have actually bought the right out. The fourth class of future tenants consisted of tenants in tenancies in which there had been a tenant right, but where that tenant right had been lost by the tenant through his own default, such as the non-payment of rent. This clause would restore to that man the right of having his rent fixed although he had forfeited that right by his own default. He ought perhaps, to say that although these people had hitherto been denied the right of having the rents fixed, their position had not at all been an unfair or a precarious one. If compelled to leave his holding a future tenant was entitled under the present law to compensation for disturbance on a higher scale and to compensation for improvements, and there was a peculiar provision also to the effect that if forced to sell his tenancy&#x2014;he had, of course, a right to sell his tenancy&#x2014;if he were at any time forced to sell his tenancy owing to the fact that the landlord raised his rent, the sale took place subject to the higher rent, and the tenant was entitled to compensation for what presumably was the lower price for which his tenancy was sold owing to the fact that it was sold subject to the increased rent. Therefore he thought that a man in the position of a future tenant was ensured justice, although he claimed there was no ca e whatever for conferring upon him the benefits of rent-fixing which were conferred on tenants who owned a tenant right in 1881.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03472">These future tenants were expressly left out of the Act of 1881 by its authors. But His Majesty's Government, twenty-eight
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0578"/>
<col>1143</col>
years afterwards, were not satisfied with what had been done in 1881, and desired to extend these rent-fixing provisions to the two last classes of future tenants as well as to those to whom they were extending the definition of present tenants. He could, perhaps, sum up what was attempted in a sentence. Mr. Birrell desired to say that if there had ever been a tenancy on any land which for any reason had been put an end to, even if the landlord had put an end to it, or even if the ending had come about by the default of the tenant, if that holding were now in the occupation of a man or his next-of-kin or the legatee of a man who was the owner of the tenant right when the tenancy was determined, he was to be able to go into Court, get his rent fixed in spite of everything that had gone before, in spite of the fact that he accepted the tenancy with his eyes open knowing that he was not to have that right, and in spite of the fact that he might have been compensated in cash for the loss of that right. He claimed that no case whatever existed for a departure from the policy of the Act of 1881, and for this reason he desired to ask their Lordships to strike the clause out of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03473">Before he sat down might he refer to two very small points which occurred in the clause? The first was with regard to subsection (2). They were, of course, accustomed nowadays to provisions forbidding contracting-out, but he thought the provision forbidding contracting-out under this clause was, if possible, more difficult to justify than the usual clause of that kind to which they were accustomed in Factory Acts and Acts of that kind. What was the position? He did not think anyone nowadays would deny that the system set up in the year 1881 was unpopular to everybody in Ireland. It was not only unpopular with the landlords but it was, as they knew from personal experience, unpopular with the tenants. It had discouraged progressive farming, it had discouraged enterprise, and it had bred ill-feeling between two classes who ought to be or could have been mutually dependent on each other. It was not a question of saving the weak from being oppressed. These future tenants were almost invariably men of substance and experience, and yet this clause laid it down for good and all that no man in Ireland was to be allowed to contract out of it.</p>
<col>1144</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03474">The next point to which he desired to call attention was subsection (3) which was really a perfect gem if it were properly understood. He would not read it because he doubted if any layman could understand it. The way it operated was as follows. Their Lordships were aware that naturally everybody disliked eviction, and there was another process often used in place of eviction in Ireland. If a tenant fell very much in arrear with his rent, the landlord, instead of evicting him, brought an action against him for debt. Having obtained judgment the Sheriff seized the farm and sold the tenant right, and that put an end to the tenancy or, to use the phrase in this clause, determined the tenancy. If another farmer bought the tenancy he escaped this section, but if the landlord bought the tenancy himself at public auction the next procedure was for him to get what was known as a writ of ejectment, and while the writ of ejectment was being obtained the tenant remained in temporary occupation of the holding. Is took, of course, some days to get a writ of ejectment. Their Lordships would see what had happened. The tenant was still in the occupation of the holding, and the tenancy had been determined. If that determination took place before the passing of this Act that at once gave the tenant the right to go into Court and get a fair rent fixed, and he was fixed in his farm for fifteen years and nothing could remove him. The position was ridiculous. Here was a man waiting to be turned out by ejectment, and the Government gave him, while he was waiting, the right to go into court and get his rent fixed and so nullify the whole proceedings. Some of their Lordships had had the pleasure at a very interesting inquiry lately of hearing witnesses who spent their lives in trying to concoct ridiculous situations, but he thought the fame of Mr. George Bernard Shaw paled before that of those who drafted this particular clause, the whole of which he now moved to be struck out.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03476"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> did not think the case against the future tenants was quite so bad as the noble Earl had represented. Who were the future
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0579"/>
<col>1145</col>
tenants? When the Act of 1881 was passed there were no future tenants in existence, but after the Act of 1881 was passed certain tenancies were created in land in which a tenancy had never previously existed. Grass lands were cut up, holdings were formed, and tenants were let in. Those were future tenants so far as that went. Also the present tenancies in the course of years became determined, and when a present tenancy became determined after the year 1883 and a new man was let into the tenancy that new man became a future tenant. It was impossible between the passing of the Act of 1881 and January 1, 1883, for a future tenant to obtain a future tenancy in land which had been the subject of a present tenancy when the Act of 1881 was passed; but from the time that the Act of 1881 was passed it was always possible for a cultivator to become a future tenant of a holding which had not previously been made the subject of a tenancy. Now in regard to these future tenants who were allowed to become tenants of land which had never been previously the subject of a tenancy, none of the reasons which the noble Earl had adduced in regard to the other class had prevailed. There was no reason based upon the landlord having bought out the tenancy at all applicable to future tenants of that class, so that apart from the general objection to allow anything like dual ownership in land to grow up in Ireland there was no reason why present tenants of that class should not be allowed to have fair rents fixed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03477">In regard to the other class&#x2014;namely, the class of tenants who were allowed to go into a future tenancy which had been determined&#x2014;he admitted that the arguments of the noble Earl were forcible wherever the landlord had bought up the present tenant rights, but in many instances the landlord did nothing of the sort. If the present tenant was ejected for nonpayment of rent, or the present tenant died leaving no heirs, in all those cases he did not see any reason why a tenant should not be allowed to have a fair rent fixed. At the same time he admitted that the position of the future tenants in Ireland was not so bad as the extreme advocates of the future tenancies pretended. In the first place, if a future tenant came to an agreement with his landlord about rent he got a lease for fifteen years. If at the end of the lease he could not agree with his landlord as to
<col>1146</col>
the terms of rent and elected to go out, he was entitled to compensation, and he also had the right of purchasing his holding; some people might think it an advantage&#x2014;he himself did not&#x2014;but in making his bargain with the landlord he was in no way fettered by the zones, so that the future tenant was not without compensation for his position. At the same time, some future tenants were under none of the obligations to which the noble Earl referred as the successors of present tenants, and in regard to that class of future tenants he had always thought they had a case. The question concerned something like 70,000 tenants in Ireland, and, as the noble Earl had said, the admission of these 70,000 tenants to the advantages of the Land Acts would be the perpetuation of the rent-fixing organisation. He himself thought that was a disadvantage. They ought to look forward to the gradual extinction of the rent-fixing operations in Ireland. For that reason, as well as for those which he had had the honour of laying before their Lordships, he thought that it would be better if they devoted more attention to facilitating land purchase, and thus enabling future tenants to emerge from their present position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03478"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think I ought to say a word upon this. The noble Earl who has proposed the omission of this clause has, I think, given it a somewhat wider scope&#x2014;and that applies to some extent to the noble Lord behind me&#x2014;than was intended by the framers of the Bill. The noble Earl explained what is known to all your Lordships from Ireland and known generally to the House, that speaking at this moment a present tenancy is a past tenancy and a future tenancy is a present tenancy. That is a point which we ought to have in our minds before we proceed to discuss these matters at all. But the particular purpose with which we inserted this provision in the Bill was for the comparatively small class of evicted tenants who were restored to their holdings as future tenants. Now I think the House will agree that the evicted tenants have been a generously treated class, and they were never more generously treated than by noble Lords opposite in the Act of 1903, which said that any tenant who had a holding from 1878 onwards might become a purchasing tenant. That was a very large concession indeed to that class of evicted tenants; but if an evicted tenant had been
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0580"/>
<col>1147</col>
replaced by his landlord as a future tenant, although he might come under that condition, supposing he desired to stay where he was, he could not come under the rent-fixing conditions of the Act of 1881. Those tenants, I take it, do not comprise a very large class of persons. But for their having been evicted and replaced in their holdings they would have been present tenants and entitled to have a rent fixed, but having been out of their holdings, and having been put back, they become permanently and for ever future tenants. There is no desire or intention in this clause of reverting to a great rent-fixing system. That is entirely foreign from its intention. It is not desired to cover more than the small ground I have mentioned, and in those circumstances I should trust your Lordships would agree to pass the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03479"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> said he only desired to point out one thing. The noble Earl had told them he was only thinking of these particular evicted tenants. He thought they all knew what the noble Earl meant by that. That was the purport of the noble Earl's clause of last year, which was vastly extended in the clause before their Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03480"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I cannot help thinking that the explanation of the noble Earl does not entirely meet the case. I would ask the House to remember in what circumstances the future tenant came into existence. In 1881 we recognised that the ordinary Irish tenant, with rare exceptions, was entitled to be given a very strong legal position, because his relation with his landlord was not the ordinary contractual relation but was an hereditary relation, and because the improvements had been made by him. Therefore, it was thought desirable, by common consent, that his position should be made a strong one. But it was perfectly well realised that there might be cases where the position of tenant approximated much more nearly to that of a tenant as understood in other parts of the United Kingdom. I can remember pretty correctly the debates which took place; many supporters of Mr. Gladstone's Irish land policy entertained the hope that gradually future tenancies would become the rule rather than the exception. I think I am right in saying that the late Lord Dufferin was so convinced of the soundness of that view that he spent
<col>1148</col>
large sums in buying up the tenant right on his estate with the idea that he was going to get rid of the Irish system and substitute the contractual system. The effect of the Bill appears to be that in the case of tenants who are holders of a tenancy which was determined between January, 1879, and the passing of the Act of 1881, the tenant is put in the position of being allowed to go into Court and get his rent fixed. These were tenants who were expressly excluded from the Act of 1881. They had lost their tenancies owing to their own fault, and they had no one to blame but themselves if they were left out in the cold. The classes of future tenants with whom the Bill deals are two&#x2014;there are the tenancies where the landlord actually bought up the tenant right, and those where the tenant right was lost by the tenant owing to his own fault. Surely in the case where the landlord has extinguished the tenant right at his own expense or a tenant has got many years into arrear and an arrangement has been made between him and his landlord under which, remember, he retains all the advantages of the future tenant&#x2014;and the advantages of the future tenant are by no means negligible&#x2014;on condition only that he is not allowed free access to the rent-fixing machinery of the Act, it is rather a strong course to tear up the bargain deliberately made and to say that these tenants shall be put in exactly the same position as other tenants and be allowed to have their rents revised from time to time. Would not the effect of this clause be that which we anticipate will be the effect of a great many other clauses in this Bill&#x2014;I mean to throw a new and very onerous burden upon the Land Commissioners? What we all hope &#x2014;at least I hope I am not wrong in saying so&#x2014;is that a day may come when all this ceaseless legislation may be brought to an end, but at every turn the Government prevent the process of extrication from the meshes of land legislation, and insist on weaving new meshes and perpetuating the most unfortunate features of land tenure in Ireland&#x2014;features which, as my noble friend pointed out, this country has been asked to put an end to at great cost to the British taxpayer. I think my noble friend has made out a case, and unless some better reply is vouchsafed I shall accompany him into the Lobby in the event of a Division.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>68.

He desired to address a question to His Majesty's Government. The Chief Secretary for Ireland made a concession to all tenants who entered into purchase agreements up to September 15 in this year. Subsequently a question was put to the Chief Secretary in another place, and from the answer given it was inferred that he would not be averse to advancing the date to "the passing of the Act." Of course their Lordships knew the effect of this concession was only to allow tenants the advantage of the three and a-quarter per cent. annuity and did not give the landlords the claim to the bonus except under the greatly reduced provision of this Bill. But the important part of it was that there were a large number of estates on which agreements had been entered which came fully within the old Act, and on which some tenancies had remained for which tenants were willing to settle on the old terms. He believed there was a further question involved in this which it would be much better to set at rest by the authority of the Government rather than lead to legal action. He believed it was held on good authority that even without the words which were proposed by his noble friend who was absent for the moment, tenants Coming forward before the passing of this Bill had a right to be included in the three and a-quarter per cent. limit, and that legally it could not be removed from them without some actual clause in this Bill. Landlords, of course, had no advantage for bonus except that given under the Act of 1903. Any further distribution of the bonus came under this Bill, according to the tables of the Schedule. The two points he would like the Government to make clear were, Were the tenants not entitled to come forward, up to the date of the passing of the Act, under the three and a-quarter per cent. rate? If that was not so,
<col>1150</col>
were the Government averse to carrying out what his noble friend proposed with the change which he (Lord Midleton) suggested &#x2014;namely, that instead of using the words "before the specified date" the words "before the passing of this Act" should be employed. He pointed out that the Chief Secretary in an answer to a Question in another place had seemed to desire that the change should be made.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03484"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid we cannot accept this Amendment for reasons which I shall endeavour to explain to your Lordships. Its object, I take it, is that in the case of certain tenants who enter into agreements after a date fixed by the Bill the bonus and the purchase annuity should be paid at the old rate and not at the rate decided by the Bill as it stands. Now, as the Bill stands in Part I all the financial arrangements are divided by a clean line with agreements, on the one hand entered into before September 15, 1909, on the other after that date. In the case of future purchase agreements the annuity is at the rate of three and a-half per cent. Then as regards the bonus the old rate is to apply to agreements entered into before September, 1909, and the new rate to apply to agreements after that date. The case with which this clause deals is, I take it, the case where a landlord and his tenant have come to an agreement before the guillotine, so to speak, falls, but the landlord has failed to come to an agreement with other tenants. As the Bill now stands the old rate would apply as regards the agreement entered into before the date; but as regards the agreements entered into after the date the new rate would apply. What is the reason for extending the old rate to the new agreements? You must fix some date and it seems necessary, I think, to draw a distinction between the old
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0582"/>
<col>1151</col>
and new agreements. I do not see why, in order to meet one or two particular cases&#x2014;I believe there is one estate in the North of Ireland in consideration of which this Amendment is brought forward&#x2014;exception should be made in favour of these tenants who have not been able to come to a particular agreement. Of course, it is true there is no compulsion put upon the Estate Commissioners by the Amendment. They "may, subject to the consent of the Treasury." But on the other hand considerable pressure undoubtedly would be put upon them in respect of these particular tenants, and it might involve, if there were many cases, considerable additional charge upon them. In these circumstances we cannot agree to the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

If, on the other hand, the Chief Secretary desired to adhere to the date of September 15 he (Lord Midleton) had no more to say. But he understood that the Chief Secretary found himself in some difficulty in another place on that question, and had come to the conclusion that it would be more equitable to all parties, having regard to the demands of the tenants, that he should fix "the passing of the Bill" instead of "the 15th of September." It rested with the noble Earl whether he desired to draw a thin line between the financial clauses and the clauses they were now engaged upon.</p>

Land in the occupation of a person holding under a fee-farm grant or a lease for lives renewable for ever, or a lease for a term of years of which not less than sixty are unexpired, shall for the purposes of the Act of 1903, the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act, 1907, and this Act, be deemed to be untenanted land.</p>
<col>1152</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03492"><member>LORD ATKINSON</member> said this clause had a rather peculiar history. During the passage of the Bill through the House of Commons the Chief Secretary promised to define untenanted land, and, after having endeavoured to do so, on a subsequent occasion announced that he could not define untenanted land, but he put into the clause now under discussion certain provisos as to what should be regarded as untenanted land. He (Lord Atkinson) proposed an Amendment by which the clause would read as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Land of an annual rateable value not exceeding two hundred pounds, occupied and cultivated as a farm according to a reasonable and proper course of husbandry. or according to the course of husbandry usual in the district in which the same is situated, by a person holding under a fee-farm grant or a lease for lives renewable for ever, or a lease for a term of years of which not less than sixty are unexpired, shall not for the purposes of the Act of 1903, the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act, 1907, and this Act be deemed to be untenanted land."</quote>
Strictly speaking, when a man held under a fee-farm grant he held from a superior landlord, though, in fact, he was the owner of the fee. When he held under a lease which, in most cases, could be converted into a fee-farm grant he was, strictly speaking, a tenant, but in reality he was the owner of the fee. In either of these two cases in a very large tract of country it would be hard to treat him differently from an ordinary owner who had to pay no head-rent. Where a man had a <i>bona fide</i> farm and was using it as a farm and cultivating it in the ordinary course of husbandry, it would be hard that he should be bought out under the Act in order to divide his land among congests and landless men. What he (Lord Atkinson) had tried to aim at was that where a man held a farm not exceeding two hundred pounds a year rateable value under a fee-farm grant or a lease for lives renewable for ever, or a lease for a term of years of which not less than sixty were unexpired, his land should not be considered to be untenanted land, inasmuch as he was a tenant and had cultivated it as a farmer. He thought it would be very unfortunate to buy out farmers of that description and to cover Ireland with small holdings of a ten-pound valuation, so that really there would be no person of any substance or any enterprise, or any education, or any intelligence engaged in the cultivation of land in Ireland. He therefore begged to move the Amendment which would leave <i>bona fide</i> farmers,

But speaking generally on the subject, I am bound to say that I very much doubt whether, if the matter is to be dealt with in this way, it is worth while to retain the clause at all, because if you draw a distinction between a particular class of tenants and name a term and a limit, you will indicate, I think, that all those who are beyond that limit are appropriate subjects for compulsory purchase or any dealings which they may be subject to under the Act.

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03513"><member>LORD MONTEAGLE OF BRANDON</member> had an Amendment on the Paper which would make the First Schedule read&#x2014;
<quote>"The percentage shall be an amount equivalent to two years purchase of the income of the estate or untenanted land.</quote>
<quote>(2) The income of the estate or untenanted land shall be calculated in manner provided by the Treasury."</quote>
He said the Amendment put into shape the criticism which he ventured to make on Clause 5. The present schedule proposed a scale that was in inverse proportion to the number of years purchase, and, therefore, it became the interest of the vendor to take a lower price for the sake of getting a higher bonus. That, he thought, hardly defensible in point of principle. In 1903 there was great difference of opinion in their Lordships' House as to whether the bonus should go to the vendor, and whatever objections were felt by noble Lords in that arrangement were immensely increased by the inverse ratio of the scale in the schedule before them. He proposed instead to fix the sum at a fixed number of years purchase and that that should be added to the amount, so that the bonus in
<col>1156</col>
this form should be not dependent on the number of years purchase but should at the same time represent whatever the number of years purchase was. He had put down two years purchase. That might be considered, perhaps, not adequate in proportion to the bonus originally fixed by the Act of 1903, but he took two years because, roughly speaking, the average bonus under the scale of the Bill seemed to be ten per cent., and taking an average of twenty years purchase ten per cent. would be two years purchase. He thought that if he proposed a higher amount than two years he would be met by the Leader of the House with the argument that he was proposing an addition to the bonus and inflicting an extra charge on the taxpayer. For that reason he confined his Amendment to the modest proposal of two years purchase. He hoped his suggestion would commend itself to their Lordships.</p>

Noble Lords will see that it entirely alters our scheme, not merely because it upsets our plan for fixing the bonus in inverse ratio to the number of years purchase, but also because it does not differentiate in any way between first and second-term rent. I think we should certainly admit from our point of view that my noble friend's Amendment represents an improvement on the law as it now stands, because it does give a bonus which is of a fixed character, and not one which increases according to the higher prices paid to the landlord, as is the case in the existing Act. What would happen under my noble friend's scheme would be this. Supposing the rent was a hundred pounds, the bonus would be two hundred pounds, quite irrespective of the number of years purchase and also irrespective of whether it was a first-term rent, a second-term rent, or a rent which was not judicial at all. Now in the case of twenty-five years purchase on this sum of one hundred pounds the bonus would be eight per cent., in the case of twenty-two and a-quarter years
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0585"/>
<col>1157</col>
nine per cent., in the case of twenty years ten per cent., in the case of eighteen years eleven per cent., and so on. I am afraid in spite of what my noble friend said that the bonus would work out on a considerably higher scale than that which we contemplate in the Bill. We make out that for twenty-five years it would be eight per cent., and as the number of years purchase descends the bonus would in proportion be so much higher. We make out that under my noble friend's scheme the average bonus would be something between nine and ten per cent. as against seven and a-half per cent. which we provide for, so far as we can calculate under our sliding scale. Then as regards the difference between first and second-term rents. A first-term rent of &#x00A3;100 might be calculated at something between &#x00A3;80 and &#x00A3;90; a second-term rent at &#x00A3;85. What would happen under the scheme of my noble friend? In the case of the first-term rent the landlord would get &#x00A3;200, whereas in the case of the second-term rent he would get &#x00A3;170 bonus, although there was no apparent reason why he should receive the higher bonus in the one case any more than in the other. I am afraid although I quite recognise the intention of my noble friend, that his scheme would not work quite fairly, apart from the fact, which to us is the crucial one, that it would considerably increase the amount required for the bonus as compared with what we, suggest in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

Whether that was the best possible arrangement or not, it was clear that the landlord knew perfectly when he made an agreement how much he would receive as bonus. In the case of the sale of untenanted land, however, this was quite uncertain. It was enacted that the number of years purchase represented by an advance should be calculated in the manner prescribed by the Treasury. The second subsection of his Amendment was necessary because very often in Ireland accounts were not kept so accurately in the case of farms as they

He had spoken so often about the manner in which the Estates Commissioners fixed prices that he was sorry to repeat the same thing <i>ad nauseam</i>, but he must point out that the value of the land was fixed as a rule by the valuer sent down from the Estates Commissioners to value the land on a basis of perhaps twenty-six and a-half years purchase. If that was to be accepted as the value of the land it would follow that no bonus would be paid at all. He would like to know whether or not that was intended. He did not know if his Amendment was against privilege, but he thought that at any rate their Lordships had a right to know what were the intentions of the Government with regard to this. He thought they might claim that Parliament and not the Treasury should decide what bonus was to be paid and the manner in which the bonus was to be calculated in the case of untenanted land. He felt very strongly on that point and would be inclined to press the matter to a Division unless the noble Earl could tell him exactly on what scale the Treasury proposed to fix these bonuses.</p>

a largely deciding factor, but I think having regard to the varying circumstances of different cases it would not be reasonable to say that that is to be the only factor in the case. There may be circumstances which would make it clear that in some cases letting value might represent a larger capital value than in other cases. The noble Lord has provided for a very considerable number of cases where the land has not been let. I am sure your Lordships would not see the landlord suffer in any way in consideration of the fact that he could not let his land owing to estate controversies or some other reason. The noble Lord has also tried to provide for the case where the vendor's rents do not show what his profit is. In certain cases it must be extremely difficult for a man to calculate what he has made out of a particular piece of untenanted land. He might work it in conjunction with his home farm or demesne, and he could not possibly say what particular share in his farm accounts that land ought to bear. Therefore in all those cases and in a great many other cases you would have to go back to what seems to me a reasonable rule to take in all cases&#x2014;namely, that of valuing, of looking at all land as the valuer looks at it when making out what it is worth &#x2014; and distribute the bonus accordingly. I am afraid the elaborate system suggested by the noble Lord would not be of assistance to the Estates Commissioners, and I do not think it would prove in any case to be a real safeguard or assistance to landlords, or do what I suppose the noble Lord would like it to do, give them a larger bonus than they would otherwise obtain.</membercontribution></p>

Sometimes they got &#x00A3;200, &#x00A3;300, and &#x00A3;400 a year, and they did that for ten or even twenty years. Surely it was unfair, if that had been going on for many years, to exclude that obvious way of arriving at the value. They had that method as a governing principle in ascertaining the value. The thing was not so complicated that an easy solution could not be arrived at.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03526"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> said he had not the smallest wish to assist the Estates Commissioners. He looked upon them as the party who were purchasing the land, and therefore the party against whom the landlord ought to be protected. The noble Earl thought that the valuer would have to decide, but he had not told them who the valuer was to be. Was the purchasing body going to be the valuer? Were the Estates Commissioners going to be the valuers as to the price the land would fetch, or was there going to be an independent valuer?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03527"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I can quite understand that my noble friend should desire to lay down some principle for the valuation of untenanted land, because as we are aware principles have been laid down in the <i>obiter dicta</i> of high officials which do not entirely command the approval of those most interested. The plan proposed by my noble friend is founded upon absolutely sound principles. He desires that the value should be based, not upon conjecture, but upon actual facts&#x2014;the receipts during a number of years and the annual profit which is disclosed by the vendor's books; and I think the noble Earl opposite himself considers that that is not an unreasonable way of proceeding. But I am under the impression that at some points this proposal may be one not very easy to give effect to, and it seems to me that the necessity for a precautionary clause of this kind depends very much upon the kind of tribunal that we get. If the Bill were to remain in such a position that it was the Commissioners themselves who had to decide both whether the untenanted land should be bought and also what measure of compensation ought to be given and what amount of bonus was to be received by the vendor, then I think there would be a strong case for some such words as are proposed in this Amendment. I was going to suggest to the noble Lord who moved the Amendment that he might, perhaps, reserve the point until we see what tribunal we get in the final form this Bill may assume, because although we have accepted the Amendment of Lord Atkinson the point is still to some extent in suspense. I would therefore suggest that my noble friend's proposal might well be held over until another stage.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03533"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> wished to point out the grave objections there were to the schedule from the point of view of the remainder man. He appreciated from the point of privilege that their Lordships had no power to alter the schedule, but there were grave objections to it from the point of view of the remainder man. If the vendor were induced, by being given a very large rate of bonus, to sell his estate at a low rate of purchase he put the whole of that money into his pocket. He need hardly point out that the remainder man was going to do very badly if a vendor behaved in that way. There were sometimes slight inconsistencies in the proposals in the Bill and in the arguments put forward by members of the Government. His mind carried him back to Clause 14 dealing with the zones, on which the Lord Chancellor argued that one of the great desirabilities of holding inquiries as to equity of price was to safeguard the interests of the remainder man.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03534"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I confess I do not exactly follow what the noble Earl means. The temptation to which he has just alluded&#x2014;namely, that of taking a shorter number of years purchase in order to pocket the bonus&#x2014;made necessary the protection which we proposed to give in Clause 14 of allowing the Land Commissioners to inquire into the equity of the price. We held that that was one of the points which they ought to take into consideration, and it made that
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0588"/>

inquiry more necessary than it would be if we had adhered to the fixed bonus. Although we think the fixed bonus wrong for reasons which I have stated before, I see nothing inconsistent in the argument, to which reference has been made. If you do not allow the Estates Commissioners to inquire into the equity of the price you do undoubtedly run the risk of that happening under the schedule to which the noble Earl has referred and I have no doubt it will happen in some cases.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03547"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the noble Earl the Leader of the House a Question of which I have given him private notice&#x2014;namely, if he can tell us anything with regard to the course of business next week, and perhaps during the following week. Noble Lords from Ireland are naturally anxious to know what opportunities they will have of discussing the Irish Land Bill on Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03548"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the business for to-day and to-morrow is set out on the Paper, and that it will not be for the convenience of noble Lords from Ireland to take the Report stage of the Irish Land Bill before Tuesday, the 19th. In that case I would suggest, with your Lordships' concurrence, that the House need not sit on Monday next as there will be no business to take on that day. I am not certain how long the Report stage of the Irish Land Bill will take, but in the event of its being finished on Tuesday we propose to take the Committee stage of the Development Bill on Wednesday, the 20th. That is supposing the Land Bill Report does not take more than one day, but if it should occupy two days then we should propose to take the Development Bill on Thursday, the 21st. Then there is the remaining stage of the Scottish House Letting Bill which we propose to take on Wednesday, the 20th, or Thursday, the 21st. As to the following week, there remains the Third Reading of the Irish Land Bill and the remaining stages&#x2014;Report and Third Reading&#x2014;of the Development Bill, and we propose to devote Monday and Tuesday to those two Bills; it is not, I think, necessary or desirable to say at the moment which Bill will be taken on each day, because we should prefer to meet the convenience of noble Lords. That is so far as I know the business before the House, and unless further business should appear on the Paper, I should think it would be possible for your Lordships to adjourn for a few days on Tuesday, the 26th.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03552" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03553">Order of the Day for the Second Reading, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03554"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill to insure the provision of pensions to asylum workers in England, Scotland, and Ireland. As the present law stands in England and Ireland there is permissive power given to local authorities to grant these pensions, but in Scotland there is no permissive power at all. The object of this Bill is to provide for uniformity of pensions all over the country, and to provide security of pensions to all asylum workers. I do not think in your Lordships' House, where so many of your Lordships have experience of local government and through your visiting committees know much of asylums, that it is necessary I should say much as to what a deserving class this is for which this Bill is intended. It is a dangerous profession and one very trying to the nerves, and there are a great many breakdowns among asylum workers. This Bill is intended to provide similiar conditions for these asylum workers as is already enjoyed by the prison service and the police. Your Lordships have already given your assent to the principles of this Bill when you passed the Second Reading of a
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0590"/>
<col>1167</col>
Bill which was moved by the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, in the year 1898, and which provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"It shall be the duty of the visiting committee of every asylum to grant superannuation allowance to their officers and servants, and the allowance shall be not less than one-sixtieth of the value of the salary and emoluments for each year of service."</quote>
This Bill, the Second Reading of which I am now moving, has passed the House of Commons. It was referred there to a Select Committee, and that Committee reported unanimously in its favour, and their evidence, which is a very strong argument for this Bill, shows that the asylum service suffers from the lack of a uniform pension system. It was shown that in Scotland the workers leave very largely for the prison service, and that in England they leave for the police and the Poor Law.<lb/>
This Bill divides asylum workers into two classes. For the first class, which is the more favoured class, it provides that if they are fifty years old and have worked for fifteen years in an asylum they shall be entitled to one-fiftieth of their salary and emoluments for each year of service. The second class is to be twenty years in an asylum, sixty years old, and is to receive one-sixtieth of the salary and emoluments for each year of service. The intention is that those who have the care and charge of the insane and who have the danger and responsibility of the profession, should be in the first class and should get the more favoured treatment, and that the second class should consist of those who are workers in the asylum but have not the same danger, though they are exposed to that nerve strain which is inevitable to those who have contact with lunatics. The Bill does not provide as to how those classes are to be settled. The decision is left to the local authority. It would be impossible to put it into an Act of Parliament, and the local authority who administer the asylum are obviously the best people to decide this matter. Clauses 7 and 8 of this Bill provide for contributions in the form of a sort of deferred pay from the asylum workers for their pensions. That is, two per cent. of salary and emoluments. In saying that let me call your Lordships' attention again to the clause which I read from Lord Halsbury's Bill, which provided one-sixtieth as the scale of superannuation. This Bill provides one-fiftieth, but the difference
<col>1168</col>
between the two Bills is that there are contributions in this case and there were none in the other, and consequently the difference between one-fiftieth and one-sixtieth is discounted in that respect.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there is a provision in the Bill with regard to existing servants. As they have paid no contributions in the past they are to be charged a higher contribution, but if they object, under Clause 13, they are permitted to contract out and to remain as they were. Then there is another provision for those who are injured in their work after ten years service. They are to have pensions. I propose, if this Bill gets to the Committee stage, as I hope it will, to move an Amendment to provide that a local authority may grant gratuities or pensions in special cases of injury, even when workers have been less than ten years in the service, but it is to be a permissive and not a compulsory Amendment as regards a local authority. Clause 4 contains the principles of aggregation in reckoning service; that is to say, when a man has worked under one local authority and he moves to the asylum of another local authority he will not lose pension service by doing so. The object of that is to better the profession, to provide for more interchange, and to extend the horizon of asylum workers. There is, I think, another lack in the Bill. I did not draft it, and it is not my fault. There is no machinery in the Bill to provide that one local authority may recover from another local authority money in respect of pensions. That is a want which I hope to remedy in Committee if His Majesty's Government do not suggest a clause.<lb/>
The whole Bill is to provide uniformity of treatment. At the present time a great many local authorities say that they will judge the cases of these people on their merits. A local authority may be in an economical mood or it may be in a generous mood, and the pension which a man gets depends very largely on the frame of mind of the local authority at the moment. Consequently there is injustice. Then there is another point which is remedied by the Bill. There are cases of one asylum serving a number of counties. I believe in the case of the county of Denbighshire that is one of a group of five counties which have one asylum. When an officer in that asylum wants a pension his pension has to run the gauntlet of five local authorities, and, consequently,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0591"/>
<col>1169</col>
if two of these authorities are at loggerheads with one another about something quite different, this man's pension may be prejudiced. That is an evil which is got rid of by this Bill.<lb/>
Now I would come to some of the objections, and I do not think there are many, which can be raised to this Bill. I do not think your Lordships will say that this is an interfering Bill. There have been many interfering Bills which have put officials in Whitehall over the elected representatives of the people in the county councils, but this is not one of them. This Bill only enforces what is the common practice of local authorities in England and Ireland with regard to pensions. It is very difficult to discover what is the attitude, or what is likely to be the attitude, of local authorities towards a Bill of this kind. I believe if you circularise local authorities with regard to a Bill which is pending before Parliament it comes into the hands either of the clerk of or one man in the local authority. He states his views with regard to it, and the whole local authority votes without having seen the Bill or knowing what it contains, and therefore I do discount opinions which are given by local authorities with regard to Bills pending in Parliament. But I understand that the County Councils Association have circularised their counties throughout England with regard to the Bill, and the only objections, so far as I know, are given in the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons. I do not know of any others.<lb/>
I should like to call your Lordships' attention to the objectors. In the first place, there is the Asylums Board of Lancashire. I am very much surprised to see that board quoted as an objector. I can only say that I have spoken with the chairman of that board, that he is in favour of the Bill and has authorised me to say so, and that he was not aware that his board objected. Then there is the West Riding of Yorkshire. Well, the West Riding of Yorkshire had a representative before the Committee. I do not know whether he came to curse the Bill, but he ended by blessing it, and by telling the Committee that though they objected to some of the details of the Bill they did not object to its principles. Then there is the County Council of East Sussex, of which I have the honour to be a member. I know the story of the resolution passed
<col>1170</col>
by the East Sussex County Council, and although I will not inflict it upon your Lordships I do not think their opposition is serious. Then there is the Visiting Committee of Leicestershire, which is merely a visiting committee, and there is the County Council of Nottinghamshire. Really I think the opposition comes down to the County Council of Nottinghamshire. There is a resolution, which is also quoted, by the Municipal Corporations Association. Now the Municipal Corporations Association are not the municipal corporations, and I must say I discount a resolution of theirs as well. They say they would prefer to have a wide scheme for pensioning all the servants of all local authorities. I ask your Lordships, Is that a question of practical politics at the present moment? I do not think it is, and, in any case, the claim of this Bill for preferential treatment for asylum workers is that they are in a dangerous profession. That has been the practice of Parliament throughout. Since 1845 they have been selected as people who are in a dangerous profession. In the same way, in 1890, under the Police Act, the police were given preferential treatment because they were in a dangerous profession, and I believe that in the London County Council you find that the members of the fire brigade are given special treatment because they are in a dangerous profession. That is the ground on which I urge this Bill.<lb/>
The other objection to this Bill, I suppose, is the question of expense. No doubt the Police Act raised the rates. I would make any objector to this Bill a present of that; but I would point out that there are a number of local authorities at the present time, notably Lancashire and the London County Council&#x2014;who, by the way, are in favour of this Bill&#x2014;who are more generous to their asylum workers at the present time than the provisions of this Bill. Consequently, one may say that they would be gainers in that respect, and that that would be an economy. But I must go into an argument which has been urged on the other side with great force in a Memorandum which was issued by Mr. Jarman of the National Debt Office. In that Memorandum it is pointed out that the object of this Bill is to give stability to the asylum service. If you succeed in giving stability to the asylum service you will increase necessarily the number of pensions, and consequently, it was said,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0592"/>
<col>1171</col>
the asylum service would be as expensive as the police service had proved. There are several answers to that, and I feel it my duty, even at the risk of wearying your Lordships, to give them to you. The asylum service is different from the police service for this reason. There always must be a great number of early withdrawals from the asylum service. A great number of attendants are young girls who invariably leave on marriage; and many asylum attendants will always leave, early because of the unattractive nature of the service; people will never stay in it in the same way as they do in the police. A point on which I would like to lay stress is that in the police a man is pensioned according to the salary he is receiving when he goes out of the service. Under this Bill an asylum worker has to be paid on the average he has been receiving for the last ten years, and for that reason, my Lords, I would point out that there is very good ground for saying that this Bill will not have any appreciable effect on the rates either one way or the other.<lb/>
I must say a word with regard to the scale, because Scotland is in an entirely different position. This Bill provides for the same conditions of pension in district and parochial asylums in Scotland. It does not affect Royal asylums, which are a different class of institution in Scotland, and are very like our hospitals, although they take pauper lunatics. At the present time there is not even a permissive law to allow local authorities to give these pensions in Scotland, and with that object a Bill was introduced this session in another place. In the vicissitudes of its course it met this other Bill from England and Ireland, and it got amalgamated with it, and there now comes before your Lordships one Bill for England, Ireland, and Scotland. Dr. Johnson, who gave evidence on behalf of the District Asylums of Scotland, speaking of the anxiety of local authorities to grant these pensions, said that sometimes an asylum authority, when an officer wished to retire, made him a consultative officer, although they never consulted him, but merely to give him a pension; and in another case they made him a gate-keeper merely to get round the law. Then Mr. Spence, the Secretary of the General Lunacy Board, gave very important evidence that every year in Scotland one-third of all the <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i> in asylums go out, seventy-five per cent. of their own accord.<lb/>
<col>1172</col>
This shows what a very transitory service this is in Scotland. It is very much more transitory than the prison service, and the reason given is that there is no security with regard to pensions. If there is this transitory service in Scotland it must follow it is very bad for the patients. I am not going to say that this Bill can become law without affecting rates in Scotland, but I do say that I cannot understand why an asylum worker in Scotland should be in a wholly different category from one in England or Ireland. They are entitled to the same consideration, and I think they should be included in this Bill. I understand that there have been no objections from lunacy boards in Scotland to this Bill, and although the time has been short I have been given a list of seven lunacy boards in Scotland who are anxious for it.<lb/>
I would say a word with regard to Ireland. I was handed a telegram this morning which stated that all the county councils in Ireland except two have approved of this Bill. It was given in evidence before the Committee in another place that seventy per cent. of the officials of the asylums in Ireland were favourable to it, and of the remaining thirty per cent. I believe half have not answered and the other half belong to one particular asylum which give such exceptionally good pension treatment that they do not think they will be so well off under this Bill. There was also very good evidence given that there was an unequal treatment in different asylums in the granting of pensions. I am not altogether surprised at it, although I do not know much about Ireland. The authorities that give these pensions in Ireland are the same authorities that have achieved some prominence in their management of the Old Age Pensions Act. I venture to think there should be some discipline introduced in these local authorities with regard to their distribution of pensions for asylum workers. I should like to tell your Lordships two stories from Ireland with regard to it, and which, I think, are better than any argument. There was an attendant in an asylum in Ireland who got a crack on the head. In consequence of that he became an epileptic. Being obliged to retire he applied for a pension but was only given a gratuity of &#x00A3;25. The poor man eventually lost his reason and became a patient in the asylum in which he had formerly been an attendant. In the same asylum there was another man
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0593"/>
<col>1173</col>
of about the same age and service, and he took to drink. The visiting committee wanted to get rid of him so they gave him a pension for the rest of his life. This is the other story. There was a doctor of an asylum who thought it his duty to condemn the meat brought to the asylum as being putrid. A member of the visiting committee was the contractor who supplied the meat. The contractor told the doctor that he would take care that he suffered for what he had done, and if this Bill does not pass I have no doubt he will. There are in your Lordships' House many noble Lords from Ireland who can speak with more confidence than I can with regard to this matter, but I think, first, that there is a great want of uniformity in the distribution of pensions in Ireland, and I believe that noble Lords from Ireland will agree that there is no objection on the part of the Irish local authorities. The whole Bill is to provide for a uniform and comprehensive scheme to give security to these workers, so that under whatever local authority they serve they shall be in the same position as regards pension. That will raise the profession and will be in the interests of the insane. These officials are not known to the public. Everybody knows the local policeman and his desserts, but nobody knows the desserts of workers in asylums, and I think they have a peculiar claim on your Lordships' consideration. They are most highly-tried officials, and I would ask your Lordships, after this Bill has got thus far, not to refuse it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03555">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Monk Bretton.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03556"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it would be convenient at this early stage of the discussion to put before your Lordships a few considerations which I think ought to carry some weight before this Bill is read a second time. I regret I am not able to speak on behalf of the County Councils Association. Since the Bill passed its Second Reading in the other House the County Councils Association issued a circular to all the county councils of England asking for their opinion about this Bill, and up to this time there has been only a very limited number of replies. I noticed what was evidently a communicated statement in <i>The Times</i> a few days ago, in which it was said that nineteen county councils had passed resolutions in favour of the Bill. All I can say is that if that referred to
<col>1174</col>
county councils in England and Wales it is absolutely incorrect. The statistics which we have got are that seven county councils and six asylum committees have declared in favour of the Bill and three county councils and two asylum committees have sent in replies in the other sense.<lb/>
I am bound to say that when my noble friend tried to explain away all the resolutions that have been come to by county councils against the Bill he was skating, I thought, on rather thin ice. Of course, I will leave it to him to explain why his own county council came to a resolution against the Bill when their real opinion was in its favour; but I cannot accept the statement he made with regard to the West Riding County Council, because not only did they oppose this Bill through one of their officers, but since the Bill has passed through the other House they have sent a memorial to the Home Office laying down their objections to the Bill in quite clear terms. Therefore no possible suggestion can be made that the West Riding of Yorkshire are in favour of the Bill as it stands. In their memorial the West Riding County Council and the West Riding Asylums Committee, which latter body represents the county boroughs of Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield and Rotherham as well as the county council, expressed their desire to secure certain Amendments which appear to be essential to the Bill if the Bill is to go through, and suggested that the Bill should be made adoptive, but that if it is to be made obligatory on all authorities its provisions deserve better consideration if they are to be acceptable to the Asylums Committee. As I understand, the promoters of the Bill would construe it as opposition to the principle of the Bill if it were made adoptive instead of compulsorily. I believe they stand to what they call the principle of the Bill, that every authority should be obliged to adopt it whether they like it or not. What I wish to submit to your Lordships is that the Bill having passed through the other House, as I think I can show, without any discussion, at all events the principle Of the Bill should be discussed in this House, and that consideration should be given to the question whether it is absolutely necessary that the Bill should be made compulsory. I am quite willing to recognise all the arguments of my noble friend with regard to the principle of this Bill. I quite recognise that the officers in favour of whom this Bill is

brought forward are officers who require protection and who, if anybody, should have a satisfactory system of pension; but it seems to me if that is to be done some consideration should be given to those who have to find the money, to decide whether the terms of the Bill are reasonable or not, and, at all events, that some discussion more than has been given in the other House should be devoted to the question whether it is absolutely necessary that this Bill should be made compulsory.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, let me call attention to what has really taken place with regard to this Bill, because I think there is a great deal of misunderstanding. Your Lordships would suppose that if a Bill had been in the other House for six or seven months its principle would have had full discussion, and that after full discussion in that House it had been referred to a Select Committee to consider its details. Nothing of the sort. I have searched through <i>Hansard</i> for every stage of the Bill, and so far as <i>Hansard</i> shows not a single word has been said either in favour or against this Bill on any stage. It passed its Second Reading without any discussion and was referred to a Select Committee without any discussion. It came back with important Amendments inserted in the Bill, and so far as the <i>Hansard</i> reports show there was no discussion on the Report of the Select Committee. It passed the Third Reading in the same way, and therefore I feel it my duty, having some responsibility to the county councils of this country, at all events to do my best to see that the views of the minority should not be overlooked in this House.<lb/>
It may be said, of course, that all the discussion took place in the Select Committee, and that the provisions of the Bill were thoroughly sifted before that Committee. I have no wish to take exception to, or to attempt to criticise, the manner in which the members of the Committee in the other House carried out the duties entrusted to them by that House, but I would venture to say that I think the question as to whether it is desirable in a matter of this sort that the local authority should be compelled to adopt a scheme whether they like it or not hardly received any consideration in the Committee more than it did in the House. I notice that, although there were ten independent witnesses called&#x2014;in addition to the promoter of the Bill, or at all events, the gentleman who explained the
<col>1176</col>
Bill (Dr. Shuttleworth) and Mr. Byrne, the witness for the Home Office&#x2014;six of those ten witnesses were doctors. Five of the ten came from Scotland, two from Ireland, and there were only three from England who expressed any views with regard to this Bill. One represented the West Riding, and another represented West Ham. Those two gentlemen took very opposite views, and got into a little contest with each other as to whether the West Riding scheme was a liberal one or not. I am only alluding to that because I do think it shows that at all events the points which I wish to bring before the House have not been discussed in the other House in any way.<lb/>
If you read the Report of the Committee it would appear as if everybody was in favour of the main principles of this Bill, and I notice in the Report the Lunacy Commissioners are quoted as being strongly in favour of a scheme of this sort. I think that goes without saying. No doubt it is the duty of the Lunacy Commissioners to do what they can to promote the interests of the officers of whose duties they know so much; but I am bound to say that nobody would think of going to the Lunacy Commissioners if they wished the question of the interests of the ratepayers to be considered in any way; in fact, in past days I had some experience of the Lunacy Commissioners, and I found that in matters which caused expense they certainly were not reluctant to impose regulations which the county councils often thought unnecessary with regard to the building of asylums. I think that is very much changed at the present day, but I only mention it to show that you do not look to the Lunacy Commissioners to protect the ratepayers.<lb/>
The Bill of my noble friend Lord Halsbury has been alluded to, and I think my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton went so far as to say that the principle having been approved in 1898 it showed approval of the principle of this Bill. But what really happened with regard to the Bills introduced by the noble and learned Earl? Every one of those Bills split on the rock of whether a compulsory system of pensions should be embodied in the Bill or not. I find that in 1898, on the Second Reading of the Bill which has been referred to, two most interesting speeches were made by very prominent members of this House on this very point. Let me say, first, however, that I quite understood that the noble and
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0595"/>
<col>1177</col>
learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, in introducing those Bills, always laid it down as an axiom that it was for Parliament to consider whether it wished to adopt a compulsory system of this kind or not, and, therefore, it seems to me it is all the more reason for calling the attention of this House to the matter as it has not been considered in the other House of Parliament. Now the two noble Lords from whose speeches I wish to give some very short extracts perhaps had a larger knowledge of local government than any members of this House. They were both leaders of the other side of the House, and I would commend to the noble Earl the present Leader of the House some of the remarks which were made by those who filled the position he now occupies. The first words I should like to quote are from the speech of the late Lord Kimberley, who said&#x2014;
<quote>"When we consider the authority which the county councils possess throughout the country and their representative character, I think it is extremely undesirable, unless a very strong necessity arises, to do otherwise than leave them a free discretion with reference to the expenditure on the maintenance of lunatics. It is very desirable that county councils should feel that they have entrusted to them the real business which comes under their control. If you go too far in laying down what they should do you will weaken the authority of the county councils very seriously, and the result will be that you will not get men of the same position to take posts in the management of the various matters which come under the administration of the county councils."</quote>
He went on to say what I would commend to the consideration of the House&#x2014;
<quote>"We could not do worse than increase the functions of the Government with regard to local affairs. I feel very indisposed to limit in any way the discretion which those bodies now enjoy."</quote>
That was not only the opinion of Lord Kimberley. Lord Ripon, who also had a wide knowledge of local affairs, spoke on the same occasion. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It should not be made compulsory on county councils to spend money in this manner if they do not think fit. Speaking generally, I have always thought it a mistake to enforce expenditure on county councils by Act of Parliament. I venture to submit that it is only reasonable that county councils should ask that this matter should be left to their discretion,"</quote>
Now, my Lords, those two opinions are very forcible in language and would have much more effect than any words of mine. But I do venture to say this. If those words were spoken some time ago, at all events the principles of local government
<col>1178</col>
are the same now, although they are not recognised so widely as they were by those two noble Lords. I would suggest that in these matters which cause a considerable expense to county councils it is not quite fitting that they should be entirely ignored with regard to any consultation as to the effects of a Bill of this kind, especially as they have some part in administering the Acts.<lb/>
I should like to make one or two remarks on the question of finance, because it is somewhat important although the noble Lord who introduced this Bill tried to minimise the effect. I cannot help thinking that the Committee did not come to any very decided conclusion as to what the effects of this Bill were likely to be. There were two members of the Committee who gave it as their opinion that as there had been a very small amount spent on pensions that would be likely to be the case in the future; but Mr. Jarman, to whom Lord Monk Bretton has already referred, entirely upset any of those calculations, although he only put it in a Memorandum and was not examined as a witness. He said that if the Superannuation Bill would have the effect of inducing officials to remain in the service as anticipated, the proportion of seven per cent. might in the course of time increase to twenty per cent. or more, as in the case of the police service, where the pension is somewhat similar to that proposed in the present Bill. I cannot help thinking that if the Committee had taken a little more trouble to go further into this matter they would have come to the conclusion not only that that was proved but that if you are going to compare the pensions to be given under this Bill with the pensions given under the Police Act there are certain circumstances which show that the charge would be very much higher than it was in the case of police pensions. The county councils of England at the present time pay enormous sums out of the rates in aid of the police funds, which are insufficient. I have got nine or ten counties, not picked out as being specially large, but some of them large counties&#x2014;and the largest of these goes as high as &#x00A3;4,200, which is to be found out of the rates towards the police pensions. The average of the nine or ten is over &#x00A3;2,000 a year. The Government allow &#x00A3;300,000 a year for this purpose, but not a penny will be obtained from it for the superannuation of asylum officers if this Bill is passed, besides which in the early days, when the police pension
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0596"/>
<col>1179</col>
system was adopted, there were a great many young officers in the force who could not call on the fund for many years, with the result that a substantial sum was accumulated, and that helped very considerably to meet the pensions.<lb/>
My Lords, this is not the occasion on which to go more into details with regard to a matter of that sort, but I do think at all events it shows that the question of the expense to those who have to administer the Bill and pay for it ought to have had more consideration before it came to this House. With regard to the scales in the Bill, let me only say that a very strong case has been made out for those officers who are in direct contact with lunatics, especially dangerous lunatics, and who are exposed to all the disagreeable circumstances as well as the danger of their profession. I think a very strong case can be made out for a pension for those officers, and, if it is proved to be necessary, a compulsory pension. But when you come to include, as von include in this Bill, every labourer, every clerk, every man who works in the garden, every woman who works in the asylum, you are setting a precedent for compelling county councils to give pensions to all their officers in every branch of the work. Why should a clerk who attends the meetings of the asylums committee have more right to a pension than the clerk who attends the highways committee or any other committee? If you adopt this scale in the Bill, I venture to think you will be making not only a most dangerous precedent with regard to the county councils, but a precedent for giving many other people who are in a somewhat similar position a very much larger pension than they are receiving at the present time.<lb/>
I am quite aware that if we move Amendments&#x2014;and I hope Amendments may be moved to this Bill&#x2014;we are in a very dangerous position. I am told that if we touch the scale of the pensions it may raise the question of privilege. I am not one of those who are very much inclined to set up for ourselves the bogey of privilege in this House, and I am quite sure that the House of Commons can take care of themselves with regard to that matter. But if we put in Amendments which are privileged, as has been the case in many other Bills, they might not be considered on their merits. Though it is possible for the other House to waive its privilege in cases where they think it desirable, I do not see what assurance we would
<col>1180</col>
have that our Amendments would not be struck out without consideration, and when the Bill came up ill its final stage we should have lost the opportunity of amending it. I can only say that if noble and learned Lords who have had better experience in this matter than I have can make any suggestion which will help us to put Amendments into this Bill I shall be only too happy, but I am bound to say that if the Bill is to be passed without amendment I shall retain full discretion to take action on the Third Reading.<lb/>
There is one other point to which I wish to refer, and it is a very important one. There was a clause put into this Bill in the Select Committee without any allusion being made to it in the Report, and no allusion has been made to it by my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton, and, so far as I know, not many members of this House are aware of it at all. It is Clause 14, which lays down the manner in which the payment of allowances and gratuities should be made. Hitherto the county council has paid over all pensions which are imposed by the asylum committee, and those pensions have to come up for confirmation by the county council. If the clause stands as it is that charge will be taken off the county council and put upon the guardians. It will be part of the fund out of which the salaries or wages of officers and servants in the asylum are payable and to which the necessary sum for pensions will be added. That makes very little difference, of course, so far as the ratepayers are concerned, because whether the rates are raised by the county council or by the board of guardians it comes to the same thing in the end; but this clause is accompanied by a provision which repeals a section of an Act of Parliament under which it is said that any pension must come for confirmation to the county council. If you are going to do away with this power of confirmation you will be putting nothing in its place. You are making the asylums committee even more absolute than they are at the present moment, and there is no authority who will be able to have any say as to whether the particular pensions are desirable or not. Anybody who knows the administration of lunatic asylums knows that the law with regard to the visiting committee is very anomalous at the present moment. In most of the matters under their administration the county council have no control over them whatever. They have to fix the salaries of the officers, and the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0597"/>
<col>1181</col>
only power the county council have, if dissatisfied, is to decline to re-elect these members to the visiting committee. That is a power which is very difficult to carry out because it is not so easy always to get responsible men to take that position, especially as the work is not a very pleasant one and it takes many gentlemen a great distance from their homes. I am bound to say that if there is any alteration to be made in the law in this respect it would be far more desirable to give greater control to the county council than to do away with this one matter of control over pensions. That is all I have to say with regard to this Bill.<lb/>
I can assure your Lordships that I feel very considerable responsibility in laying before the House the objections which I have to some of the provisions of the Bill. I am perfectly aware that if I wished to move the rejection of this Bill it would be said that I was opposed to the principle of giving pensions to these deserving people. I have no such feeling, but I do wish to insure that the views coming from the side of the ratepayers and from the side of those who may have to administer this part of the Bill should be fully considered. If we can get Amendments which may make this Bill more in accordance with what I think is desirable it should be, I should be only too glad. Let me say at once that my own view is that the best solution of this matter would have been to put off this Bill for this session and to have had a full discussion between all those interested in the matter, when I think a much better Bill than this would have been arrived at. I am not making this merely as an excuse. I have considered the matter and have talked with others about it. Considerable objections have been raised to the details of the Bill, and I believe that if the County Councils Association, after having got complete information from all the county councils, had had the opportunity of discussing with the promoters the details of this Bill, and especially those with regard to the finances and the scale of pensions, we might have arrived at a solution acceptable to all, and which would have caused little difference of opinion. Of course, in this matter I am entirely in the hand of the House. So far as I am concerned I have ventured to lay these considerations before you. I hope, at all events, whether the Bill is proceeded with this session to the end or whether it is not, that in Committee we may get some improvement made in the Bill,
<col>1182</col>
but I shall retain full liberty with regard to any action I may choose to take on Third Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03557"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only wish to say a few words on the general principle of the Bill, and I am particularly anxious to do so after the interesting and weighty criticisms which have fallen from the noble Lord whose views are always entitled to well-deserved consideration in your Lordships' House, especially when what he says is in connection with county council matters, of which this is one. But, my Lords, I should like for a moment to go away from his detailed criticisms and remind your Lordships of the largeness of this question having regard to its ultimate importance. When one looks into it it really turns out to have much bigger results than lie upon the surface. In the first place it is of the highest possible importance to the, I am sorry to say, increasing number of unfortunate patients of whom we are thinking, that those who are attending upon them should be the best possible people that can be got for that particular kind of work. We are at this moment losing the assurance that we are getting the best available material for the purpose, and we are therefore desirous of taking every step that will result in such material being obtained for the carrying out of a work which is one of quite extraordinary difficulty, responsibility, and anxiety. I do not 'know how many of your Lordships have read the Report of the Select Committee which inquired into this matter and the evidence which is appended to it, but those of your Lordships who have done so&#x2014;and I think I have gone through every word of it&#x2014;will realise, I am certain, not merely the need of something of this kind, but the extraordinary unanimity with which the principles embodied in this Bill have been accepted. That the principle is indisputably a right one can hardly be doubted by anybody who reads the Report and the evidence appended to it. I confess to a little surprise when listening to some of the criticisms of my noble friend who has just sat down. He says that the Bill passed through the House of Commons on Second Reading, went to a Select Committee, came back from the Select Committee, and on Third Reading was not opposed. That argument hardly goes to show that there was a great deal of opposition to it. If closure had been
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0598"/>
<col>1183</col>
applied it might have been a different thing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03558"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: I am unwilling to interrupt, but my argument was that as there was no discussion with regard to the principle on Second Reading it ought at all events to be discussed in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03559"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: If there were any objections to the principle on Second Reading there was every opportunity in the House of Commons for objections to be raised. The Home Office consented to the Bill being read a second time on condition that it went to a Select Committee, and when it was sent to the Select Committee the county councils were communicated with in order that they might bring forward any objections they had in the matter, and we have the result in the Blue-book. All the objections the county councils put forward are presumably in this Blue-book; at all events they had the opportunity of making objection if they desired to do so. I ask your Lordships, will any one read this evidence and say that the principle on which this Bill centres has been objected to by anybody? Not only the members of the Committee but all the witnesses were practically unanimous in asserting the principle embodied in the Bill. The noble Lord told us that there had been a mistake in the statistics quoted as to the formulated opinions of county councils sent in in the form of resolutions, but, after all, his argument reduced itself down to seven in favour as against three not in favour. All the county councils, however, had an opportunity of objecting if they so desired, and whether the statistics quoted were correct or not, the fact at all events remains that up to the present time there has not been, except in the smallest possible proportion, any objection taken to the principle of the Bill either by county councils as a whole or by the asylums committees of the county councils. However, my Lords, those are questions of detail as to the kind of opportunity that has been given for opposition to be brought forward. Until the noble Lord's speech to-night there has hardly been any criticism of the main principle of the Bill, although there have been criticisms as to the details, which are, I should have thought, capable of amendment in this House. For instance, whether it is true
<col>1184</col>
that a labourer employed by an asylum becomes under the Bill an established officer entitled to a pension I should have considerable doubt, but, if any mistake has been made, I imagine the thing is capable of amendment.<lb/>
But the main point of the noble Lord's opposition, as I understood it, was that the thing was more or less being hurried. That does seem to me of all phrases or epithets which could be used with regard to this subject the most inappropriate. Since 1891 this question has been familiar to all those who have had to do with asylum matters. We have the advantage at this moment of having present in the House two noble and learned Lords who have had under their control the Lunacy Commissioners and who can tell us the opinion which has been expressed by them for a very long time; and this House, on the motion of the noble and learned Lord who sits opposite, passed a Bill which virtually gave effect to the main principle which this Bill endeavours to reassert. Now, on the very eve of our attaining this long-desired object, are we to be told that we are to hang the matter up again and send it back for further consideration when every opportunity has been given for raising objections and those objections have not appeared? There has been, and we are all very thankful for it, a great improvement in recent years in the management of asylums in this country. That improvement has been due in part to the painstaking efforts of the leaders of medical and mental science who have dealt with this particular problem, but not less to the officers and the subordinate officers of the asylum who have to perform one of the most trying and unpleasant tasks that it is possible to imagine&#x2014;a task requiring that those who undertake it should be relieved from all the anxiety which we can relieve them of when their health has broken down and they have worn themselves out in the service. Through those officers we are dealing with a class of the community which beyond all question is the most helpless and the most unable to speak or act for itself&#x2014;namely, the patients in these great asylums; and we want, if we possibly can, to ensure that the very best material that is obtainable shall be at our service for this purpose.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to the evidence that came from the witness who appeared on behalf of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Mr. Crowther. May I read a few sentences
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0599"/>
<col>1185</col>
from that evidence? He says that in the West Riding there has been a rule for many years that any officer entering their service has to sign a paper that he or she waives any right to a pension on retirement. Then the witness tells us what has been the result of that rule. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"We believe that if there was a prospect of pension we should get a better class of applicant. Since 1891, when we abolished the system of giving pensions, we have not had the same quality of applicant. Our reason for saying so is that we have not really the same number now who take up the nursing and ambulance work for which we give certificates. We think that pensions would remedy that."</quote>
That shows, my Lords, that the people who now take up service in these institutions where there are no pensions given have not got their hearts in their work in the same way, and are not prepared to give their time to the technical work and instruction necessary to make them thoroughly capable, and the lack of which makes all the difference in the world to the unfortunate patients in the institutions. There is in regard to these public servants a difference, which is sometimes forgotten, between their position with respect to pensions and some of the other public servants we are more accustomed to deal with, and who are perhaps, engaged in what might be called kindred work. We have been reminded that the police, those who serve under the Poor Law, and those who serve in prisons are all entitled to pensions in the way that is here proposed; but we have not been reminded of one fact, which is this, that, unlike all those other officers, there is open to attendants in asylums a branch of service kindred to that in which they have been engaged&#x2014;that is to say, as attendants in private asylums or attendants upon private patients who are afflicted in their minds; and nothing is more dangerous than that we should lose from our public institutions experts in these matters who are prepared, because the positions are more lucrative, to transfer themselves to private institutions or to private control of patients, because we are not prepared to offer them those pensions which under similar service elsewhere they would be entitled to look forward to. I do feel that it would be a disaster of the first magnitude were we at this stage, after all that has been said in favour of this principle, to go back upon it on the ground that there are objections. I do not wish to criticise the degree of their gravity, but those objections at all events are not fundamental to the principle of this
<col>1186</col>
measure, and I trust your Lordships intend to read the Bill a second time to-night and let it pass into law during the present session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03560"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely there will be no question that your Lordships' House will read this Bill a second time. Here is a Bill sent up by the House of Commons without discussion because there was no opposition to it, and are we to insist upon an elaborate and protracted discussion of it by those who are apparently unanimous in holding one view with regard to it? I should be very sorry to suggest any such thing. Months ago the county councils apparently were invited to express an opinion by their own association with regard to the Bill, and three county councils alone objected to this burden being imposed upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03561"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: If the noble and learned Lord will excuse me, what I said was that the only answers received had been from seven county councils in favour and three against. I based no argument upon it with regard to the numerical strength of each party; it was only a piece of information which I felt bound to lay before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03562"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I was not putting my proposition adversely to the noble Lord, because I do not think that he really has expressed himself with hostility towards the Bill. I was not intending to use it as an <i>argumentum ad hominem,</i> but out of all the county councils the fact remains that only three of them objected to the passing of the measure. I have intervened to address your Lordships because, as you are aware, connected with the office I hold I have a great deal of responsibility in regard to this most unhappy class of His Majesty's subjects. The noble and learned Lord who preceded me on the Woolsack will, I am sure, tell your Lordships the same thing, that in respect of the work of the Lunacy Commissioners similar representations have been received over and over again. Lord Waldegrave, who is the Chairman of the Lunacy Commissioners, has shown me a letter of the 29th September last written by them in which they state that they had written a Memorandum to this effect, that the Commissioners were in entire agreement with the objects of the Bill and that there should be an obligation
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0600"/>
<col>1187</col>
upon asylum authorities to grant superannuation allowances on a fixed scale. The reason that these attendants are deserving of consideration is that the service upon which they are engaged is not only a dangerous one but is extraordinarily arduous and difficult; they have to incur the risk of personal injury and to submit to things which, if done by an occupant of a prison, would be punishable, and if by a patient in a hospital the necessary force to restrain could be used; but the attendants upon these unhappy people have to submit to these, things. One of the Commissioners himself, I know, has been injured, and it is not an uncommon thing for serious injury to be inflicted upon these attendants by their patients. Is it not right that these Unfortunate people should get their attendants from the best material that can be found, and that the attendants who run these risks should have some provision made for them in the way of pensions in the future, thus preventing them when they are still capable from leaving the public institutions for more lucrative employment in private institutions, or from being retained out of compassion after they have ceased to be able to discharge their duties? As regards the principle of the Bill, I do not understand that the noble Lord himself objected to the Second Reading, so that we need not leap before we come to the stile; and when we reach the next stage the criticisms of the noble Lord, which are valuable as regards detail will be deserving of serious consideration. As the noble Lord did not object to the Second Reading, I trust your Lordships will accord it, because I feel that the general principles of the Bill are sound and necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03563"><member>VISCOUNT CROSS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having been chairman of the visiting committee of one of these asylums and knowing perfectly well the dangers to which the officers as well as other people are exposed, I would ask your Lordships to read this Bill a second time without further comment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03564"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel I ought not to be silent in this discussion because my silence might be misconstrued. I heartily support the Second Reading of this Bill and I think it would be a great misfortune if the opportunity, which is not very easily obtained, of passing such a Bill as this is neglected because of the sort of vague general idea that my noble friend
<col>1188</col>
behind me has suggested that a better Bill will be brought forward at some time or another. I have heard that aspiration expressed before on many occasions, but I am afraid I do not remember it ever being fulfilled. I have not read the Report of the Select Committee to which the most rev. Primate referred, and I do a little protest in this House against the course pursued by my noble friend behind me. I do not know that it is part of our duty to acquaint ourselves with the discussions in the other House&#x2014;in fact, it seems to have been forgotten that a discussion of what hon. members have said there is not quite in order in your Lordships' House. But whether that is in order or not it is extremely inconvenient to discuss, and with some degree of criticism, those who gave evidence before a Select Committee of the House of Commons. This is the opportunity to discuss the matter if it is to be discussed, and we are not to be precluded from the exercise of our functions by what has been said on the subject on either side in the House of Commons. The question here is that this Bill is now proposed for Second Reading, and if there is any objection to the principle of it this is the opportunity for making it. I confess I was a little surprised to hear so old and respected a Member of this House mentioning more than once that the thing ought to be brought forward again, and that this and that objection made by county councils ought to be considered. Be it so, but this is the opportunity of doing it, and I have not heard any objection raised. What may be said or considered when it is a question of whether this or that section shall stand part of the Bill is another thing, and will have to be considered when the Bill is put forward in Committee.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, let me say a word about the principle of the Bill. I had to consider the principle on another occasion in connection with the Bill to which the most rev. Primate referred, and I must say if there ever was a class of person who in the interests of the public ought to have pensions I think these attendants in lunatic asylums form such a class. It is their duty very often to submit to violence and cruelty, and as long as human nature remains what it is it requires an extraordinary degree of temper and coolness to receive the injuries that they sometimes do and not to be able, as is the natural impulse of every man who receives a blow, to retaliate. Attendants in lunatic asylums,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0601"/>
<col>1189</col>
however, are obliged to submit to them in silence, and to behave with kindness and tenderness to those at whose hands they suffer. I do not believe that there is any other class of the community who undergo so much provocation as these attendants do, and who undergo it as a rule so admirably and with such good temper and good feeling. The principle of the Bill is to provide them compulsorily with pensions, and I should be very sorry indeed if the matter were to be left to the determination of those who, as my noble friend behind me says, have to provide the money, because sometimes there is a tendency to get the best men you can for as little as possible, and I think it is not desirable to leave it to them to say whether or not these persons are of a class entitled to a pension. For those reasons I hope your Lordships will read the Bill a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03565"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as this Bill extends to Ireland and as I have taken great interest in this subject and paid many visits to lunatic asylums and seen the unfortunate people confined there and those who administer to them, I would like to say a word with regard to it. No one respects the noble Lord, Lord Belper, more than I do, but I do not think that one word of his criticism touched the principle of the Bill. He discussed some details which will receive attention in Committee. But the principle of the measure is, Are those concerned with the administration and care of kinetics entitled to be regarded as this Bill seeks to regard them? I know of no class of public servants who have to administer a more difficult or more arduous task or under more trying conditions than this particular class. Their work entails upon them not only a mental but an enormous physical strain, and it is no wonder that many a man and many a woman break down under it; and I conceive that they are a class who are entitled to special consideration at the hands of those who attend to the legislation of the country. The way in which it is sought to be carried out may be open to question, but that the class of public servant with which the Bill deals is entitled to every conceivable consideration I do not think is open to question. I do not understand the points that were made about the passing of the Bill through the House of Commons. It passed through the House of Commons unopposed because it met with general approval, and I have no doubt that your Lordships will support the Second Reading. I have not
<col>1190</col>
heard a single syllable to prevent any one from giving a Second Reading to the Bill, and the suggestion that we should post pone the debate to another session is, if I may say so, in my opinion a very idle one. We have lots of time now to discuss it; if there are any objections we can meet them and answer them; but as we have the Bill before us now I hope we will give it a Second Reading, and at a later stage pass it through Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03566"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I My Lords, I should like to say one or two words with regard to what I believe to be the attitude of those county councils who have expressed their appreciation of the Bill. I think they are at one with your Lordships in considering that those who spend a very large portion of their <ob/>ives in contact with lunatics are entitled to be rewarded with a pension when the period of their service has expired, and the county councils are in favour of the granting of pensions being made compulsory. I think that is the attitude of most of the county councils, and that their approval of the certainly goes that far. But that approval should not, I think, be carried too far, because I am not certain that it goes beyond Clause 12 of the Bill, which says that an established officer or servant means such officer or servant as the local authority may determine to be engaged in the work or administration of the asylum. I do not think that the approval of the county council goes so far as to say that every person who is employed permanently in the work of conducting an asylum is necessarily a person who ought to receive a pension, and if there is any doubt about that in regard to Clause 12 it certainly ought to be set right. There is another point which I do not think ought to be taken on behalf of the county councils as being included in their assent to the principle of the Bill, and that is the question of the scale. There is, I fancy, in the minds of many no reason why there should be a difference between the period of age when the servant may demand to retire with the pension and the period when the asylum authority may retire them compulsorily on that pension. The amount of the scale, too, is a point which I do not think was included in the expression of approval which the asylum authorities have given and which the county councils have generally endorsed, and their approval should not be taken to go further than that they do think that those who are engaged in
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0602"/>
<col>1191</col>
active service in the lunatic asylums and are brought into constant contact with lunatics should have an assured and certain pension on a fixed and, if possible, uniform scale. To that extent, my Lords, I think that the majority of the county councils may be said to approve the principle of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03567"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as this Bill refers to Ireland, and as I have some slight experience of the management of lunatic asylums and other local bodies I should like to say a few words. I think that the uniform rate of pension provided for in this Bill is a most valuable one, and is in itself quite a sufficient reason for supporting the Bill on Second Reading. Any points of detail can be settled in Committee. The reason I advocate a uniform rate of pension is this. The noble Lord who introduced the Bill mentioned two cases where pensions had been allotted in a remarkably unjust and unequal manner. Of course those were exceptional cases, and would not be likely to occur in the ordinary course of things; but it does seem to me that, as the noble Lord also said, the way in which pensions may be granted depends very much on whether the managing body of the asylum happens to be in a generous or a niggardly frame of mind at the moment. I would also point out that the management of one asylum may be habitually in a more generous frame of mind than another, and there is further the point that unfortunately differences of opinion on matters wholly unconnected with the management of asylums, such as religion and politics, do prevail in Ireland a good deal, and there is a danger that these differences of opinion might be introduced into the discussion of the respective merits of retiring officers. I think it is most expedient, therefore, that there should be a uniform rate. I have heard the argument used&#x2014;not at a meeting of an asylum committee it is fair to say, but at a board of guardians&#x2014;that unless a man is absolutely destitute there is no occasion to give him a pension. It has been said, "If this man was a very poor man we might give him a pension, but he is fairly well off and there is no occasion to burden the ratepayer by granting him a pension," utterly forgetting the valuable services the man had rendered and the hard work he had done very often for an inadequate remuneration, and as there would be in this case the addition of the absolute dangers and difficulties with which officers of asylums have to
<col>1192</col>
contend I hope the Bill will be accepted for Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03574">[The EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03575">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03576">1.&#x2014;(1) The Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland (in this Act referred to as "the Department") may, with the consent of the council of any county, make an. order declaring that throughout the county alt plants of any species to which this section applies-are noxious weeds for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03577">(2) The species of plants to which this section applies are ragwort, charlock, coltsfoot, thistle, and dock, and the order may include all or any of those species.</p>

He explained that his Amendment would slightly limit the power of the county council with regard to the Bill. Subsection (4) of the clause as it stood authorised the county council themselves to revoke or alter any order made under the section, but on consideration it was thought better that they should not possess that particular power, and his Amendment carried out that intention.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03585"><b>2.</b>&#x2014;(1) Where the Department are satisfied that there are noxious weeds growing upon any land, they may serve upon the occupier of the land a notice in writing requiring him to cut down or destroy those weeds in the manner and within the time specified in the notice.</p>

He said that the Amendment was not put down an any spirit of hostility to the Bill. Part II, which dealt with agricultural seeds, met with their universal support, and Part I could be made both useful and necessary if guarded by the insertion of some reasonable safeguards. Their Lordships were well aware that thistles, for example, would make a second growth in August or September although they had been cut down at the proper season of the year, but that second growth was neither dangerous nor noxious with regard to adjoining land, and he was of opinion that men who had shown their <i>bona fides</i> and their desire to carry out the spirit of the Bill should not be liable to prosecution because of a second growth in cases where they had already cut down their weeds in the same year. Their Lordships were also aware that in certain parts of Ireland itinerant inspectors and reporters could gain cheap notoriety by instigating and recommending prosecutions against men engaged in great grazing industries on a large scale, and he thought where men had shown their <i>bona fides</i> and had once cut down their weeds they should not be laid open to being brought before petty sessions perhaps

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03589"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Whether the Amendment moved by my noble friend is the most appropriate one that can be devised I will not undertake to say, but it does seem to me that he is right in calling attention to this clause and in suggesting that there should be some safeguards as to the manner in which it might be applied. The clause is a very remarkable and extraordinary one, and I do not know whether the House has given attention to it. May I point out what will happen under this clause? The first step is for the Department of Agriculture, with the consent of the county council, to declare that a certain plant or plants is or are noxious weeds. Suppose the Department declares the first weed mentioned in the list, which is ragwort, to be a noxious weed. The next thing that happens is for the inspectors of the Department to start on an official tour in search of ragwort. From my slight knowledge of the country I will undertake to say that their quest will be a very successful one, and that they will find that particular botanical specimen almost universally luxuriant. The inspector, being armed with compulsory powers, may enter upon the land everywhere. There are possibly some places where he might not be received with open arms, but I pass that by. Then the inspector having reported that he has discovered an abundance of ragwort, the Department serves notices upon all the farmers who have been growing it, and I can imagine a shower of notices of the most portentous dimensions resulting all over the country. The recipients of these notices will thereupon have to commence the task of extermination and will have to neglect all other branches of industry, agricultural and political, and concentrate themselves for the time upon the extinction of ragwort. Supposing, which is far from unlikely, that these poor people find a good deal of difficulty in effectually getting rid of this particular herb, they thereupon, all of them, become liable to be hauled before

<col>1195</col>
the magistrates and to be fined, on a summary conviction, not more than &#x00A3;5 for the first offence and not more than &#x00A3;10 for a subsequent one. My Lords, it is to my mind absolutely inconceivable that this machinery should be applied indiscriminately and generally all over the country, and I think there will be a very great risk, as my noble friend has pointed out, of its being applied against individuals, and as often as not for a particular purpose. In my opinion, therefore, it is most necessary that somewhere in the Bill there should be words protecting those who have at any rate made a reasonable effort to get rid of these excrescences upon their fields against vexatious proceedings under the Bill. As the clause at present stands, it seems to me to lend itself to vexatious proceedings instigated from personal motives, and I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill will consider the suggestion of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03590"><member>LORD DENMAN</member> said he was glad to hear that the noble Lord had moved his Amend meat in no spirit of hostility to the Bill; but he did not know whether the noble Lord quite realised what effect it would have on Part I of the Bill. The noble Lord seemed to fear that certain persons would be liable to prosecution by inspectors and other people for more or less political or other motives. He would like to point out to the noble Lord that the inspectors under the Department of Agriculture in Ireland would have to deal with the administration of that part of the Bill, and so far as he was aware the Department of Agriculture in Ireland had not hitherto been accused of sending inspectors down to take vexatious proceedings against individuals for really unworthy purposes. He did not think the noble Marquess would himself support that contention for a moment. He thought that disposed of any danger of vexatious proceedings under the Bill. But further he would point out that any fines which might be imposed would go to the Department of Agriculture, so that local authorities would be under no temptation on that account to undertake proceedings against individuals. In order to secure a conviction under the Bill it would first of all be necessary to prove that noxious weeds were growing upon the land occupied by the person against whom the proceedings were taken, and, secondly, that although the Department had served a notice upon him calling upon him to cut
<col>1196</col>
down the weeds he had failed to do so. If the Amendment of the noble Lord was accepted it would have this effect, that it would be a good defence for a person against whom proceedings were instituted to say he had been in the habit of having his weeds cut down each year, and then he would not be liable to a penalty at all. But the trouble would be there just the same. The cutting down of weeds once a year would not prevent weeds being disseminated and causing injury to other lands in the vicinity. Of course, the fact that there had been attempts made to meet the provisions of the Bill would no doubt tend to mitigate the penalty imposed, but the Amendment as it stood would enable any unscrupulous person to make out a very plausible case and so evade the Bill altogether. So far as he understood, the small holders had raised no objection whatever to the Bill. He did, therefore, hope that noble Lords from Ireland, who might be taken perhaps to represent the larger owners or occupiers of land, would not insist upon such a very damaging Amendment as the particular Amendment moved by Lord Cloncurry. If the noble Lord's Amendment was accepted it would almost altogether destroy Part I of the Bill, and it would then become a question for the Department of Agriculture in Ireland to consider whether it was worth while proceeding further with the measure. A Bill of the kind necessarily must contain some rather drastic provisions, and it could only be by general agreement that such a measure could pass into law, but he would like to remind the noble Lord that it had a most flattering reception from the House on Second Reading, and that noble Lords connected with Scotland and England found fault with the Government because it only applied to Ireland. He did not think he would be contradicted when he said that that was a most unusual thing to happen in the case of a Bill emanating from the Department which he had the honour of representing in their Lordships' House. Of course, they would be very glad to consider any limitations which the noble Marquess desired to place on the operations of the Bill, but he hoped the noble Lord would not press his Amendment, because it was one which they could not possibly accept.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03591"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I would like to explain that in anything I said I was very far indeed from casting
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0605"/>
<col>1197</col>
any imputation upon the Department of Agriculture, or in suggesting that there would be the slightest tendency on their part to exhibit a partisan spirit in these matters. I have the greatest respect for the Department, but it is not the Department with which we shall have to deal. We have to deal in this case with local travelling inspectors, many of them, I believe, of a comparatively humble class, who might very easily be set in motion by interested persons against particular individuals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03592"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> said that what appeared to him to be a good point in the Bill was the enactment that a penalty should be imposed upon any person, who, greatly to the injury of his neighbour, insisted on growing weeds rather than the crops which his land ought to bear, and so far he would be very glad to see such an enactment applicable in this country. He confessed he could not vote for the Amendment which his noble friend had just moved because it would be quite impossible, if weeds were to be thoroughly eradicated, to allow a person to escape a penalty by the mere fact that he had cut his weeds down early in the season, for the reason that some of those weeds might have seeded and there might be a fine second crop of weeds before the season was over. He quite agreed, therefore, with the noble Lord opposite that the Amendment would knock the bottom out of the Bill. But was it necessary to enforce the Act by inspectors from the Department of Agriculture? It would be quite impossible for those inspectors to make themselves acquainted with all the weeds in Ireland, and would it not be sufficient to enact a penalty and let offenders be prosecuted in the ordinary way by any one who was aggrieved?</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03593"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: If the risks which the noble Marquess fears have any foundation, I should have thought that to place an unfortunate farmer at the mercy of a common informer might be worse than to place him at the mercy of an inspector of the Board of Agriculture. Although I see what was in the mind of the noble Viscount who has just sat down, that it does seem difficult for inspectors to keep an eye on the growth of weeds all over Ireland, I certainly should have thought that the inspectors of the Board of
<col>1198</col>
Agriculture were not liable to be subjected to the particular kind of pressure of which, the noble Marquess seems to be afraid. They are not, I should have supposed, the sort of men who would be subject to local prejudices and local influences, even although they may be of a comparatively humble class, and on the whole I think it, will be safest to adhere to the plan proposed in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

Most of those to whom he had spoken on the subject thought that the measure was a little drastic, so perhaps the best thing would be to wait and see how it worked in Ireland before making any attempt to extend the area of its application.</p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03602"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> said there was no doubt that the weeds in Ireland were perfectly outrageous, and that there were a number of noxious weeds in addition to those mentioned in the Bill. As he believed their Lordships' House trusted the Department of Agriculture, which had great experience in the matter, he thought they ought to have power to declare other plants to be noxious weeds in certain localities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03603"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DUNBOYNE</member> agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Cloncurry, that the two sections were inconsistent. If they were not he really did not know what inconsistency meant. He could only say it was an example of the manner in which Irish Bills were usually drawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03604"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that there is really any difficulty on the point. It is quite true that a certain list of weeds is set out in Clause 1, and that power is given to the Department in Clause 9 to declare that other plants are noxious. But that is according to precedent. In the Poisons Act, for instance, you will find a schedule of poisons at the end of the Act, and you will also find a clause empowering, by an Order in Council, other substances to be added to that schedule. That, I think, supplies an analogy, although the procedure is not the same. As the noble Earl, Lord Mayo, said very truly, the question really is whether you are prepared to say that the Agricultural Department in Ireland will exercise a wise discretion in this matter and will not insert in the schedule of weeds plants which are not weeds but something else. I confess I do not quite understand what it is that the noble Lord, Lord Cloncurry, is afraid of. Is he afraid that plants which are of a serviceable character should be inserted in the weed schedule by the Department? I should have thought that very unlikely to happen. We have heard tobacco described as a noxious weed, but great things are hoped for tobacco-growing in Ireland, and it certainly is not likely to be so described by the Board of Agriculture. I really do not see any objection to the form of the Bill as it stands.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF<lb/> LAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03608"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> rose to call attention to the proceedings taken in different parts of the country for the compulsory acquisition of land under the Small Holdings and Allotments Acts, and to move to resolve, "That in the opinion of this House, it is not desirable to apply the provisions of these Acts to the acquisition of land for other purposes, without alteration and amendment."</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03609">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I think perhaps I owe some slight apology for taking up the time of the House upon this subject at a period of the session when your Lordships are exceptionally busy in dealing with Bills of great importance and of some magnitude brought from the other House of Parliament. But my apology must be that the subject of my Motion is closely connected with more than one measure now before your Lordships' House and with some that were passed in the last session of Parliament. In the Housing and Town Planning Bill your Lordships will find clauses very similar to those in the Small Holdings Acts providing for the taking of land otherwise than by agreement. Those clauses were also originally in a Bill which is now before your Lordships&#x2014;the Development Bill. They have since undergone considerable modification, but, at the same time, it is quite clear that His Majesty's Government are very much enamoured of this particular procedure for the acquisition of land otherwise than by agreement. I therefore think that the moment is not inopportune to ask your Lordships to consider how those clauses have worked in the Acts to which I have referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03610">Up to the passing of those Acts what was the recognised procedure? It was, first of all, that in one shape or another Parliament should authorise the taking of the land. It might have been by a private Bill, it might have been by a public general Act, or it might have been by a Provisional Order
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0607"/>
<col>1201</col>
promoted by a Government Department; but in every case in the first instance the sanction of Parliament was required for the acquisition of the particular piece of land Then the Act, which is well known to your Lordships, the Lands Clauses Act, was incorporated in each of those Acts of Parliament, and it was only under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act that land could be acquired otherwise than by agreement. Then came the proposal in the Small Holdings Bill put forward by the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture. Your Lordships agreed to that Bill, and you did so, I think, for two reasons. In the first place, on both sides of the House it was agreed that the extension of small holdings was extremely desirable in this country, and that no undue obstacles ought to be put in the way. In the second place, it was, I think, held in some quarters that the expense and the delay of the proceedings which I have just enumerated were considerable, and that where the subject-matter was not one of great extent or of great value the procedure ought, if possible, to be simplified, and therefore both sides agreed to the provisions embodied in the Small Holdings Act, I think rather with the idea that it would be desirable that we should see how they worked before we proceeded to apply those principles to other statutory measures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03611">One word, my Lords, on the subject of the acquisition of land by compulsion. I think the noble Marquess behind me who leads the Opposition exactly summed up the opinion on this side of the House with regard to the acquisition of land by compulsion. He said that compulsion by itself was not a wrong thing if you could carefully limit the objects to which it was to be applied and the manner in which it was to be exercised. With that, my Lords, I absolutely and entirely agree. Noble Lords opposite have, I think, sometimes been inclined to glory in the application of an epithet to the word compulsion. They have spoken of that blessed word 'compulsion,'" and although I quite agree that compulsion may be necessary sometimes, I think there is another blessed word, and a word which ought to be as closely married to compulsion as husband is to wife, and that is the word compensation." I do not think that under any circumstances a man's property should be taken from him by compulsion
<col>1202</col>
unless he is given full compensation for the loss of his property.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03612">Now what is the nature of the compensation which is given under the Small Holdings Act? In the first place when another Act, of which the noble Earl opposite was also the author, was under consideration by Parliament&#x2014;the Agricultural Holdings Act, described by the noble Earl opposite, with that hyperbolic flow of language which we know in this House, as the Tenants' Charter &#x2014;words were put into that Bill by His Majesty's Government that no compensation should be paid to an out-going tenant if he were displaced for reasons of "good estate management," and we were particularly told that the object of putting in those words was that it might be desirable to take the land for small holdings, and that that was good estate management and no compensation therefore ought to be payable. I do not pursue that further because that is a matter which has been generally accepted on both sides of the House, but where I do say hardship comes in is where part of a man's land is taken from him and no compensation is given him for severance. I think your Lordships will remember that when this matter was under consideration by the House a good deal was said upon this subject by my noble friends Viscount St. Aldwyn and Lord Clinton, who were very anxious that the compensation to be paid to the tenant should be assessed by an arbitrator rather than by a valuer. My noble friend Viscount St. Aldwyn, I am sorry to see, has left the House, but it will be, I think, within the recollection of the Elouse that he said at that time it was of great importance in the interests of the occupying tenant that compensation should be decided by an arbitrator rather than by a valuer; he said the whole work of a man's life might, so to speak, be put an end to by the operations of the schedule, and was it not right, he asked, that such a person should have, with regard to the damage by severance, the same protection in compensation that he would have if his landlord gave him notice to quit. A day or two ago I read in the newspaper what purported to be a quotation from a letter written by my noble friend opposite, the President of the Board of Agriculture. If he tells me that what I am going to quote was not said by him at any time I shall, of course, not trouble your Lordships with any further remarks about it, but this is what he is reported to have said&#x2014;

I have no recollection whatever of anything of the kind happening in your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03613"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Would the noble Earl tell me when and where I am supposed to have said this?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03614"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is supposed to have written it in a letter to Mr. Seddon, M.P. If the noble Lord tells me he did not write or say this at any time I shall have nothing more to say. There are two measures before Parliament now to provide that some compensation should be given where a portion of a man's land is taken away for the purpose of small holdings, both introduced by political friends of the noble Earl. I know quite well that if any provision were made for giving compensation out of the amount of money payable by a county council the result would be that the small holder would have to be charged more rent for his holding. But what I want to ask the noble Earl is, What has become of the Small Holdings Fund which was set apart for the purpose of paying the expenses of obtaining the land? It was to have been &#x00A3;100 000 a year. As far as I can see from the Return presented to Parliament something like &#x00A3;99 up to the end of 1908 is all that had been spent for these purposes out of the Small Holdings Fund; and I would venture to ask, in view of the really serious feeling which there is in the country, where tenants are being compulsorily evicted, whether the noble Earl could not see his way to add to the costs of acquiring land by county councils a sum of money for compensation to the evicted tenant&#x2014;I think "evicted" is not too strong a word to use&#x2014;out of the Small Holdings Fund, a very considerable one, and as far as we know, not drawn upon to any very great extent. That is the first objection which I have to the procedure under the Small Holdings Act&#x2014;that there is no compensation for severance in a case where land is taken away from a tenant compulsorily.<lb/>
The next objection I have is to the provision in the Act which makes it impossible to employ counsel, or to call expert witnesses, except with the consent of the
<col>1204</col>
Board of Agriculture, and I venture to think that a real hardship has arisen there also. There was a case in Carmarthenshire, with which the noble Earl probably is familiar, where a lady was not allowed, at her own expense mind you, to employ counsel. This is not a question of putting any expense upon the county council or any additional rent upon the small holder. It is simply this, that without the consent of the Board of Agriculture no person can employ counsel to show cause why his land should not be taken or why it should be taken at a particular value. I know the Board of Agriculture have refused to allow counsel to appear for county councils. That may be all very well, because as a rule, as your Lordships know, county councils have very efficient officers who are able to conduct the case for the county council; but I do submit that it is a great hardship where, as in this case, the unfortunate lady could only be represented by a young solicitor in the town who knew practically nothing of the intricacies of land valuation and of the acquisition of land compulsorily, and that she should not be allowed at her own expense to employ counsel to combat the arguments which were brought forward by the very expert persons who represented the County Council of Carmarthenshire. That case was put forward as a test case, and the county council announced that it would be taken as a precedent whichever way the case went. The result was that it went against the lady, and she had very unfair treatment. I am told the Board of Agriculture have never in any case allowed counsel to be employed, and I venture to think that that is a somewhat serious blot on the procedure under the Small Holdings Act.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the third and last objection which I entertain to these provisions, and that is to the provision which makes it impossible to appeal from an order of the Board of Agriculture to a Court of Law. Your Lordships will, of course, recollect that under Section 39 of the Act an order when confirmed by the Board shall become final and have effect as if enacted in the Act, and the confirmation by the Board shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of the Act have been complied with and that the order has been duly made and is within the powers of the Act. There were a number of safeguards and limitations put
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0609"/>
<col>1205</col>
into this Act. It was provided that no land which is part of a home farm, or which was woodland, or part of a park, or of an ancient monument of archeological interest, is to be taken for the purpose of small holdings compulsorily, and that due regard is to be given to the amount of land taken from any one owner or occupier. Supposing the Board of Agriculture disregards that&#x2014;of course, I do not say intentionally, because I do not suppose that the Department of which the noble Earl is the head, or any other Department of the Government, would intentionally contravene an Act of Parliament, but it may be, for example, that there would be great difference of opinion as to whether a particular piece of land was or was not part of a home farm. Your Lordships know how difficult it may be to define exactly what is a home farm. But if an order is made and confirmed by the Board of Agriculture, it is then impossible to appeal to a Court of Law to have it set aside. There was a case the other day of a person named Ringer, whose land was taken from him for the purpose of small holdings. I know nothing of the merits of the case, but the noble Earl sitting behind the President of the Board of Agriculture very likely knows all about it, and it may be that the letter and the spirit of the Act were observed. But, at any rate, he did not think so, so he did what most British subjects think is the inalienable right of a subject of the Crown&#x2014;he went to a Court of Law; and they told him that the jurisdiction of the Court was ousted because Section 39 said that the order of the Board of Agriculture was to have effect as if enacted in the Act. It is, therefore, impossible to obtain any redress in the ordinary Courts of Law, and I Venture to say to your Lordships that that is another great objection to the procedure under the Small Holdings Act.<lb/>
The noble Earl the other day, I thought with some rather unnecessary warmth, when the noble and learned Lord behind me, the Lord Chief Justice, said he had heard that there had been some cases of injustice under the Act, stated that he was quite prepared to show that there never had been any case of injustice, and he challenged inquiry. I hope he will be able to convince your Lordships that there never has been any case of injustice, but the information which reaches me
<col>1206</col>
does not confirm that statement of the noble Earl. I believe that there have been and that there will be more cases of injustice if this procedure is embodied in future Acts of Parliament; and it is because your Lordships are being asked just now to consider proposals very similar to these in other measures that I have ventured to bring the subject before you and to move your Lordships to agree that it is not desirable that this particular procedure should be embodied in future. Acts of Parliament unless it be altered and amended so as to remove what I think is the legitimate grievance that has been shown to exist under the Act as it stands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03615">Moved to resolve, That in the opinion of this House, it is not desirable to apply the provisions of the Small Holdings and Allotments Acts to the acquisition of land for other purposes than small holdings and allotments without alteration and amendment.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Onslow.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03616"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Earl replies I should like to say one word by way of addition to what the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, has said on the question of valuation and arbitration with regard to dispossessed holders under the Act. As the Small Holdings Act was brought in it provided that in the case of a tenant who was compulsorily turned out the tenant should receive compensation for unexhausted improvements on a valuation by a valuer appointed by the Board. We accordingly inserted in the Bill an Amendment to the effect that he should be compensated by arbitrators, the arbitrators to be appointed by the parties, and, failing agreement, by the Board. That is the system which has always been adopted under the Agricultural Holdings Acts and is a fair and proper system. It is certain that under such a system a tenant farmer will get his rights, but under the Small Holdings Act when a tenant farmer was turned out of his land it originally took away from him the right of arbitration and made him submit to a valuation not by a valuer or arbitrator mutually appointed, but by a valuer appointed by the Board. When the Bill left your Lordships' House our Amendment giving him the full right of arbitration was cut out in another place, and when it came back to your Lordships, after a considerable amount of argument, there were put in three or four lines providing that the tenant should obtain the arbitration to
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0610"/>
<col>1207</col>
which he was entitled. That was granted to us but it was granted somewhat in the form of a concession to make up for the full right of arbitration which we had asked for and which we could not get. Yet, my Lords, it was not a concession in any way at all; if was merely conferring upon a tenant the right which was his and which always has been his, and it was in fact nothing more than a tardy recognition of what all along had been granted to a tenant under previous Acts of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03617"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly have no reason to complain of the speech of the noble Earl opposite, and I take it, after the speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition last night, and after the decision at which the House arrived last night, that we are all of us, or at any rate most of us I think I may fairly say, in favour of the compulsory acquisition of land under fair and proper conditions. I do not understand from the speech of my noble friend that he in any way objects to that principle. What I understand him to say is that he objects to seeing the methods and the machinery of the Small Holdings Act extended. I might ask just for one moment what are the alternatives as regards authority to acquire land compulsorily? As far as I know there are two&#x2014;there is the Provisional Order confirmed by Parliament, and there is the limited procedure under the Port of London Bill. I shall, of course, be glad to be corrected if I am wrong, but I am aware of no other machinery of any sort description, or kind, and as the noble Earl opposite moves that in the opinion of this House it is not desirable to apply the provisions of the Small Holdings and Allotments Acts to the acquisition of land for other purposes, without alteration and amendment, I therefore think I may fairly assume that he is in his heart of hearts in favour of the adoption of one or other of these two courses.<lb/>
I am bound to say at once that if the noble Earl had had his way as regards the Small Holdings Act, that Bill for all practical purposes would have been killed at once, because if the Act was to work in any way satisfactorily there was an absolute necessity to have a machinery which was simple and speedy and as little expensive as possible. The result, I think, has shown that your Lordships were quite right in agreeing to the provisions of the Small Holdings Bill,
<col>1208</col>
because in England and Wales during the last fifteen or sixteen months only 8,000 acres have been taken by compulsion out of a total of 57,772 acres taken altogether. On the Motion of the noble Earl I should like to be allowed to ask two questions, and two questions only. The first question is, Has the machinery of the Small Holdings Act been carried out fairly and impartially on the whole by the Board over which I have the honour to preside? Secondly, has it saved unnecessary expense? Has it saved an expense which, had that expense been insisted on, would most inevitably have knocked the Bill on the head for good and all? Lord Onslow seems to doubt whether the Bill has worked as well as I hope and really believe it has, but I am rather reassured by the speech which the noble Earl has made to-night because he really has brought no charges, as far as I understand, of injustice or of hardship against me this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03618"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: I have not suggested that the noble Earl was guilty of any act of injustice. I only said that the procedure provided in the Act might produce injustice. I must beg the noble Earl's pardon for interrupting him, but that was very far from suggesting that he personally had been guilty of any injustice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03619"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged for the interruption, and I quite agree with the noble Earl that it might have arisen, but it has not. Many things might be, but they are not; and I think it is a little bit hard to be brought up at the bar of justice and to be told that a great many things might happen which apparently have not. Still I am bound to say that the noble Earl has had a backing of a very important description. I should like to call the attention of your Lordships' House for one moment to a remark that was made by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice on a recent occas on, I think on the 4th of October when he told us that the injustice which had been caused under the Small Holdings Act in cases before the Courts would not have occurred had the man had proper representation. By proper representation I believe he means learned counsel. I would very respectfully ask to what cases does the Lord Chief Justice refer. The only case, so far as I am aware, that has been brought before the Court was the case alluded to by the noble Earl&#x2014;the case of Ringer <i>v</i>. the Norfolk County Council. I need not go into that case because the noble
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0611"/>
<col>1209</col>
Earl did not definitely say that there was any case of injustice, but if your Lordships want to know anything about that case my noble friend behind me, who is on the Norfolk County Council, will be able to give chapter and verse about the case of Ringer v. the Norfolk County Council, which was brought before Mr. Justice Darling and Mr. Justice Jelf in July of this year. It was an <i>ex parte</i> application, the Norfolk County Council not being represented, so that the two Judges, having heard only one side, naturally could express no opinion as to whether justice had or had not been done. They simply stated, what everybody knew, that under the Act they had no jurisdiction whatever. In addition, Mr. Ringer, who in the public Press has been held up as a martyr under this monstrous Act and as most grievously and shamefully ill-treated, never even applied to have what the Lord Chief Justice called proper representation. Like a wise man, he employed no counsel but kept his money in his pocket.<lb/>
I have here a sheaf of supposed cases of injustice, about which I have been soundly abused in the provincial Press. But I am happy to be able to say that I need not trouble your Lordships or detain you for a single minute on these supposed cases, as they have not been referred to in this House. There is one thing that I should like to be allowed to say. I object most strenuously to the word "injustice." It is a word that is often used with regard to proceedings under the Small Holdings Act. There is hardship perhaps&#x2014;I acknowledge that&#x2014;but it is not a hardship that is on one side only. No doubt the action sometimes taken is a hardship, or considered a hardship, by a farmer who has land all round a village, who has, one might say, the village by the throat. I know the case of a man who has 700 acres all round a village, up to the back-gardens. The landlord, as landlords are, is very anxious to give small holdings. He was asked, and lie said "I am afraid I cannot meet your wishes, because dear old John Barleycorn would object to it so seriously." No doubt it was a hardship for John Barleycorn, but what about the hardship for these labourers in those cottages, who, day after day and week after week, in their small wretched gardens at the back of their cottages, look hopelessly and hungrily over the hedge at these bits of land of which they are unable to get even so much as would fill a flower pot. There was one case which I brought before your
<col>1210</col>
Lordships&#x2014;the case of a village on the Crown Lands, where the farmers absolutely refused to give up any land to the men. They had great farms, and as they would not give up land I took it and gave it to the men. Mr. Armstrong, of Selby, complained bitterly that several farmers had had to give up twenty to thirty acres on farms of 800 to 1,000 acres in Yorkshire, and called it a great injustice and a most abominable act.<lb/>
I come to my second point. Has our procedure saved unnecessary expense? I do most respectfully claim that it has. For any procedure which allows expert witnesses and counsel and all the protection of the majesty of the law must inevitably be more costly than that which does not, and I honestly believe that the disallowance of these learned persons is one of the great merits of the Act. It leads to a considerable saving of expense, and, as I think we have seen to-night, no great injustice, I may say no injustice or hardship whatever, results, to the parties concerned. May I give one single instance of what I have done? I daresay many of your Lordships who live in the Eastern counties will remember the case of the St. Faith allotments. In 1891 the Norfolk County Council made a Provisional Order for the compulsory purchase of two fields or fourteen and a-half acres Their costs for the Provisional Order and. the consequent Parliamentary proceedings amounted to &#x00A3;499. The owner incurred. costs which were calculated at over &#x00A3;1,000, and the arbitrator awarded her &#x00A3;966 for the land. The two tenants dispossessed from these fourteen and a-half acres got, one &#x00A3;124 and the other &#x00A3;41. The expense of obtaining the land thus come to &#x00A3;24 per acre if you add to that ten per cent, for compulsory purchase, which was allowed in those days, you bring up the cost of the land for those poor men to &#x00A3;104 per acre. That naturally killed the Allotments Act of 1882 stone dead, and it quieted the ardour of landless men and also the ardour of the Norfolk County Council as well.<lb/>
I have only one more instance. You may say that it is ancient history; that it is the Old Testament and that it cannot happen now. But this happened in October, 1903&#x2014;six years ago. My trustees sold six acres to a girls' school, to a company of beneficent individuals who look after the education of girls. The price was to be fixed by an arbitrator, and the inquiry lasted two days. Expert wit-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0612"/>
<col>1211</col>
nesses, men of the highest possible standing, for the school put the highest price of this land of mine at &#x00A3;1,000. The arbitrator, after hearing counsel and expert witnesses for two days, and after three months interval, awarded me &#x00A3;3,425. The costs to my trustees amounted to &#x00A3;579, and I presume that the costs of the purchasers were not less, so that between us we paid in costs &#x00A3;1,159, or &#x00A3;159 more than the school expert witnesses swore, and I am perfectly certain honestly believed, to be the outside selling value of these six acres. Now that is not an extreme case. It is not a single case. These things are going on day by day and week by week. Of course I should be the last person to wish to push the question of expense too far. We all agree that justice is the first consideration. But I do say that though we may be enthusiastic in my office, we are all upright and honourable men, and our great and only object is to promote agricultural interests and to do justice between man and man. That is our ambition and that is our aim. I hope that in what I have said I have been able satisfactorily to answer the strictures of my noble friend the Chairman of Committees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03620"><member>THE EARL OF KIMBERLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been alluded to a great deal about a certain Ringer case, and I really think, if you will give me a few minutes indulgence, I can satisfactorily prove to your Lordships that in this case there was absolutely no injustice. There may have been slight hardship, but there must be hardship in some form. I will give you the bare facts of the case. In 1907 when the Small Holdings Act came into force there were a great many applications all over the county. On April 3 a farm was purchased by Mr. Ringer near the farm to which he and his brothers and sisters had succeeded and which they still hold jointly. His father had farmed the land for thirty-six years. He bought that farm at an absolute knock-out price of &#x00A3;16 10<i>s</i>. per acre, working out for 180 acres, with enfranchisements and copyhold, at &#x00A3;3,000. He knew there was a great demand in the parish where he lived for small holdings. On May 13, 1908, we proceeded, after a local inquiry, to get land under the Act, and on June 2, we made application to Mr. Ringer. He absolutely refused. His is the only land in the parish&#x2014;I challenge any-
<col>1212</col>
body to deny it&#x2014;that is really suitable for small holdings. The other land is not suitable. But he refused and the matter dropped for the time being, because we were so much engaged in hiring land voluntarily.<lb/>
On September 12, the Board of Agriculture sent down a complaint to us that small holdings had been required in the district and had not been got. We answered the letter, and on November 5 an inspector was sent down from the Board to visit the parish. The Board on November 16 suggested to us to consider the advisability of acquiring the farm. On January 2, 1909, the sub-committee again, after a long correspondence, and having tried in every way to induce Mr. Ringer to give up some of his land, reported that he refused absolutely to negotiate. On January 20 the sub-committee were still trying to do everything they could. On January 23 we got tired, and at last we said we would move for compulsory purchase. We gave notice for compulsory purchase, and on May 4 a commissioner was sent down to hold an inquiry. I may say that at that inquiry Mr. Ringer was represented by his own solicitor. On May 22 an order for compulsory purchase was confirmed. Mr. Ringer then sent in a claim for &#x00A3;6,327 for the purchase he had made only six months before at a cost of &#x00A3;3,000. He made the amount up in this way: 181 acres, &#x00A3;4,511; damage by severance, &#x00A3;1,099; alterations to farm, &#x00A3;25; money spent on the farm, &#x00A3;75; losses on implements, &#x00A3;150; disturbance as a tenant. &#x00A3;217; losses on covenants, &#x00A3;250. Naturally we were rather aghast. I would point out that the first item of &#x00A3;4,511 works out at &#x00A3;25 per acre for the land which he purchased at &#x00A3;16 10<i>s</i>. If we had purchased it at that it would have been all right, but he added all the other things.<lb/>
As we could not come to any terms we resolved, on September 1, to arbitrate. When that came on there was a local Chamber of Agriculture meeting at which a tremendous resolution was passed on account of the decision or rather of what was said in the Law Courts when the county council did not take the trouble to appear, because we thought we had no <i>locus standi.</i> The Act we thought covered us. The resolution stated that the Chamber, having considered the decision of the High Court of Justice and having the best wishes for
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0613"/>
<col>1213</col>
the success of small holdings and allotments was of opinion that the ouster of the jurisdiction of a Court of Law was undesirable and likely to have a prejudicial effect on the working of the Act. That resolution was passed by the Norfolk Chamber of Agriculture. They might have represented that when the Act was being passed, but they never thought about it then. They woke up, like Rip van Winkle, after a year and a-half and found this out.<lb/>
I moved, and very nearly carried at the next meeting, a resolution that we should proceed to arbitration at once, but it was suggested that if it were possible we should again meet Mr. Ringer. Two extra men of the sub-committee were then sent down, one of them one of the most able valuers and land agents in the county. They asked him if he had anything to say. He said he thought he would perhaps offer fifty-five acres, but he declined to do anything further. He said he must consult other people. The fact of it is he is a very much misguided young man, entirely in the hands of people who are trying to make him pull chestnuts out of the fire. He had two friends on the committee. The next time the committee met after that and I moved that we proceed, his two friends got up and said that he had not a leg to stand on and they could not therefore do otherwise than vote for my motion, which was carried unanimously. Our committee is a very mixed one. There are on it landlords, valuers, and the secretary of the labour union. We meet nearly every Saturday, and, for myself, I can say I have only missed two Saturdays for eighteen months There is a lot to do, but we have never had a word of disagreement. We may have argued, but we have always been unanimous, and we should not have done this if there had been the slightest injustice of any sort or kind. At the present moment Mr. Ringer is in the position that if the arbitrator says that the price is so heavy that we cannot let the land at a proper price to the applicants he will remain in undisturbed possession. I may say that land is going up in Norfolk. People are buying it in the hopes of getting the county council to pay for it. A man came to me recently and told me he had bought certain land and asked what the county council was going to give for it. I replied, "You can keep it." If you once give compensation like this you will have land
<col>1214</col>
snapped up all over the place in the hope of its being bought and compensation paid. There is not one atom of injustice, I repeat, in the case of Mr. Ringer. He bought the land knowing we were applying for it, and he might have come to us. If he had been a sensible young man, instead of being badly advised, he would have sold this land long ago and saved himself enormous delay and expense and put a very handsome sum into his pocket.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03621"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: If the speech to which we have just listened is the outcome of this form of annexing property, it furnishes in itself a very considerable argument against it. I see much that is unfair in what the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture thinks perfectly fair. Surely it is unfair that when a man thinks he has had an injustice done him by a public body, it should be possible for a member of that body to come and deliver his own view of the case without giving the other side the smallest opportunity of being heard. That is what we have witnessed to-night. We have been told that there is an individual who thinks that he was badly treated by the county council. He went to a court of law and was told that the court was not open to him. The case is mentioned here incidentally, quite incidentally, by the noble Earl who brings the Motion forward, and it has been made a peg upon which a long statement has been hung, reflecting very seriously upon this gentleman&#x2014;a statement, as I said before, to which he has no opportunity of replying. Now that could not have happened had this case been taken before a court of law. You do not hear in this House the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the matter, and it furnishes to my mind one of the strongest arguments against the provisions of this Act, that it leads to things of this sort. I am sorry, my Lords, to say that the President of the Board of Agriculture does not altogether approach the matter in a judicial spirit. He has tried to put a complexion and a colour upon the case by taking the instance of a man who occupied a farm all round a village. Is that the only case in which compulsory purchase powers have been put in force under this Act? The noble Lord knows that such instances are comparatively rare.</membercontribution></p>

Of course I am not saying there are not such cases, but to suppose that the grievance of compulsory purchase only occurs in a case of that sort is an entire misapprehension of what is going on. I do not wish to detain the House longer, but I could not help making a protest against what I think is most unfair to any person who considers an injustice has been done him, that his case should be argued here without the slightest opportunity being given to him to answer the charges. I know absolutely nothing about the case myself, and therefore I am most impartial on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03624"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps it would not be right that the debate should close without a few observations being delivered from this Bench. Let me say, to begin with, what has often been repeated from this side of your Lordships' House, that there is none of us who is opposed to the establishment of small holdings. On the contrary, we believe in small holdings, and most of us, in our private capacity, have done our best to promote them. But I confess that when I hear the noble Earl opposite, the President of the Board of Agriculture, speaking in rather scornful tones of the hardships inflicted upon sitting tenants by the operation of the Act, I regret such a tendency in his mind. The hardship is very great where a tenant of many years standing is turned out of his holding under the operation of the Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03625"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03626"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Just compare the attitude of mind in which each of us approaches the subject when we are dealing with tenants in our private capacity and when we are asked to deal with them by the noble Earl opposite as members of a county council. Everybody knows that on well-managed English estates the tenant who occupies land from year to year is as safe, as undisturbed, as if the land belonged to him, so long as he performs the covenants of his tenancy. From year to year the tenant remains on as his father had remained before him. Nobody dreams of disturbing him. That is the practice, I am glad to say, as between good landlords and good tenants
<col>1216</col>
over the length and breadth of England. Therefore to say there is no hardship in turning out a tenant is idle. There undoubtedly is. There may be in certain cases sufficient reason to overcome the consideration of that hardship, but that the hardship exists is undoubtedly the case; and I regret very much to hear from the noble Earl that as much as 8,000 acres has been taken compulsorily under the operation of the Act.<lb/>
I am quite sure the less compulsion there is in the working of the Act the better Every effort should be made, and I am quite certain that by the county council upon which I sit every effort has been made, to avoid compulsion and proceeding to last extremities. The Act has worked in many cases sufficiently well, and that has been due to the action of the county councils themselves, because the county councils in England&#x2014;at any rate I can speak for my part of the country&#x2014;are moderate in character and anxious to apply temperately any powers they possess. They do their utmost to prevent any hardship taking place. But what the Lord Chairman urged before your Lordships was that there were provisions in this Act which were capable of very unjust application, and I think in what he said he was abundantly justified. The two particular matters which he brought forward were these. First, that where persons come before the Court to recover the price which is due to them under the operation of the Act they should be allowed to be represented by counsel. The noble Earl opposite said he thought we were very well quit of these learned gentry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03627"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I did not use that term.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03628"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Earl called them learned. He is quite justified in that. He seemed. to think the whole paraphernalia of our Courts of Justice&#x2014;counsel, Judges and other forms&#x2014;unnecessary excrescences on our social system which we should be better without. My Lords, why do we take so much trouble to have these Courts of Justice? Why, after so many years of traditional experience, have we erected an elaborate code of rules under which they are administered? Why are counsel trained to plead before those Courts
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0615"/>
<col>1217</col>
under very careful rules? Why is all this done if justice could be achieved without it? Why are we put to the pains and expenses of having all this intricate system of justice? It is because it has been found by experience that you cannot rely upon getting justice unless you have these forms. These institutions are essential to the administration of justice and the securing of justice for the subjects of His Majesty. Therefore we on this side of the House have always protested against legislation, of which many examples have been produced by noble Lords opposite, which seeks to dispense with this protection.<lb/>
I do not want to trouble your Lordships by referring to the Bill which has recently occupied a great deal of your attention, but it will be within the recollection of your Lordships that it required the action of the Opposition in order to force upon the Government the provision of Courts of Justice under the Housing and Town Planning Bill which we have just passed. In Bill after Bill the Government have tried to dispense with this protection, and in Bill after Bill it has been our duty to insert it. I am sorry to say that in the Small Holdings Act we did not do so, and I think it will be found that the absence of this protection of the right of the subject to conic before a Court of Justice and be represented by trained counsel will tell against the equitable administration of the Small Holdings Act. I repeat what I ventured to say at the beginning of my remarks, that we are in favour of small holdings and that we hope the Act will succeed. But we regret the blemishes which; not by our action, but by the action of the Government, were left on that Act when it passed through Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03629"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I need only say one or two words in reply to what has fallen from the noble Duke and the noble Marquess who has just sat down. Alluding to compulsion and the possible hardship inflicted on the holder of a farm, the noble Marquess spoke very truly of the tradition of well-managed estates on which a yearly tenant is in a secure position. That is perfectly true. But there are exceptions which are liable to work far greater hardship to the tenant than anything which, as far as I know, has ever been done under the provisions of the Small Holdings Act. In the first place, a man may sell part
<col>1218</col>
of his property. Nobody can say that every landowner is bound to keep in every part of England every acre of land which he possesses. He may wish to add to one estate and reduce another. In that case his yearly tenant gets notice to quit, and whether he remains on his farm or not depends on the will of the purchaser. That is one case. There is another case which certainly happens on the best managed estates. The noble Marquess may go so far as to say no one ought to sell land, but nobody can say that a man ought not to develop his land, and there are oil the estates of a great many of your Lordships' cases in which parts of farms become available for building. Nobody thinks of the tenant then. He is compensated, as he ought to be, but I never heard of anybody who had such a sentiment for his tenant in the capacity of a farmer that he refrained from building on land that had become ripe for that purpose. In this case the affliction of the tenant appears to me exactly of the same character as if part of his land were taken for small holdings, with this undoubted difference, that the tenant is very often a man who quite recognises that the landlord is doing a sensible thing in turning part of his farm into building land. He is, however, not likely to be much of a believer in the system of small holdings, and he would think it a hardship that any land should be taken away in support of a scheme in which he did not believe. That is practically the difference which makes the farmer complain more in the one case than in the other. The noble Marquess said it was a hardship for a man to have all his farm taken away.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03630"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It is very often a much greater hardship to have half his farm taken away.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03631"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I agree that is so. But among these eight thousand acres, of the taking of which I have no personal knowledge at all, I wonder if it will be found that there are cases in which the whole of a man's farm has been taken and he has been thrown on the world without any other farm to go to, or whether there are case of the kind mentioned by the noble Marquess in which the tenant of a farm up to 300 acres has had a half taken away. I very much doubt if such a case exists. My impression is that in cases of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0616"/>
<col>1219</col>
compulsory purchase as a rule moderate slices have been taken off large holdings. My noble friend behind me knows more about it than I do, but I shall be surprised if the particular cases of hardship mentioned as possible are likely to have occurred.<lb/>
With regard to the criticism raised by the noble Duke upon the speech made by my noble friend behind me, Lord Kimberley, I quite appreciated the reticence with which the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, mentioned the case of Mr. Ringer. But if he will forgive my saying so, it might have been better if in the circumstances, when he was not prepared to describe the case, he had not mentioned the name at all. It would have been less likely to lead to some further mention of the case by my noble friend behind me. I cannot, however, think that any possible harm could be done to the gentleman in question by the speech which my noble friend made, because, as I understood it, the case was now in this situation, that it was merely a question of how much an arbitrator would say the land was worth, and in that respect I cannot see that the gentleman's interests would in any way be damaged by what my noble friend behind me said.<lb/>
On the general question I only have to say this. The noble Marquess talked about the experience and the tradition of ages; those hoary traditions which have, no doubt, come down to us from our forefathers. But if you look at this in a practical and commonsense way you will see that you cannot have it both ways. You cannot surround every one of those transactions with all that tremendous apparatus of legal inquiry which the noble Marquess thinks is necessary. It is all very well to say you are in favour of small holdings. It is an abstract opinion which anybody can hold, but if, as we believe to be the case, you have to choose between the provision of small holdings on the one hand and on the complete maintenance of all this expensive apparatus of legal inquiry on the other, you must make your choice. I do not see how it can be denied that if you permit the employment of highly paid expert witnesses and expensive counsel you either prevent the transactions taking place in many cases at all or you give an advantage to the long purse over the short one; and when the noble Marquess talked of those venerable traditions, which we all respect,
<col>1220</col>
we must recollect that is not only a matter of veneration but it is also to the interest of a large number of people to maintain them. We have seen that in relation to a subject of which we have often heard from the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury&#x2014;namely, the question of the transfer of land. The noble and learned Earl has often spoken in this House within my recollection of the dead weight of interests which prevent the cheapening of the transfer of land in this country, and it is something of the same kind, in addition to the reverence which we all feel for the high traditions of British law&#x2014;it is something also of the kind which tends to make a large number of people regard it as necessary to employ in all cases expert witnesses and counsel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03632"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is putting&#x2014;perhaps through my own fault&#x2014;much more upon me than I think I intended to say. The argument the noble Earl is addressing to the House is in favour of cheapening procedure but not of abolishing legal protection altogether. That is the charge which the Government have to meet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03633"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: You cannot, I. think, enjoy the one without running the risk of the other. I certainly did understand the noble Marquess was speaking of expert witnesses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03634"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Counsel is what I said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03635"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is also true, if you are to carry all these cases to the High Court, that it involves the employment of counsel and possibly a large expenditure of money. I have nothing to add, but I do feel very strongly that if you are to have this cheaper procedure you may, in fact you must, have to give up something. I suppose everybody would like to have his case tried before the pick of the Judges of the High Court and also to be able to employ the most able counsel; but hundreds and thousands of cases of all kinds are tried before Courts all over the country under far less imposing circumstances and yet very substantial justice is done. I hope, therefore, that so far as regards the procedure under this Act, it being apparently
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0617"/>
<col>1221</col>
impossible to lay down any rule by which you can keep applications to a Court on a thoroughly cheap footing, you will be content, in the absence of proved cases of hardship, to rely on the procedure under the Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03636"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: May I venture to say that I think the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture has not perhaps done me the complete justice of reading the Notice of Motion which I put upon the Paper of your Lordships' House. I think the noble Earl came down with a sort of idea that I was going to make a general attack upon the way in which the Small Holdings Act had been administered by the Department over which he presides. I had the honour of being President of the Board of Agriculture, and I know something of the officials of the noble Earl's Department, though, of course, the Commissioners under this Act are men who have been appointed under the noble Earl and with whom I am not acquainted. But the noble Earl asked the question, "Did they or did they not on the whole carry out the Act impartially?" I hope there was nothing I said in the remarks I addressed to your Lordships to suggest that there was any desire on the part of the noble Earl or his officials to carry out this Act in any way except with impartiality. What I did say was that the procedure which had been put into the hands of the noble Earl by Parliament was such that it might occasionally work injustice in particular cases; and I ventured to put before your Lordships instances where, whether it was so or not, it was thought by the persons who considered themselves aggrieved that injustice had been worked. I did not go into the case of the Norfolk County Council which has been referred to because I am not at all familiar with the circumstances, and I was quite certain that your Lordships' House was not the place in which the question could be argued upon one side or upon the other. If I did wrong in mentioning that case I offer my apology to the noble Earl the Leader of the House. All I can is that as this is the only case in which application has been made to the Courts it would be quite obvious to what case I alluded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03637"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl will understand I made no complaint of what he did.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1222</col>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03638"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: The gist of all my observations was not whether in this particular case the man got the compensation he ought to have got but whether the order of the Board of Agriculture did or did not contravene the Act of Parliament. That, I understand, was the question which this gentleman desired to put to the Court. That was my point. I did not go into the question whether the man got the proper amount or not, but whether the Act had been infringed, for when he went to the Court to ask he was told that they had no power to exercise any jurisdiction. Then the noble Earl said, Have we or have we not carried out these compulsory purchases without unnecessary expense? What I said was that if the alterations which I suggest ought to be made in this procedure were carried into effect it would not add to the expense in any material degree. The Leader of the House talked a great deal about the panoply of justice and the cost of having cases tried before the most eminent Judge or by the most distinguished counsel. That is not what I put forward at all, if I may venture to say so. What I put forward was that where there is a doubt whether the Act has been properly carried out by the Department there should be some opportunity of appealing from the public Department. There is none such in the Small Holdings Act. It is exactly the procedure which was proposed to your Lordships the other day in the Housing Bill, and it is for that reason I thought it my duty to call your Lordships' attention to it.<lb/>
The noble Earl said very little with regard to the question of compensation. On former occasions the noble Earl has said he was very anxious to do all he could to give compensation where he thought there was any hardship. There was a case&#x2014;I am almost afraid to mention names, but it is a well known case&#x2014;the Clarke case, the case of a tenant of the Crown. The last time that case was referred to in this House the noble Earl said that he would take into his most earliest consideration whether or not some compensation could be paid to that tenant. The noble Earl has a tender heart, as we all know, but he has a hard taskmaster over him in the person of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and when he went to the Treasury and asked them whether they would find any money to compensate this gentleman who had been
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0618"/>
<col>1223</col>
dispossessed of his farm the answer was they would not give him a single sixpence; and that answer has had to be given&#x2014;not by any fault of the noble Earl&#x2014;to the person who was turned out of his farm.<lb/>
There is one other matter the noble Earl did not refer to. I should have been glad if he could have told us the exact views he holds upon the subject. I refer to his having said that noble Lords upon this side of the House had threatened to wreck the Small Holdings Bill if there were any clauses for compensation put into it. I should be glad to know whether the noble Earl admits that soft impeachment, and if so in what manner he proposes to justify it. At this hour and with this thin attendance I do not propose to press your Lordships to a Division. It is quite sufficient to have elicited the debate we have had, and I shall rely, as each successive measure comes before your Lordships' House, upon the opportunity that will be afforded of offering some observations with a view to the amendment of the provisions for the compulsory purchase of land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03639"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I apologise to my noble friend for having forgotten to answer that last question. I need hardly say that I never said to anybody at any time that if compensation were insisted on in the Small Holdings Bill the Tory Lords told me they would wreck the Bill. There is not the smallest justification for that, and it really shows the danger of gentlemen, with the best possible intentions, repeating conversations second-hand. When the Land Tenure Bill was before the House
<col>1224</col>
I wanted to introduce into that measure, in the compensation for disturbance clause, compensation for tenants who had portions of their land taken for small holdings. I saw there was a good deal of difficulty about that and I consulted a third man, not a member of your Lordships' House, and asked him what I had better do. He said that the House of Lords would probably object very strongly to compensation for disturbance, that it was a very moot point whether they would allow that to go through, and that if I wanted to secure the Bill it would be the stupidest thing in the world to overload the Bill. He said, "If you put that clause in, it is absolutely certain to wreck it," so I left it out, and compensation was never put into the Bill. I admit there is a great deal to be said for it, and a great deal more to be said in the case where the State takes land for the Small Holdings Act. In Grand Committee that Amendment was moved, but then it was pointed out that compensation could not be paid out of the public purse for what landlords did not&#x2014;I do not say would not&#x2014;pay out of their private purse. So the matter ended, and that was why it was never debated in the House of Commons. I am much obliged to the noble Earl for giving me the opportunity of saying that the statement made was an entirely erroneous description of the conversation, and that I never said anything of the sort ascribed to me.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DEVELOPMENT AND ROAD IMPROVE<lb/> MENT FUNDS BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03643" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03644">Order of the Day for the Second Reading, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03645"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to move the Second Reading of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Bill perhaps I may be permitted to say that this Bill marks another step forward in the land policy of the Government outlined by the late Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman at the Albert Hall in 1906. As regards agricultural landlords, we consider that the present method of levying Income Tax is not altogether fair to agricultural land, imposed as it was by a Chancellor of the Exchequer of the opposite side of politics to ourselves some sixty years ago, and in which there has been no alteration up to the present time; but in a few days I hope that we may be able to submit to your Lordships some proposals for the relief of agricultural landlords, who really have some cause to complain, and also a scheme by which Death Duties, which are somewhat heavy, may be paid in land as well as in cash.<lb/>
We have done what we could for the farmers of England by the Land Tenure Bill. We have also tried to help by the Small Holdings Act the agricultural labourer and the landless man, although we have not been so fortunate in your Lordships' House with the Housing Bill, in piloting which, if I may be permitted to say so, my noble friend Lord Beauchamp has appeared to so much advantage. Now the Government are proposing to try to follow the example of other nations by bringing in State assistance to the development of our great national industry by the
<col>1226</col>
Bill now before the House. Some time ago the Chancellor of the Exchequer consulted me in regard to the agricultural interest and what he said I may, perhaps, be permitted to repeat in the words that he himself used in the House of Commons. He said there is a certain amount of money&#x2014;not very much&#x2014;spent in a spasmodic way in the development of national industry, on light railways, on harbours, and indirectly and to a meagre extent for the interest of agriculture, and he said he proposed to gather all these grants into one grant. On the Second Reading of the Budget my right hon. friend, according to <i>Hansard</i>, Vol. 6, page 340, used some words which I hope your Lordships will allow me to read, as they are very important. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We are proposing a grant for the purpose of doing that class of work which is now very largely done by the great landowners themselves, and this will come to at least a quarter of a million a year, so that we are relieving the great landowners of at least a quarter of a million a year."</quote>
This is received, I notice, with a certain amount of amusement by some noble Lords opposite, and perhaps it may seem an extraordinary proposal to come from a Chancellor of the Exchequer who is credited with somewhat Radical ideas. He is supposed by some people to go too far, and by others not to go far enough. I may remind the House that it has been publicly thrown in my right hon. friend's teeth that he is a solicitor and a Welshman. I venture, my Lords, to think that perhaps these two facts go some long way to explain the practical sympathy which my right hon. friend has always shown towards the agricultural interest. As a solicitor he has had the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the real difficulties with which agriculturists large and small have to contend, and born and bred among the hard-working farmers of North Wales, he knows from personal experience the passionate attachment to the soil of those among whom he has lived, and the courage and industry which not only Welsh farmers but all farmers display in playing their part in the social and industrial life of the country.<lb/>
Let me now come at once to the Development Bill. It is not a very long Bill and and it is not a very complicated one, whilst there is no previous legislation bound up with it. It is composed of twenty
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0620"/>
<col>1227</col>
clauses and is divided into two parts. The first six clauses relate to development, and the other clauses relate to road improvement. Let me, as briefly as I can, run through our proposals in Part I. The first clause enables the Treasury to make advances by grants or loans to a Government Department or through a Government Department to public authorities, Universities, colleges, associations, or companies not trading for profit. The objects of the Bill are to aid and encourage agriculture, which is put first, and then the promotion of forestry, reclamation and drainage of land, improvement of rural transport&#x2014;leaving roads to be dealt with in the second part of the Bill&#x2014;the construction and improvement of inland navigation and harbours, and the development and improvement of fisheries. It will be seen from the second clause that all grants and advances will be made out of a Development Fund which will be fed in three ways&#x2014;first, by such money as may be voted by Parliament; secondly, by &#x00A3;500,000 charged on the Consolidated Fund for five years; and, thirdly, by the interest on and repayment of advances and miscellaneous receipts. This, my Lords, will be paid into the Development Fund instead of being paid back automatically into the Treasury as is generally the case.<lb/>
As regards the Development Fund, I think most of your Lordships will agree that the proposal opens a very wide question, and that it might become a source of great danger and almost a national danger. If there is one thing which people in public life on both sides of politics insist on it is the cautious administration of public money. The standard of public life in this country is very high, and it would be a grievous thing if any Bill was brought in on either side of politics which would affect it. That was at once pointed out by two Members of the House of Commons, one on each side&#x2014;Mr. Rufus Isaacs on the Liberal side and Lord Robert Cecil on the Conservative side&#x2014;and they plainly showed the danger of putting &#x00A3;500,000 into the absolute control and hands of the Government of the day, whatever that Government might be, as it might end in a scramble for spoils and might be an invitation to almost everybody to press for some share of the grant.<lb/>
I think those of your Lordships&#x2014;and here are a great many&#x2014;who have had
<col>1228</col>
the pleasure of visiting Australia will remember that the great difficulty in the old days there was&#x2014;I do not know if it is so now&#x2014;that Members of Parliament were known as roads and bridges Members, and their seats entirely depended on the public works which they could induce the Ministry of the day to commence and continue in their constituencies. Speaking in the name of the Government, I ought to express our gratitude to Lord Robert Cecil for the statesmanlike way in which he showed this possible danger and for the machinery which he put forward to avoid it. That machinery was at once adopted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and is now part and parcel of the Bill. To prevent any possible danger of political pressure we propose that the Treasury should appoint five Commissioners, who must be men of independent mind, great capacity, high standing, and high character. They will be appointed by the Treasury for ten years, and two of them will be paid salaries which in the aggregate will not amount to more than &#x00A3;3,000 a year&#x2014;and which will be paid out of the Development Fund, We hope that that money will be sufficient to ensure the Government getting the very best and highest class of men for the positions. Three are to form a quorum. With the consent of the Treasury, of course, they can appoint their officers and servants and give certain salaries that they may think fit. The Treasury will refer every application that may be made by a Government Department to these Commissioners; but if the applicants are any other body, as mentioned in Clause 1 of the Bill, the Treasury will at once send the application to the Government Department which is concerned to report, and then the Government Department will refer the scheme to the Development Commissioners. Then, of course, whether the scheme is carried through or not will depend on whether it meets with the sanction or refusal of the Treasury.<lb/>
The Commissioners&#x2014;and I hope your Lordships will consider this right&#x2014;will consider and report at once to the Treasury on every application. They may hold inquiries and appoint advisory committees who may report to them, and they can authorise applicants to obtain land compulsorily, and a single arbitrator will decide the compensation and costs to be paid. I need hardly say that no ten per cent. will be given for compulsory
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0621"/>
<col>1229</col>
purchase of land so that there should be no difficulty or grumbling about who the arbitrator should be. The arbitrator will be appointed in England by the Lord Chief Justice, in Scotland by the Lord President of the Court of Session, and in Ireland by the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. There is an exemption in regard to compulsory acquisition of land in favour of parks, gardens, home farms, and places of historic interest in the words of the decision to which your Lordships came to after so much time and trouble in Section 41 of the Small Holdings Act. I daresay your Lordships will remember the great pains and trouble this House took in determining a somewhat difficult business. As in Clause 41 of the Small Holdings Act so in Clause 5 of the Bill now before your Lordships, undue disturbance of farmers and labourers shall be avoided as far as possible. That brings me down to the end of Part I of the Bill.<lb/>
Now, with your Lordships' permission I will explain as briefly and as clearly as I can the intentions of His Majesty's Government with regard to the Road Improvements Part of the Bill&#x2014;that is, from Clause 7 to Clause 20, and the Schedule, which, of course, applies to both parts of the Bill. The object of the Government in the second part of the Bill is to improve the road traffic in the United Kingdom, and to cope with the difficulties which have cropped up in the three Kingdoms since the introduction of motor traffic, such as the peril to pedestrians in crowded places, which I am afraid is very great, and the dust nuisance. To deal with these questions, the Government propose to appoint a Road Board for the whole of the United Kingdom. The members of this Board, like the Development Commissioners, will be appointed by the Treasury. That is in Clause 7. The number of members of this Board is not, like the Development Commissioners, limited to five, but is left open. There was a long debate on this point in the House of Commons, and it was thought better to leave the number of members of the Road Board open, and it will be determined by the Treasury. I understand the number is not to be a very large one, and probably it will be the same as the Development Commissioners, probably five in number. Either the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board will be a paid member, and the Board will be a
<col>1230</col>
body corporate with power to hold land without having to apply to the Home Office for a licence. The Board can in the same way as the Development Commissioners, under the sanction of the Treasury, appoint their own officers and servants and pay certain salaries subject to the approval of the Treasury. The duties of the Board will be to administer what is called in the Bill the Road Grant, which is estimated at &#x00A3;600,000 more or less, which under the Finance Bill is to be obtained from the motor and motor spirit taxes. The money will be spent either in the construction of new roads or the maintenance and improvement of existing roads. The Road Board can only construct or maintain new roads while the highway authorities can construct new roads or improve existing roads. I think those of your Lordships who use motor cars will see how necessary a thing that is. With the approval of the Treasury the Road Board can make advances to the highway authorities to make or improve roads and bridges. The word "bridges" will not be found in the clause, and the reason is that the word "roads" includes bridges and subways under roads, so that the word "road" is alone necessary. The proposal that the Road Board shall have power to construct and maintain any new road has been severely criticised, but the Government consider that it is essential to the Bill. The Board will also have the same power as county councils except, of course, that of levying rates, the money being found from the taxes on motors and motor spirits as I said before.<lb/>
There was one great public objection when this Bill was first introduced, and about which I have no doubt we shall hear something in your Lordships' House as regards these new roads being made as motor roads only. There was a considerable and not unnatural objection amongst the general public to public money being spent for motor roads only. Of course, there was a great deal in that objection, and motorists, as a rule, are not perhaps the most popular class in England at the present time. It will, therefore, be found in subsection (1) of Clause 9 that all these new roads are to become public highways, open to every sort of traffic and not to motors only. There is something else to protect the public and to prevent any wild-cat schemes&#x2014;namely, that the Treasury shall consult with the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0622"/>
<col>1231</col>
Local Government Board before giving approval to the making of a new road by the Road Board.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, we have heard a great deal about the horrors of bureaucracy. There seems to be a terrible fear of this new idea, and I may say at once that there is no intention in any way of interfering under this Bill with the local road authorities. On the contrary, my Lords, it may be said that they are roped-in under the Bill, and every facility will be given them, and the great anxiety is to work the existing highway authorities into the scheme so far as can reasonably be done. Therefore, these new roads, which will be called loop roads, and will go one side or the other or round villages to prevent motor cars rushing though them where, in some cases, the cottages have been built right up to the highway so that children coming from school step right into the danger of the street or road. These new loop roads should invariably be made by the county councils. If the local authority want to make a new road, which would be a very serious and expensive undertaking, it will have to submit its scheme to the Road Board, who will, of course, give it every possible consideration and either refuse or sanction it. But to make, as it may be necessary perhaps to make in days to come, a new road forty miles long running through perhaps a dozen local authorities' areas would be a very difficult thing unless you had some central authority to tackle so big an undertaking.<lb/>
If the Road Board submitted a scheme to make a new road each local authority through whose area the road would have to be made would have an opportunity to state its case and objections, though they would not have the power as in London at present, absolutely to stop the road. Their objection would either be upheld or overruled for the public good, but even then the consent of the Treasury would be necessary, and, as a further check, the Treasury would be required to consult with the Local Government Board. Of course the expense of making these new roads would be extremely great, and it would be impossible to make a forty or twenty mile road out of the Road Grant. The making of the roads would naturally become a capital expenditure put over a certain term of years, but to prevent any enthusiasm and to check
<col>1232</col>
the aspirations of any persons who may be supposed to go ahead too fast there is a clause in the Bill which says that practically not more than one-third of the Road Grant of &#x00A3;600,000, or not more than &#x00A3;200,000, is to be spent in any one year by the Road Board on new roads, including interest and sinking fund.<lb/>
Then comes another proposal about which I am anxious to hear what some of your Lordships have to say. It is a new proposal, although well known in other parts of the world. It is that where the Road Board propose to make a new road they shall have the power to acquire not only the amount of land necessary to make the road, but a certain amount of land on each side. They will have the power to acquire 220 yards on each side of the road, and the reason for that to my mind is unanswerable. I think it is very plain and requires no argument to show that money spent by the State for public utility, comfort, and safety should not be used to develop the estates of individual men.<lb/>
This power, however, is not a very dangerous one, because it is only permissive and there are two very strong safeguards against its unreasonable exercise. First, and I am almost afraid to mention it, there is the safeguard of the commonsense and high sense of duty of the gentlemen who will compose the Road Board. They would say to private proprietors, "We give full compensation, of course, but we are not going to give you all the benefits of public expenditure." Secondly, the power of the Board for the compulsory purchase of land under Clause 11 cannot be put into force without the consent of the Development Commissioners as well. Your Lordships, therefore, will see that there is a double safeguard. There is the safeguard of the commonsense and high sense of duty of the Road Board, and there is the safeguard of the sanction of a perfectly independent body of high-class gentlemen, the Development Commissioners. Above all this there is the consent of the Treasury.<lb/>
I have now only to point out Clause 18, which contains the obligation to consider the state and prospects of employment at the time the roads are proposed to be made. I have tried as briefly and clearly as possible to explain what this Bill is. Now let me
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0623"/>
<col>1233</col>
try to explain what it is not. It is not in any way, shape, or sort a Right to Work Bill, nor is it a Bill in any way for the relief of unemployment. Still less is it intended to be&#x2014;and if it is it will, of course, be altered at once to its great advantage&#x2014;a Bill for the relief of rates. That great and serious problem must be tackled, and tackled before long, either by this Government or another, but I think the House will agree with me when I say that under the terms of this Bill this is not the way to do it. If any attempt of that sort was made under this Bill the money would simply be wasted and would make no impression of any possible value whatever either on the roads or the rates. In a word, the object the Government have in bringing forward this Bill is to help local authorities to improve existing roads by easing dangerous corners, or by easing dangerous gradients, by widening roads, or making loop roads round villages where motors are a danger, and, where highway authorities cannot make these new roads, to enable the Road Board to do so, due regard being had for the state of employment at the time. Under Clause 19, the last clause but one in the Bill, there is a special provision for the protection of commons and open spaces, about which many of your Lordships take a keen interest. And now I have tried, my Lords, as briefly as possible to explain to your Lordships' House what this Bill is and what it is not. All that remains to me now is most respectfully and hopefully to ask your Lordships to be pleased to give a Second Reading the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03646">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Carrington</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03647"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl began the interesting speech which he has just concluded by a general claim on the part of His Majesty's Government to be favourable to the agricultural interest of this country. It seems that they have done good or tried to do good to every class interested in agriculture, and he specially dwelt upon the advantage which he and his colleagues have conferred upon agriculturists in the matter of the Income Tax. He said that an iniquitous Chancellor of the Exchequer belonging to the Party sitting on this side of your Lordships' House in a previous period of our history&#x2014;I think some sixty years ago&#x2014;
<col>1234</col>
imposed a very unfair Income Tax on the agricultural interest, and that it was the intention of His Majesty's Government to remedy that injustice. Well, I am very glad to hear that. A rumour of something of the kind has reached us, but we could feel greater comfort if we did not know that as the total Income Tax is to be 1<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3; even a considerable relief will still leave us rather great losers as compared with the penny or twopence originally imposed by the iniquitous Chancellor of the Exchequer who belonged to the Party which sits on this side of the House.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl, having pronounced a general eulogy on the Government, pronounced a special eulogy on the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It seems that, notwithstanding the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is both a solicitor and a Welshman, he takes an interest in agricultural matters. I think I remember not so very long ago the interest which Mr. Lloyd-George took in the passage of the Agricultural Rates Act. It is not very ancient history. I think I was in the House of Commons at that time, and if I remember aright we had to sit up rather late for several nights listening to Mr. Lloyd-George opposing that measure which was designed to meet the agricultural interest of this country. I am afraid we have not as great confidence as the noble Earl has in the admirable agricultural qualities of his right hon. friend and colleague.<lb/>
There was one observation in the noble Earl's speech which especially struck me. He was evidently rather anxious to prove that this was not a bureaucratic measure. I wonder, if he will allow me to say so, he had the face to make such an observation. Nothing is more interesting, nothing more pathetic, than the gradual disillusionment of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party used to believe in the people, in the wisdom of Parliament, in the merits of local self-government; now, however, all these old faiths are being gradually shed. Do they trust the people? Why, my Lords, the very suggestion to them that there ought to be a dissolution of Parliament makes them shudder. Do they believe in local self-government? I think your Lordships have seen indications within the past few weeks tending in the direction of limiting local self-government rather than of increasing it. The old policy of trust in local
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0624"/>
<col>1235</col>
self-government, indeed, is now replaced by what I may call the policy of "ginger"&#x2014;unmixed ginger, undiluted ginger. Well, my Lords, I think a diet of that kind would disagree with any one. In the days of the old belief of the Liberal Party in the wisdom of Parliament there was a meticulous care shown that every project should be brought before Parliament and every detail was set out with the greatest care in the clauses of a Bill. Nothing was handed over to subordinate authorities which it was thought Parliament itself ought to take care of. All that has been changed. Now there are rules, clauses, legislation by reference, and closure and the "guillotine" in the House of Commons, all demonstrating the faith which the Liberal Party now possess in the wisdom of Parliament and of the House of Commons.<lb/>
My Lords, this Bill, of course, is a signal instance of how no longer is there to be trust placed in Parliament, in the local authorities, or in the people. We are no longer asked to trust the people. The country was asked, until the Bill came to be considered in another place, not to trust the people but to trust the Chancellor of the Exchequer. What trust did they ask that we should repose in the Chancellor of the Exchequer? It was almost unlimited. I do not suppose there ever was a clause drawn in such general terms as was shown in the case of Clause 1. Every conceivable subject was to be left to the determination of the Treasury&#x2014;agriculture, rural industries, co-operation, small holdings, forestry, transport, light railways, harbours and canals, fisheries, and, in case all these things should not be enough, there was a sort of general term to cover all advances "for any other purpose calculated to promote the economic development of the United Kingdom." All these subjects were handed over lock, stock, and barrel to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. As it were, the reins were to be thrown on the right hon. gentleman's neck so that he should be allowed to go where he liked. But, as the noble Earl has reminded us, that proposition was too much even for the present majority of the House of Commons. There was a sort of universal feeling that such a proposal could not be endured. I have to thank the noble Earl for the very kind terms in which he spoke of one or two Members of another place, one of whom I know very well, but I do not think that noble relative of mine would have been
<col>1236</col>
enabled to carry out the change, or induce the House of Commons to carry out the change which has been effected in the Bill, had it not been that there was a general feeling on both sides of the House that to entrust a Government Department with these unfettered powers and a very large sum of money was so dangerous that the risk must be avoided at all hazards. The result was the appointment of the Commission; but even in the case of the Commission the powers are very great to be entrusted to any body of men.<lb/>
First of all, I should like to ask the Government how much money they contemplate using under this Development Bill. The noble Earl, perhaps because he holds a strong view about the privileges of the House of Commons, did not deal with the money question at all, but it is essential if we are to understand the Bill. As I understand, there are two main sources from which money is drawn for the development part of the Bill, and one for the roads part. The two main sources of the development part of the Bill are the Consolidated Fund and money provided by Parliament upon the Estimates every year. I do not comment upon the very remarkable proposal that part of this money should be drawn from the Consolidated Fund. I should think that is unique in our legislation for a purpose of this kind. The Consolidated Fund is generally used to provide salaries for Judges, paying off the National Debt, and matters of that kind, but that it should be used for this purposa&#x2014;whatever our opinion is as to the very doubtful matters which form the subject of this Bill&#x2014;is, I should think, unique. At any rate, a very large sum is to be drawn from the Consolidated Fund. I understand it is &#x00A3;500,000 for five years&#x2014;that is, &#x00A3;2,500,000. Then there is also the sum of money to be provided on the Estimates. I should like to ask the Government how much money they contemplate providing from that source. It is a perfectly elastic term as it stands. It may be another &#x00A3;500,000 a year or it may be a great deal more; but, supposing it is to be &#x00A3;500,000 a year, that with the other amount would mean the considerable sum of &#x00A3;5,000,000 in the course of the next five years. To that must be added, of course, the sum of money which is to be allotted for the roads. Well, my Lords, that is a very large sum. I am astonished that the Government propose at the outset to use so much. This Bill is
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0625"/>
<col>1237</col>
evidently an experiment, and is in some respects a very doubtful experiment. One would have thought that a prudent Government would have begun with a small sum and seen how that worked before asking Parliament to provide more; but this Government always think in millions and they evidently consider that the present time is an opportune one for launching out. It is quite true that we have to provide a very large sum of money for old age pensions and that we have a very large call upon us in order to make proper provision for our Navy. Yet in the Government's opinion that is precisely the occasion when they may add four or five millions more on what must be considered as rather a doubtful experiment. That is the first question I would like to put to the Government.<lb/>
The next question I wish to ask the noble Earl or one of his colleagues is whether he can give us any closer indication of the objects for which this Bill is to be used. Surely they do not think that Parliament ought to be satisfied with the terms of the general clause which I have read out, and which I think the noble Earl also read out. Surely they must have a policy on the matter. They have got a policy on a great many questions. They have a policy on this. They have thought what harbours ought to be set on foot, where there is this great demand for main roads, in what direction rural industry may properly be helped&#x2014;all these things I have no doubt the strongest and ablest Government of modern times have thought out. But why will they not confide it to Parliament? Why are we asked to devote these enormous sums for these very vague objects? I am quite sure these were not the ways in which their predecessors asked Parliament to legislate. In the absence of any such assurances I expect your Lordships will think it right to suggest a few limitations in Clause 1. I think especially that the very general words about the economic development of the United Kingdom might be a little more closely defined, and perhaps other Amendments might be suggested. I notice there is one rather good subsection in the clause&#x2014;subsection (3)&#x2014;which proposes that in giving moneys for certain purposes the Acts of Parliament which already govern those purposes should govern the grant. That seems rather a good subsection; it is a little unfortunate that it was not inserted by His Majesty's Govern-
<col>1238</col>
ment, and I dare say your Lordships might consider the propriety of enlarging the scope of that subsection.<lb/>
I would ask a further question. If we are to agree to and vote all these large sums of money, and if we are to pass these very general powers, it becomes of great importance to your Lordships and the country to know who are going to administer them. The noble Earl has told us that there will be five Commissioners. It would be very interesting to know who those Commissioners are going to be. I do not think that is a very extravagant request to put to the Government. Your Lordships must remember that the Development Bill was mentioned in considerable detail in Mr. Lloyd-George's Budget statement, I do not know how many months ago, and between then and now I should have imagined that the Government must have had time to make up their minds who the Commissioners are in whom this great trust is to be reposed. They must be men of the highest calibre. Perhaps the noble Earl can tell us who they are. It is not very easy to find men of the highest calibre, especially as three out of the five are not going to be paid. But we must hope for the best.<lb/>
This leads me to another observation. The multiplication of these commissioners and departments and boards will one of these days exhaust all the suitable men who can be found to man them. We must, I think, make some effort to simplify if we can the multiplication of these authorities, and perhaps your Lordships will find an opportunity of doing this in the Bill which is under your consideration at the present moment. Then, again, why should there be two parts to this Bill, one part to be managed by the Development Commissioners and the other by a Road Board? Roads are only a form of development, and if you can get first-rate men to administer the development part, surely the wise and prudent method would be to entrust to them also the control of the roads. When the Government first introduced this Bill and had one of their magnificent conceptions of a new system of motor roads running right through the length and breadth of the land there was at that time perhaps something to be said for a separate authority to control them; but now we understand that that scheme has been abandoned. That was one of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0626"/>
<col>1239</col>
the proposals of the Government which vanished under discussion in the House of Commons, and in consequence the whole scope of the road part of the Bill has been enormously diminished in importance; and it does seem to me not only a waste of public money but of the strength of these first-rate public men of whom I have spoken to have two authorities where one would do perfectly adequately for the whole purpose.<lb/>
Whatever your Lordships may decide as to the authority, of course the road portion of the Bill or some of its clauses must remain an integral part of the measure. As regards these roads, all the roads are to be ordinary main roads upon which all His Majesty's subjects are to have the right of passage whether they go in motors or anything else, or whether they go on their own legs. The noble Earl defended this wonderful proposal of the two strips, one down each side of the road. They are to be on occasion, I understand, as much as 220 yards wide on either side; that is, a paltry strip of 440 yards which is to be taken under the compulsory powers of the Bill for these roads. My Lords, I really hardly think it necessary to argue such a proposal. What are the Road Board going to do with this land? Are they going to farm it, or are they going to turn it into one long series of small holdings? The truth is that they would not know what to do with it. The noble Earl defended this proposal on the ground that these roads would raise very much the price of property, and that therefore the State ought to have the opportunity of recouping itself by the enhanced value of the land for the price of the road. But I may tell him that the passage of a motor road through a district does not enhance the value of property; on the contrary, it always diminishes it. That appears to deprive the Government of the one and only defence they have for this remarkable proposition, so that I do not imagine they will shed many tears when that particular provision disappears from the Bill.<lb/>
As the Bill now stands, what is in effect proposed is that there shall be two classes of main roads: the ordinary main roads which have hitherto existed controlled entirely by the counties, and these other main roads which are to be made with the money of the Road Board, and, I suppose,
<col>1240</col>
controlled by the Road Board. I do not think that the noble Earl has made out any case for these two classes of main roads. At the same time, it is quite true that localities deserve and ought to receive more assistance in the shape of national funds for the maintenance of main roads. I have some little knowledge of the matter myself as I have the good fortune to live in the county of Hertfordshire. That county is traversed by a number of very important main roads leading out of London, and those main roads are used increasingly by very heavy motor traffic. Since the motor traffic began the cost of the maintenance of these main roads has been enormously increased, and yet, of course, up to now motorists who have been the cause of this increase of cost have not contributed anything towards it, and it is a gross and indefensible hardship that the ratepayers of Hertfordshire should have to pay the whole cost of the maintenance of roads which are used and worn out by other people. Therefore, so far as the proposal of the Government goes that the authorities who maintain these roads should be further assisted by the taxpayers' money in order to maintain them, it will I am sure receive general assent from all parts of your Lordships' House. But when we come to the further conditions under which those grants are to be made, I only have to say this, that I do not think any charge by way of increasing the size of the roads or the making of new roads should be thrown upon the ratepayers without the consent of the representatives of the ratepayers. That appears to be a very clear and well understood principle, and I hope the Government will consider that before the Bill finally passes through your Lordships' House. Upon this subject I should like to add this, that I do think a case has been made out for the making of roads by the present local authorities with the assistance of the Government round dangerous places, or to avoid villages, or matters of that kind, as the noble Lord said. I think that is a thing that is very much desired in many parts of the country and would be warmly welcomed. For those purposes, and for other purposes connected with roads, it is quite right that there should be some form of compulsory power. I do not think it right, and I am sure your Lordships do not think it right, that any landowner should allow his own private convenience to stand in the way
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0627"/>
<col>1241</col>
of the public convenience when it is a question of making a new road, or, indeed, any highway which is useful to the public; and so far as I am concerned, and I am sure I speak for all those who sit on this Bench, I should be quite ready to consent to compulsory powers being accorded to the road authorities through the instrumentality of the Road Board, or whatever takes the place of the Road Board, in order that these necessary improvements should be carried cut.<lb/>
I have only one more word to say with respect to the clauses of the Bill, and that is as to Clause 18, which deals with the unemployed. I noticed that the noble Earl was very anxious to repudiate the idea that this was what he called a Right to Work Bill. I do not know that it is very important what phrase we use in order to describe the clause, but undoubtedly the clause embodies a principle which is of very doubtful value. I do not mean to say that in administering a Bill like this no regard should be paid to the difficulties of the unemployed. That, I think, would be going much too far. For example, it appears to me to be quite reasonable, where a great public work has to be carried out, that the season of the year which is likely to meet the wants of the unemployed should be chosen in which to carry out the work rather than some other period of the year. During the summer much labour is employed in agriculture, in building, and so on, which cannot be employed in the winter, and it might be very proper that any road-making, for example, which has to be carried out under the operations of this Bill should be concentrated in the winter months, in order, as far as possible, to provide work when work is most required. But that is a very different thing from saying that a particular public improvement or work should be determined by a consideration as to whether persons are or are not out of work in the district. That comes perilously near to starting relief works as we have known them in the last few years; and I have acquired the impression that all the best authorities now agree in saying that relief works are a profound mistake. I notice that so good a Liberal as the noble Lord, Lord Courtney, signifies his assent to that proposition, and I believe it to be true. I speak not with absolute authority, but I rather think the Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law was very strongly against the system of relief works.<lb/>
<col>1242</col>
In the face of such a pronouncement of opinion I think it a very doubtful policy of the Government to put forward a proposal which it is somewhat difficult to distinguish from relief works as we have known them. That matter also will no doubt receive the consideration of your Lordships when we arrive at the Committee stage of this Bill. I think your Lordships will have perceived that so far as those of us who sit on this Bench are concerned, we desire to offer no opposition whatever to the Second Reading of this Bill. We recognise that there is something to be done, and we believe that some good can be effected by the judicious application of public money; and though most of us think that the machinery of this Bill is rather absurd, and that it goes very much too far, yet we may hope that in the course of its passage through its other stages in your Lordships' House some of the main dangers, I will not say all of them, which we see in the provisions of the Bill may be eliminated, and that at any rate some good will emerge to the benefit of the people of the country at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03648"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in some respects this Bill falls far short of what I should wish to see in reference to the creation of roads. I cannot help thinking that with regard to the creation of rights of way we are in a very antiquated and inefficient condition in this country. At present, no new right of way can be created, not even a footpath, against the wishes of the owners of the land, short of by an Act of Parliament. I cannot help thinking that we fall very far behind other countries, and I feel myself that an authority like a county council might perfectly well be trusted with the absolute power of deciding within their area whether any new road, a main road or a by-road or even a footpath, should be created or not, and a right of way acquired, even against the will of the owner of the land. Under this Bill new roads will only be created with the approval of the Road Board. I agree with the noble Marquess that local authorities should be encouraged as much as possible, and I think the county council might be entrusted with the power, on the application of a local authority, to determine whether or not it is desirable that a new right of way should be acquired.<lb/>
There is another point in the Bill with regard to which I should like a little
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0628"/>
<col>1243</col>
explanation. I am not going to discuss the exact limit of 220 yards on each side of the road. I think in rural districts a frontage 220 yards deep is more than would be needful or useful for building, and much more than would be required for recoupment to the authority which makes the road. But I should not raise objection to the 220 yards if the Road Board thought it desirable. Assuming that it is desirable in order to enable the persons constructing the new road to recoup themselves to some extent by owning the frontages on the new road, as I read the Bill that right is only conferred on the Road Board if they make the road, but not on the local authority if they, even with the aid of the Road Board, make the road themselves. I see no reason why the local authority should not be able to recoup themselves also. It seems to me that whatever right of acquiring frontages is granted to one authority for the purposes of recoupment ought to be granted to the other. If the ratepayers of a county go to the expense of making a new road, why should they not have the same power of recoupment that would be granted to this Governmental body if they make the new road?<lb/>
Another point that occurs to me as I read the Bill is that apparently when the Road Board make a new road through a person's land they may take the whole of the frontage down to 220 yards deep on either side, and there is no obligation on them, in setting out the new road, to give the owner, whose land will become back land, any title to claim rights of way over these 220 yards. It may be a very good principle, and I have not the slightest objection to it, that there should be recoupment for the public authority which is put to the expense of making a new road, but it does seem to me to be unfair when a new road is made through a person's land that the owner should find himself liable to have his land shut out and all access to it cut off; and if I may use the expression of an eminent Statesman, which has become classical, he might be blackmailed before he could get access over land which was at one time his own. I think, therefore, when one of these new roads is being made with the 220 yards on each side, that the owner of the land should be entitled to claim reasonable roads running back from the new road giving access to his land and preventing it from becoming back land. That is a matter which does not
<col>1244</col>
affect the principle of the Bill, and I have no doubt that the noble Earl in charge of the Bill will bear that in mind in Committee.<lb/>
I rather agree with the observations of the noble Marquess with regard to Clause 18. I thought that in Committee the representative of the Government agreed to drop out the reference to employment. It seems to me that in going in for any work for the benefit of the community and paid for by the money of the ratepayers, the authorities ought to have regard to the most businesslike way in which it can be carried out; and although these words seem harmless, and have been represented as harmless, yet they have been taken hold of by some people as a recognition of the principle of the right to work; and to provide work for people who are not fit for the work is a most wasteful and demoralising way of spending public money. Again, I do not believe it will be practicable to construct an important main road only during the winter months. No railway contractor, for example, would ever dream of sending his men to construct a new piece of line during the winter months only. The construction of new roads is a matter of skilled work with experienced and good men working continuously at it, and I should much prefer to leave the road authority, whether the local authority or the Government, a perfectly free hand to carry out the work as efficiently and as economically as possible.<lb/>
I agree to a certain extent also with what the noble Marquess said as to the last paragraph of subsection (1) of Clause 1. As the Minister in charge of the Bill in the House of Commons said, it is a well known maxim of law that general words at the end of a long string of particulars are never taken to enlarge those particulars, but must be taken as matters <i>ejusdem generis</i>. Perhaps we shall have that repeated again in the course of the debate from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, but it ought to be quite clearly understood that it is not intended that there should be a roving commission to embark in wild or remote schemes, and that the letters of the clause down to (<i>g</i>) really embrace broadly the substance of the things intended to be done.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1245</col>
I touch very briefly on a particular subject in which I am interested and with which this Bill proposes to deal&#x2014;that is, the subjects mentioned in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of Clause 1. I have for a good many years past taken a great interest and actively participated in the administration of higher agricultural education. In that capacity I confess that I have been keenly disappointed with the speech in which my noble friend, Lord Carrington, introduced this Bill, in consequence of the fact that, beyond reading in very general terms those sub-clauses, he did not allude at all to the urgency and importance of this topic. The noble Earl will forgive me if I remind him that he is perfectly well acquainted with the history of the subject, but I have jotted down a date or two for the purpose of refreshing his recollection.<lb/>
Towards the end of the year 1905 a deputation from the principal colleges waited upon the President of the Board of Agriculture to urge upon the Board the utter inadequacy of the funds at their disposal for carrying out properly and efficiently the work of agricultural education with which they were charged. Six months elapsed, and then I, in this House, asked the noble Earl whether the representations of that deputation had been considered and whether any steps had been taken to give effect to them. Lord Carrington very kindly informed me that he considered the matter one of very great importance, and he undertook to see that some kind of inquiry into the subject was made. Another six months elapsed, and in response to a further inquiry from myself Lord Carrington announced that a Departmental Committee was going to be appointed to inquire into the whole subject. I think most of your Lordships know that that Committee met under the Presidency of Lord Reay and issued a Report which I trust agriculturists both in and out of this House will agree with me was of very great value and importance. But meanwhile, my Lords, time is steadily stepping on, and nothing has been done. A year ago my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton very kindly brought the subject before the notice of the House, and the President of the Board of Agriculture informed him that he hoped that before very long he would have some more money at his disposal for these colleges, and Lord Belper said on that occasion that he trusted those were not idle words.<lb/>
<col>1246</col>
What I regret the President of the Board of Agriculture has not informed the House to-day is whether or not paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are intended to give effect to the suggestions made by Lord Reay's Committee. If they are, I must for a second time express my regret that this means is taken of carrying out the proposal. The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, has already drawn the attention of the House to the somewhat elaborate procedure which has to be adopted for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Bill. Supposing that the college with which I am connected requires, as it certainly will do, further funds to enable it to increase and effectually carry out its work, what are we to do? I assume that we shall have to make an application to Government Department No. 1, the Board of Agriculture. The Board of Agriculture will then make a representation to Government Department No. 2, the Development Commissioners. They will then prepare a scheme and submit it to Government Department No. 3, the Treasury. The Treasury, assuming for one moment that they approve it, will then return the scheme to the Board of Agriculture, which for this purpose might almost be considered Government Department No. 4, and they would eventually get the money. No money, I gather, will be available under this Act, if it becomes law, for some considerable time&#x2014;not until the year ending March, 1911. So that it is quite evident, my Lords, there will be no money available for higher agricultural education for some considerable time.<lb/>
I have already drawn the attention of the House to the fact that four years have now elapsed since the urgency of the question was first brought before His Majesty's Government, and the reason I am disappointed is that the noble Earl did not do, what we all hoped he would do, go to the Treasury as soon as he was fortified by the Report of Lord Reay's Committee, and say simply and plainly, "I am convinced in my own mind that further money is required in the interests of the country for this important object. Will you increase the grant?"&#x2014;because there is at present a grant, although a very small one&#x2014;" and place a sum of money at my disposal for distribution as I think best among these colleges?" Now what will our position be? There are seven or eight different objects to which the funds
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0630"/>
<col>1247</col>
at the disposal of the Development Commissioners are to be applied, and the sum will not be a very large one, as has already been pointed out. Harbours, reclamation of land, light railways, and inland navigation are decidedly costly matters, and what I want to know is, what chance will the agricultural colleges have of getting anything at all when these very large interests have received adequate attention? I sincerely trust that the order in which the subjects are mentioned in the clause is an indication of their importance, although I fail to see the necessity for this very elaborate and circuitous system of arriving at a grant, and we should be glad if the noble Earl could give us an assurance that some simpler and straighter means will be devised for obtaining for these colleges the comparatively small sum they require in order to improve and extend the operations of their work.<lb/>
I ask pardon for trespassing so long upon the time and patience of your Lordships, but I have only done so in consequence of the very strong belief I hold of the urgency of providing funds for extending our very important work, and because it appears to me that under the Bill as it stands we shall get very little and that only at a very deferred period. There is one observation I forgot to make. Whereas, at the present time, England is self-contained for this purpose, in future we shall have to compete with the whole of the United Kingdom, and, as far as I can Judge, Scotland and Ireland up to the present have not been backward in pressing their claims and getting them met; and it appears to me that there is some likelihood of the possibility of the predominant partner rather going to the wall in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03650"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is something, about this Bill which appears to me to be really a little grotesque. It reminds me in some respects of what happens in countries where duels are in fashion, where the combatant goes out accompanied by a second who bears in one hand a lethal weapon and in the other a medicine chest. We have not had the lethal weapon yet, but this Bill, particularly under Clause 18, apparently represents the medicine. It seems to provide harmless employment in planting trees and making roads for men who were once engaged as motor drivers or employed in motor works
<col>1248</col>
in the manufacture of commercial vehicles, and I have no doubt there may be others who will only be too glad to seek employment under it. We have been told that that is not the purpose of the Bill, and that it is in no sense a Right to Work Bill, but I have looked up the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in introducing the Bill in the House of Commons nearly six months ago. At the very beginning of his statement he outlined the general character of the Bill and said&#x2014;
<quote>"It also has an indirect but important bearing upon the question of providing useful and not purposeless employment in times of depression."</quote>
That comes in the forefront of the statement of the Chancellor when introducing the Bill, and I think it will, perhaps, be well if it is made clear that it is not intended to provide work for the unemployed at a greatly increased cost.<lb/>
What were the promises which were made in regard to the second part of this Bill when it was introduced? We were told that the Chancellor of the Exchequer welcomed the number of motor cars in use in this country&#x2014;three times as many as in France and more than four times as many as in Germany&#x2014;and the Chancellor looked forward to a great future for this industry; but when it comes to a question of roads and of considering the damage done to the roads of this country, Mr. Lloyd-George says&#x2014;
<quote>"Here is a question which demands the immediate attention of the Government, and motors must be taxed."</quote>
I listened attentively to the interesting speech of the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench, and to a great extent I found myself in agreement with him; but he seemed also to fall into the same unfortunate error that the person who uses the roads should be the person to pay for them. He said that the ratepayers of Hertfordshire were suffering a definite injury and wrong because of the increased expense in the maintenance of their main roads through motor traffic. Might I point out to him, if that argument is right, that the ratepayers who pay for the maintenance of Piccadilly, for example, suffer wrong and injury because the people of Hertfordshire use that thoroughfare whenever they please. The proposition cannot be defended; but that is the ground on which these taxes are to be imposed,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0631"/>
<col>1249</col>
and that is the purpose for which they are to be used, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer says that it is clear that our present system of roads and road-making is inadequate to meet the increasing demands made by the new form of traction.<lb/>
It has been constantly said that our roads have been damaged and worn by one form of traffic more than another, but without some definite and scientific inquiry being made and a definite result arrived at, no person is entitled to make such a statement and have it either accepted or rejected. I agree that it is a great misfortune that we have no central road authority in this country, and if such an authority, in the true sense of the word, were to be established by this Bill it would be a matter for congratulation. We are behind other European countries in the absence of a central road authority, but this Bill is a very ineffective and feeble method of beginning the establishment of such an authority, because a central road authority must obviously interfere with all the local authorities, and the Bill does not propose to do that. Under the Bill it is proposed to take existing roads and to make what I cannot but call little peddling improvements, certain places to be widened and straightened and the corners rounded off. The noble Earl who introduced the Bill said that at some time or other new roads might be made, and in the Bill as introduced undoubtedly there was that proposal. I recognise that that did not meet with public approval, and that it did not and does not meet with the approval of motorists themselves, because they do not want it suggested that motorcars are unfit to be used on the ordinary roads in the country. Nevertheless, in my opinion, a time must come in the development of this country when we must have a national road system with scientifically-made roads corresponding to those in France running from one end of the country to the other. This Bill does not go in that direction, but puts back the hands of the clock by stereotyping the present unscientific methods of making roads in this country.<lb/>
Experts have pointed out again and again that roads can be made very much better than they are now, and an advance would have been made towards an ideal system if the main roads had been entrusted to the care of a central authority, which
<col>1250</col>
might have the money now spent upon roads by the local authorities, and in addition a small grant. The subject is such a difficult and complicated one that I think the first five years of the existence of this Road Board might very well be spent in hoarding their money and considering plans and proposals for making new roads. The matter is not an easy one and cannot be dealt with without a great deal of consideration. Your Lordships may recollect the very magnificent suggestion&#x2014;it never got beyond that&#x2014;made by Mr. Balfour a few years ago for the construction of radiating thoroughfares out of London. Those thoroughfares are very much required. In comparison to the population and wealth of this country the condition of our roads is really behind what it was at the time of the Roman occupation; they are not worthy of us; and my chief objection to this Bill is that it does not go far enough to meet that state of things.<lb/>
From the point of view of the improvement of roads, I seriously suggest to your Lordships that the most important part of this Bill is Clause 14&#x2014;that the Road Board shall make an annual report to the Treasury of its proceedings. By means of that report and the information contained in it, Parliament and the public will, I venture to think, be educated to realising that this subject of roads is an important one and deserves more serious consideration than has been given to it. In addition to motor roads there has also been cut out from the Bill every possible power of regulating and managing these roads in any way whatever. When you have made your road, any person is to be at liberty to drive a flock of sheep over it or to have a herd of cattle wandering along it, or a heavy traction engine cutting its surface up; and even if a council wanted to set aside a portion of a road, one part for motor traffic and another part for ordinary traffic, in order to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the difference in effect between motor traffic and ordinary traffic on the surface of a road, there is no power to do it under the Bill. The Road Board ought to have some sort of power of regulation of these roads in order to prevent their improper use. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the expenditure undertaken out of the fund must be directly referable to work done in connection with the exigencies of the motor
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0632"/>
<col>1251</col>
traffic in this country. That is the promise, this Bill is the performance; there is nothing in the Bill which is directly referable to the motor traffic of the country, and nothing which is even required as regards motor traffic so long as the present exceedingly low speed limit of twenty miles an hour prevails. At present all the roads of the country are practically safe for the traffic they carry. But that was the promise of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and on that understanding the assent of motorists to this Bill was obtained. Here we see the method in which it has been carried out.<lb/>
It is still possible, however, that a great deal of useful work may be done under this Bill if what I believe and hope are actually the intentions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself are carried out by this new Road Board; but for that purpose everything must depend upon the <i>personnel</i> of the Board. In the interests of administration I do not at all dissociate myself from the suggestion of the noble Marquess opposite that it is a pity to have two Boards instead of one, but if you are to give confidence to the motorists of this country that this money is being spent wisely and not dribbled away in grants to local authorities you must place upon the Board a certain number of motorists recognised by the general community as capable and fair-minded men. I feel that a great opportunity has been lost for starting a real central highway system, but all of us interested in good roads hope that this may be the beginning or the nucleus or the seed of some such system, although we look with grave anxiety on the way in which the money is to be administered. If it is to be in tarring roads and dust laying and small improvements here and there of existing roads, really very little will have been achieved, and I would ask His Majesty's Government to consider for some time before they undertake any work under the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03651"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to detain your Lordships more than a few moments with just one or two considerations as to the second part of this Bill. With regard to the Bill as a whole, I will not follow in detail the extremely interesting speech which the noble Marquess made. It seems to me that this Bill bears the hallmark of most of the Radical measures introduced
<col>1252</col>
this session. It is what art dealers would call "signed all over the picture." In order to develop the economic resources of the United Kingdom you have first to take something away from somebody or other by main force, and, secondly, you have to employ a whole army of paid officials for the doing of it. In that sense I think it might very fairly lay claim to be called a Bill for the purpose of creating employment in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
Although we had a very interesting discussion about it yesterday evening, I desire to call attention to the attitude of the Government towards the occupiers of land in this country. The position of the tenant farmer is highly relevant to the consideration of the land which will be taken away under Part II, especially with regard to the making of motor roads. I well remember, if I may say so without disrespect, the almost painful earnestness with which the President of the Board of Agriculture used to appeal to us on behalf of the tenant farmer when the Small Holdings Bill was under discussion&#x2014;what he was suffering from, and how he was liable to be turned out at any moment by a haughty and rapacious landlord. But when the land of the tenant farmer is required for carrying out those great objects on which the mind and the heart of the Liberal Party are set, he becomes a very different sort of person, and the victim of an absolute and oppressive feudalism for the purposes of small holdings becomes or the purposes of road development at once a selfish land grabber occupying land in an unfair and improper manner, and he must surrender it.<lb/>
It is with regard to the land proposed to be taken in the neighbourhood of villages for the purpose of new roads generally that I desire to address your Lordships. It is quite true that the second part of this Bill is a very different sort of thing from what it was as the Bill was first introduced. I have not been behind the scenes at all in this matter, but I suppose it represents the compact that His Majesty's Government on the one side have been able to arrive at with the more moderate motorists on the other, ardent motorists being a kind of third party to the bargain. The original proposal of Lord Montagu would have been to have started an enormous road system all over the United Kingdom upon which motor
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0633"/>
<col>1253</col>
cars might travel as hard as ever they liked. That system would also have found favour, I believe, in the eyes of certain other people because it would have had the additional advantage of constituting a formidable kind of competition with the existing railroad system. However, we will not go into that at the present moment. It has now resolved itself into what we are told is rather a harmless proposal for making new roads round certain villages.<lb/>
I was very sorry to hear the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, give such an unqualified approval to the making of new roads round villages, if he will pardon my saying so, and I hope when such new roads are made that they will be embarked upon very cautiously indeed, because in my opinion you will never settle the motor problem in this country properly until you go to Parliament and get an Act passed and have it rigorously enforced for the purpose of requiring motor cars, and, in fact, all traffic, to go through country villages at a pace consistent with the safety and comfort of the inhabitants. That will be a far cheaper method of securing the comfort of the villagers than by constructing loop roads to travel round them. Is not this land in the neighbourhood of villages which it is proposed to take for the purpose of these roads the very accommodation land which we were told last night by the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, was occupied by dear old John Barleycorn and which his neighbours hung out of their windows looking at with longing eyes? Does the noble Earl suggest that to see a long and noble array of motor cars rushing along the road is a consolation to him for dear old John Barleycorn being deprived of his land? In my opinion that is the worst possible use to which you could put the land in the immediate neighbourhood of a village, and any one who has anything to do with country life knows perfectly well that if you are going to turn the accommodation land in the immediate neighbourhood of country villages into motor tracks by making it into new roads, you are putting it to a use which will neither recommend itself to the owners and occupiers of the land nor to the agricultural labourer or anybody else who has anything to do with it. I submit, with the very greatest respect, that England as a country is not big enough for an enterprise of this
<col>1254</col>
kind. What we wish to have in this country is something like the <i>automobiles an pas</i> or the <i>al passo</i> of Italy. Lord Russell foreshadows a time when these new motor roads that he and Lord Montagu are always talking about will ultimately be made, but I submit that the land we have at our disposal for such a purpose in this country is far too thickly populated and that the country as a whole is not large enough to carry out an enterprise of this kind; and to indulge in speculation and enterprise in road making such as has been foreshadowed by Lord Montagu and Earl Russell is nothing more or less than pandering to the lust of speed and the subsidisation of the road hog. I, for one, sincerely trust that our own Front Bench in their consideration of the Amendments which we are going to move to this Bill, will seriously consider whether it would not be better to apply the money that we have got, and the money that we are going to get, no matter from what source, first to the improvement, and then to the maintenance of the existing roads, before embarking in a speculation for laying down new roads in this country.<lb/>
There is another kind of improvement to the existing roads which I know a great many people think will solve the greater part of the motor car nuisance, and that is lopping off the corners where the road turns round rather too sharply. If you are going to make the corners so that motor cars can go round them at their own pace, which is the sole object of this kind of improvement, let me tell the general public, and I am sure they will agree, that they will be removing the only natural and automatic restriction of speed on the part of motorists which exists at the present time, and which I, for one, will be extremely sorry to see done away with. It is only by the knowledge that he might be brought up sooner or later, probably sooner, at something like a sharp corner, that forms any check upon the ambitions of the motorist at the present day. And there is another reason. A sharp corner which is properly turned is often much safer than a wide corner, as these motorists have an awkward trick of not observing the rule of the road at such places. If you are driving and you come to a corner, you either hug one side of the road or the other, but the driver of a motor car when he comes to the corner suddenly changes from the right portion of the road he is on to the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0634"/>
<col>1255</col>
wrong one, in order that he may be able to turn the corner without any sensible slackening of speed. I am afraid I have described this man&#x0153;uvre rather badly, but I have no doubt that noble Lords will be able to follow it. With regard to the public roads, which are the thoroughfares for the motor cars of this country and where motor cars are constantly going in one long steady stream, the first thing that the general public in these counties desire is that public money, no matter from what source it comes, shall be spent and given&#x2014;a rather bold demand at this time of day&#x2014;to the ratepayers and to the county councils to make up for the terrible amount of depreciation that has taken place in the roads during the last ten years. In a great many counties in England the highways are not only as bad as they were ten years ago, but many of them are a great deal worse. Just before the introduction of motor cars on a large scale, the main roads were never in a better state. The only people to whom the roads gave the slightest misgiving were the carriage builders in that a carriage with rubber tyres had a practically interminable life; but since motor cars were introduced the roads have become steadily worse, and in my own county, for instance, you can always notice this by seeing two ruts on each side of the crown of the road, with holes full of water in the other parts of the road.<lb/>
Let me tell His Majesty's Government that this is by no means a final settlement of the motor car question. In fact, this only covers a small portion of the fringe. I had the honour of entering the House of Commons at the same time as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd-George, and the only thing I ever heard him say or ever read in any of his speeches that gave me the slightest degree of satisfaction was in connection with that very interesting measure which he calls the Budget, in which he announced his intention of dealing in something like a comprehensive way with the question of motor cars. Let me also remind the motor car party&#x2014;I do wish my noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu were here&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<col>1256</col>
should have told him, but as Earl Russell represents the motor car party in this House I will tell him instead, that what has brought despair to agriculturists and a very great deal of melancholy and disappointment to holiday makers, has been the most marvellous piece of good fortune to the motor car makers in this country&#x2014;I refer to the wet summer we have had. If we had had anything like a dry summer there would have been the most formidable newspaper agitation ever known against motor cars&#x2014;something more irresistible even than the demand that women should have the vote and transcending the excitement about the Budget. The motor car question would have overshadowed everything if we had had a dry and dusty summer. I hope we shall get one for many reasons next summer, and unless something is done I can promise the noble Earl he will see some printed matter in <i>The Times</i> over my name.<lb/>
But, to be serious, there are other matters which require the attention of His Majesty's Government just as much as the light motor car. There is the alarming increase all over England of something like goods trains being dragged over the roads. It is almost impossible to go out for a ride or a drive in the country districts without meeting an enormous engine with two or three trucks behind, and probably followed by something more, making up the stock-in-trade of a travelling menagerie. They contribute practically nothing either to local or Imperial taxation. Those are the kind of nuisances which I hope His Majesty's Government will seriously consider, and which cause a very great deal of damage to the public roads. I agree with Earl Russell in thinking that a very great opportunity has been lost in which the whole of the motor car question might have been dealt with in a comprehensive manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03654"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is a very ambitious one. We have heard a great deal about motor roads, and that question is certainly one of the most important to be considered. But the Bill which we have before us is not content with making main roads for motor traffic; it intends to develop agriculture, to improve rural industry, to assist in scientific research, to aid in instruction in science, to extend small holdings, to assist forestry and the reclamation and drainage of land, harbours, in and navigation, and fisheries. Now the
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0635"/>
<col>1257</col>
proportion between means and ends to effect all this seems rather extreme; &#x00A3;500,000 is supposed to be all that is necessary for carrying out this gigantic scheme, but notwithstanding the disproportion between means and ends I think your Lordships' House, from the speeches that have been delivered, intend to give a very favourable reception to the Bill.<lb/>
I regret that a Liberal Government should have considered that there was so little space in this country for improving roads and doing all that is necessary for increasing agriculture that they should have in their original Bill&#x2014;I do not suppose it was intentional&#x2014;put in clauses which would very seriously have threatened open spaces and commons, which have been gained for the public by great exertions and by large sums of money given voluntarily. However, I am thankful to say that, owing to the pressure of the Open Spaces Association, clauses have been put in&#x2014;Clause 19 especially&#x2014;which more or less safeguard open spaces. But still they do not altogether meet the full desires of those who are interested in these open spaces, and I hope in the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House that where there is a possibility of still further safeguarding these most valuable portions of land steps will be taken to do so.<lb/>
It is rather extraordinary that there should have been three Bills brought in recently by His Majesty's Government which have threatened open spaces. One was an Irish Bill, the second the Housing and Town Planning Bill, and now we have the Development Bill. I am thankful to say that owing to representations alterations have been made in the first two of those Bills, and I do hope that in any other Bills that are introduced by His Majesty's Government thought will be taken in regard to this question, and that we shall not have again to bring pressure upon the Government to preserve open spaces, which are, after all, becoming every day a greater public necessity. The present Bill is an improvement in this respect especially as regards Part I, Clause 5, subclause (2), and in Part III, Clause 19, subclause (1). These clauses exempt open spaces from being taken possession of by His Majesty's Government; but there is still a great deal to be done before we can get that part of the Bill quite right. For instance, take rural commons. I do not
<col>1258</col>
see why rural commons are to be exempted from the operation of Clause 19. Rural commons apparently are not thought of sufficient importance that they should be prevented from being acquired compulsorily. Is this desirable? I do not think it is, and I trust your Lordships' House will do something to amend that part of the Bill. Now, in Part II, the exclusion of certain classes of land from the compulsory clauses appears to be limited to their not being appropriated to strips on either side of the proposed roads. This requires elucidation, and I ask the noble Earl who is in charge of the Bill whether this means that open spaces, gardens, &amp;c., can be compulsorily taken for the making of roads as long as they are not taken for the strips on either side? I hope it does not mean that, because I do not see in the least why that should be the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03655"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Earl's pardon. I do not quite follow him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03656"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: The point is this. In Part II apparently it is not permitted to acquire compulsorily strips of land by the side of the road, but as far as I can make out land for the road itself may be compulsorily taken away from open spaces. Now I come to the clause by which the Road Board may take 220 yards on each side of the proposed road. It also says that the Road Board shall be able to sell, lease, or manage this land. What is the object? We heard from the noble Earl that he did not want the landlords to benefit by being able to build their houses close to the road and get higher rents for them, but I think it has already been pointed out by some former speaker that, whatever might formerly have been an advantage in having your house on the front of a road, now every one is trying to get away from the main roads. If you motor through the country you will see that nearly every single house that is close to the road is to let. You may say that that is an argument in favour of the Government having it. I do not think that at all, and I do not see why the Government should take possession of more land than they require, especially to the extent of a quarter of a mile, or that they should have the power to sell, lease, or manage this land. Do they intend to be large landowners, because that it what it comes to if they are going to take a quarter of a mile of land along all the roads they make. They are going to be the largest
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0636"/>
<col>1259</col>
landowners in the country, and I do not see why Parliament should give them that power.<lb/>
Now to come to Part III. By Clause 19, I am thankful to say, we were able to a very large extent to safeguard our open spaces, but they are not safeguarded as we wish them to be. We were obliged to accept the conditions which were made, but we repudiated the idea altogether that we took them to be perfectly safeguarded. With regard to the schedule, it will be noticed that one arbitrator is to be appointed. Of course, every possible confidence can be placed in these gentlemen; but I ask, Is this desirable? For myself, I think it would be better if there were more than one. In the Schedule, Clause 1, subclause (<i>c</i>), it is provided that no additional allowance is to be made on account of the purchase of land being compulsory. The noble Earl in introducing the Bill said&#x2014;
<quote>"I need hardly say that no ten per cent. will be granted for compulsory purchase."</quote>
But he did not say why. I do not see in the least why ten per cent. should not be granted for compulsory purchase. Motor cars are to use the roads as well as carriages, and I ask, Is it therefore fair that no compensation should be given? We know the nuisance that motor cars are to those who live upon the roads, although they are very pleasant to those who are inside the cars. We know also that especially amongst poor people motor cars cause the greatest possible deprivation. To my mind I cannot say how much I admire the common people of this country who have only got one little garden and one little cottage; they cannot open their windows without dust flying in; everything they eat is filled with grit; their houses are dirty; their children cannot go to school without danger of being run over. And yet how law-abiding they are! I am perfectly lost in admiration of them. It seems to me very hard, taking into consideration that motor cars are to use these roads, that no compensation should be given for the compulsory purchase of land along the sides of the roads. There is another point in the Schedule. It says that portions of dwellings may be taken. It seems to be very hard that half a man's house should be taken away from him and the other half left him. I know it is said that they are to consider the amenity,
<col>1260</col>
but still there might be circumstances where a certain portion of a tolerably large house might be taken away, and if a certain strip of land was lying between that and the other half of the house it might be thought that there was no need for compensation. It would be very hard lines indeed for the person who owned that house to have a portion of his house taken away.<lb/>
Now, to come to a larger question. Under this Bill Parliament is to be ignored. The word "Parliament" occurs in Clause 2, subclauses (4) and (5), and in Clause 4, subclause (6). In no other part of the Bill does the word Parliament appear at all, and even in those clauses where the word comes in it simply deals with the placing of the Report on the Table of Parliament from the Auditor-General. The word "Parliament" certainly also appears in Clause 19, but that was introduced at the instance of the Open Spaces Association which I have already alluded to. Parliament as a whole is to be absolutely ignored. The noble Earl who introduced the Bill spoke about the horrors of bureaucracy. I am not going to dilate upon the horrors of bureaucracy although I could do so. He also told us that we were to trust to the commonsense and the sense of duty of those who would have to carry out the Act. I agree with him, and I certainly would give them every credit first for having commonsense and for having a perfect sense of duty; but I may point out to the noble Earl that the Development Commissioners might well consider it their duty to raise funds for development for public purposes under this Bill, and that there would be no question of their not having a sense of duty. They might consider it their duty to get possession of all this land in order to assist in the development of these public works.<lb/>
There remains lastly the broad question, Ought the Treasury to be permitted, without the approval of Parliament, to make grants from public funds? It is an entirely new departure, as far as I know, in Parliamentary procedure, that the Treasury without the sanction of Parliament, should make these grants, except, of course, such sanction as will be given if this Bill be passed. Ought the Treasury to be permitted to carry out great public works without having to come to Parliament for approval? That is the principle
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0637"/>
<col>1261</col>
which is going to be established if this Bill be passed and becomes an Act, and I think Parliament ought to consider it most carefully before giving sanction to such a new development.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03657"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHCOMBE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not going to follow noble Lords on the various philanthropic features of this Bill if it becomes an Act, but I would like to say something in support of what has been said by a noble Lord on this side of the House, Lord Barnard, as to the needs of the agricultural colleges. The noble Lord is interested in a large college in the North. It is my fate to be interested in a college in the South-east of England. It was founded by the County Councils of Kent and Surrey, and to a certain extent has been assisted by the Government; but the council of that college are not yet satisfied that they have had from the Government the support they should receive, and I hope if the happy day comes when this Bill passes that funds will be at the disposal of the noble Earl as President of the Board of Agriculture to assist the wants of this college. I need not speak of the increasing demands that agriculture is making and the great amount of science that is required for its development, or mention the fact that the appliances of an agricultural college are different from what they were twenty years ago. I believe the noble Earl is well aware of the college I am referring to, and he has had many demands for increased subsidies from those who are interested in it. Unfortunately, he has not yet seen his way to visit the college, although we hope to see him there some day. Urgent reasons have hitherto prevented him attending, although policy may have been connected with his absence, and he might have thought that he would have been overcome by the demands made upon him if he had shown his face there. I would appeal, however, to the noble Earl whenever he has an opportunity not to forget Wye College.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03658"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think this Bill is a remarkable instance of the way in which measures may come to your Lordships' House in a very different form from that in which they were originally introduced in the House of Commons. One would naturally have supposed that a Bill of this importance and magnitude would have received the most careful and
<col>1262</col>
mature consideration at the hands of His Majesty's Government before it was introduced; but it is quite clear, I think, from the shape in which the Bill comes to your Lordships that His Majesty's Government found that the form in which it was originally cast was one which would not be acceptable to either House of Parliament.<lb/>
What does this Bill do that could not be done before? There is only one small portion of the Bill to which I attach any great importance, and that portion is one which I do not suppose that your Lordships will attempt to amend. It is sub-clause (2) of Clause 2&#x2014;
<quote>"There shall be charged on and issued out of the Consolidated Fund, or the growing produce thereof, in the year ending the 31st day of March, nineteen hundred and eleven, and in each of the next succeeding four years, the sum of five hundred thousand pounds."</quote>
All the rest of the Bill, or nearly all the rest of the Bill, makes provision for that which can already be done. The real fact of the matter is that if at any time His Majesty's Government had chosen to give money for the purposes of this Bill there are ample powers in existing Statutes to do so. If your Lordships will look at the Act which constituted the Board of Agriculture you will find that provision is there made for aiding any school, for aiding instruction, lectures, experiments, and research, and the collection of information for promoting agriculture or forestry. All these things can be done now. All that is wanted is the money. That is the one thing which has been lacking in order to do that which this Bill now proposes to do.<lb/>
There is one change which, however, is not a change of the Government's own making, but to my mind it is a change of very great importance in the Bill as we have it now, as compared with what it was when it was introduced. That is that the first object in the first clause is now the promotion of agriculture. I think it was my noble friend Lord Barnard who asked the noble Earl who introduced the Bill whether he could give any guarantee that agriculture would receive sufficient consideration at the hands of the Government. I hope that the noble Earl will be able to answer that, specifically and not generally. The noble Earl very often
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0638"/>
<col>1263</col>
in this House says, "The object is one which has my deepest sympathy and I trust the Government may see their way to give the assurance asked for"; but then there is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the noble Earl, as we know in other branches of administration, is constantly, if I may use a hunting expression, headed off by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I notice that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in speaking upon this Bill in another place, said&#x2014;
<quote>"We propose a grant for the purpose of doing that class of work largely done by the great landowners themselves in relation to agricultural development, and this will come to at least a quarter of a million a year."</quote>
Will the noble Earl say that that pledge is going to be fulfilled, and that a quarter of a million a year will be earmarked for this purpose? I venture to say that if it is not so the agricultural community will be very greatly and legitimately disappointed after the promise made by His Majesty's Government in another place.<lb/>
I notice that amongst other things for which the Bill is to provide is to be the promotion of small holdings. A clause has been put in which has been referred to already by one noble Lord to-night providing that no advances shall be made for the purposes of small holdings except on the lines of the Act which passed your Lordships' House only two years ago. I ask the noble Earl this question &#x2014;I have asked him before and I ask him again, and perhaps I may get an answer this time&#x2014;What has he done with the Small Holdings Fund? When the noble Earl introduced the Small Holdings Bill he told us that the Treasury were going to place at his disposal &#x00A3;100,000 a year for small holdings. How much of that has been spent? He has had &#x00A3;100,000 for three years, so that is &#x00A3;300,000. How much has been expended? We hoped that the noble Earl would have instituted some model small holdings to show us how small holdings may most economically and satisfactorily be managed in this country. We wanted him to take not a very good piece of land, but a moderate piece of land, and put on it a moderate man, situated at a moderate distance from the great markets, and show us if he could make a moderate profit. The noble Earl has got the power to do it now,
<col>1264</col>
and I venture to say this Bill is not in any way necessary to enable him to carry this into effect.<lb/>
I confess I am sorry to see no provision in the Bill for earmarking any portion of this fund for any particular purpose. I should have been quite satisfied if it had been divided between England, Ireland, and Scotland, in such proportions as the Government might have thought fit. But I confess, notwithstanding the appointment of these Commissioners, I look with some fear and trepidation on the ultimate veto of the Treasury, and I still foresee that dangers may arise. The moment might come when the Commissioners might make a recommendation to the effect that a considerable sum of money should be spent in the promotion of agricultural objects, and the Treasury might think it would be very inadvisable in the then state of political affairs to give sanction to the proposal of the Commissioners in this direction. On the other hand, they might be told that there was the draining of the Barrow and the Bann which was a matter of much greater importance, and that in view of an important division likely to take place in a few days time it would be better to devote the money to that process. I would like to see something in the Bill to obviate any possibility of that. I have had some experience, as has the noble Earl, of what happens in the Colonies, and I know quite well the demands which arise for the construction of works in certain constituencies just before a General Election.<lb/>
Then I do not see any definite relation between the Commissioners and the local authorities. I cannot help thinking there ought to be something in the Bill showing quite clearly what will be the relation between local authorities who now spend money on many of these objects, not only on roads but on agricultural education as well. There is not a single word in the Bill as to how far the expenditure by a local authority is to be governed by the central authority, or <i>vice versa</i>. I certainly welcome one part of the Bill, and that is that part which provides for something being done to defray the cost of maintaining the roads of the country in a proper and efficient state of repair and fit for motor traffic. The noble Earl opposite (Earl Russell), who represents the motor interest in this House in the regrettable absence of
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0639"/>
<col>1265</col>
Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, is not wholly satisfied with the Bill, but, at any rate, perhaps he will allow me to say that speaking as a ratepayer, I do feel that the very heavy cost to which the county councils and highway authorities have been put in consequence of motor cars, not for the benefit of their own ratepayers but for the benefit of ratepayers living at a great distance away, is one which to some extent, at any rate&#x2014;I think to the whole extent&#x2014;ought to be borne by the taxpayers and not by the ratepayers of the country. The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, was very facetious and very amusing in his criticism of the objects and provisions of this Bill because they seemed to encourage motorists. He appeared to think that it would be much better that a motor car should run through a village and over a child rather than round a village and avoid running over the child. I cannot say that I sympathise greatly with the noble Lord in that view. But there is something more than that. The Duke of Northumberland lives near Brentford, and the noble Duke may know that the tramway traffic and ordinary traffic causes great inconvenience to His Majesty's lieges who make use of the High-street there. I think all of us who have to use that road would greatly rejoice to see a road taken round Brentford instead of having to go through it, and if that would be to the safety of the public I cannot imagine that any of your Lordships would seriously contest the advantage of such a proposition.<lb/>
I welcome this Bill. I think it may do a considerable amount of good, especially to the rural districts, but I venture to say that His Majesty's Government might have done a very great deal of what they are talking about very magniloquently in the country by the provisions already at their disposal in existing Acts of Parliament. I am not going into the financial question whether we can afford to have motor roads, and improved roads, and all the other things proposed in this Bill, as well as Dreadnoughts and old age pensions. That is a matter for His Majesty's Government. They are plunging into these things with what I think is a considerable amount of recklessness; but that is their affair, and if they see the r way to provide the money no doubt an opportunity will be afforded to your Lordships for giving your consent to the means proposed for raising the necessary funds in due course. As I say, I do not profess to offer
<col>1266</col>
any observations on that portion of the Bill. But I hope you will give it a Second Reading, and that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will take care that a very considerable portion of this money is devoted to agricultural purposes and not allowed to be deflected to any other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03659"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just sat down said in the beginning of his speech that the Bill was considerably different from what it was when originally introduced into the House of Commons. That is tolerably self-evident; but I think my noble friend would have found it unnecessary to make that remark if he had not failed to listen attentively to the speech with which the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture introduced the Bill. We are always glad when the noble Earl rises to make a speech, because intermingled with the instruction he is good enough to give us there is always a slight vein of humour which amuses and interests the House; at all events, it does me.<lb/>
The account of the genesis of this Bill which the noble Earl gave your Lordships was somewhat peculiar. He described how this Bill, when originally introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was such that t would have produced a general scramble for money. He said that, thanks to Lord Robert Cecil and Mr. Rufus Isaacs, His Majesty's Government came to observe that that would be the case, and they therefore proceeded to change it. This is not the only Bill which His Majesty's Government have dealt with in that way. I have no doubt your Lordships know to what I allude; but at the same time it is by no means certain that this scramble is not going to take place now. Indeed, attempts have already been made to start it. The Scottish people have put in their claim, and have said, "Divide this up, and let us know how much we are going to get." And the Irish&#x2014;well, we know they can always get a lot, and it was quite unnecessary for them to make a similar demand. But His Majesty's Government objected strongly to anything which approached a definite statement. As the noble Earl, Lord Onslow said, &#x00A3;250,000 is to be devoted to agriculture. Well, does English agriculture think it gets its fair proportion in that, or does Scottish agriculture think the same, and will the noble Earl the Leader of the House give us any definite informa-
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0640"/>
<col>1267</col>
tion as to the amount of money which is going to be expended under this Bill?<lb/>
The Bill is full of general assertions which really, when they are looked at, come to nothing. For instance, in Clause 1 it says&#x2014;
<quote>"and for any other purpose calculated to promote the economic development of the United Kingdom."</quote>
Well, "economic" is a blessed word, like Mesopotamia. It may mean anything or everything or nothing. Then you come to Clause 5, which is a sop to the agricultural labourer, or intended to be so. It says first of all that they are not to take this, that, and the other land, and it goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"and shall also as far as practicable avoid displacing any considerable number of agricultural labourers or others employed on or about the land."</quote>
Take, for instance, that somewhat ambitious scheme, the greater part of which has been dropped, about new roads, and this idea of taking 220 yards on each side of the road. How could they take quantities of land like that without displacing agricultural labourers? I know it says "as far as practicable," but that means you reduce your statement to absolute indefiniteness. Just in the same way Clause 18, on which some comment has been made says&#x2014;
<quote>"In approving, executing, or making advances in respect of the execution of any work under this Act involving the employment of labour on a considerable scale, regard shall be had, so far as is reasonably practicable, to the general state and prospects of employment."</quote>
Why? I presume the unemployment will be chiefly found in the towns. Is the noble Earl going to make these new roads by employing persons who are out o employment in the big towns? If it does not mean something of that sort, what does it mean? This is stuffing, padding, put in with no particular meaning, and I do not think that the unemployed or anybody else would be any the worse off if that clause Were left out.<lb/>
Now let me proceed to a more definite point, and that is with regard to the manner in which it is proposed to take land under this Bill. The manner in which it is to be taken and purchased is new. I am glad to see from the schedule that the course which is to be pursued when land is taken
<col>1268</col>
is quite different from my noble friend's beloved schedule in his still more beloved Small Holdings Act. As this Bill started, his schedule was there, with all the prohibitions of expert witnesses and all the rest of it. That schedule has been struck out. Why? I believe, although I am not certain, that it was done either on Report or in Standing Committee. I believe it was put in on the motion of the Government by the Solicitor-General, but, at all events, this schedule is far better and more just, and a wiser schedule than the one which is always quoted to us for our acceptance, and which was endeavoured to be thrust down our throats the other day with regard to the Housing Bill. But not only that, this new Department&#x2014;these Development Commissioners&#x2014;who are empowered to take land&#x2014;before long every Department will have power to take land&#x2014;are entrusted with powers which I think were not even proposed for the Local Government Board. These Commissioners can simply make an order without any procedure, without giving notice of the sale, just simply at their own free will. That, at all events, is what is intended in the Bill. In the schedule of the noble Earl in regard to taking land under the Small Holdings Act certain notices and so on were to be given; but here there is not one word about procedure of any sort or kind. If your Lordships will look through the Bill perhaps some of you can find a thing which I cannot find, and that is where power is given to the Development Commissioners to make an order. I do not think it is in the Bill. I have asked one or two people who ought to understand these things to find it for me. We all thought it must be there, but at all events we were not able to find it. You will find plenty of what is to be done when they are applying for an order, and what is to be done when they get an order, but as to making an order they seem to have omitted giving the Commissioners any power.<lb/>
With regard to Clause 19, when you come to deal with commons you deal with them in an entirely different way from what you do when you take anybody else's property. You say that when it is a question of touching a common you must have a Provisional Order. I thought that was <i>anathema maranatha</i> to His Majesty's Government. Why do you want this expensive and troublesome way of doing things? The object of everything with
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0641"/>
<col>1269</col>
this Government is cheapness. Justice is a secondary consideration. The great thing with them is that provided a thing is cheap and costs little, that is the way to proceed, and that is the course which they are endeavouring as far as possible to pursue. At any rate, if His Majesty's Government have not much regard for the property of private people, I am glad to see they have some regard for the commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03660"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to present some points affecting the position of local authorities, especially county councils, to which I think attention should be called in Committee. I am not at all satisfied that in Clause 4 as it stands adequate protection is afforded to local authorities from having schemes imposed upon them which will lead to expenditure on the roads without their consent. I think if anything is to be put forward which means a permanent charge on any locality, that locality ought to have an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon it before it is adopted. I think that Part II of the Bill, after what we have heard to-night, is likely to be very materially altered before the Bill leaves your Lordships' House; but Clause 11, providing for these great roads of magnificent widths, is likely to break down of its own weight. The width proposed of 220 yards on each side from the centre of the road would mean that every eleven yards of road would involve the taking of an acre of ground, or 160 acres to every mile of road; whereas a light railway, as I am informed, can be made on four or five acres, representing, say, a fortieth part of the same area. But I think it is very important that where advantage is taken of the provision by the Road Board or the Development Commissioners to make advances to county councils or others for the improvement of roads, they should be empowered also to contribute towards the maintenance of existing roads. A very large part of the improvements made might consist of the widening of the roads, and if you add eight feet to a road which is already sixteen feet wide, you increase the cost of maintenance by fifty per cent., and if that is done for the benefit of the public generally rather than the locality it is only fair, I think, that it should be permissible, at any rate, to the Road Board to make contributions to the maintenance. Then there are words in Clause 19 which I think may be found
<col>1270</col>
of very great practical inconvenience in dealing with commons. It says there need be no Provisional Order where there is provision made&#x2014;
<quote>"for giving in exchange for such land other land, not being less in area, certified by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to be equally advantageous to the persons, if any, entitled to commonable or other rights, and to the public."</quote>
I know a good many commons a mile or more from a village, and land near a village of better quality is of much greater advantage to the people than worse land at a distance, and I think the words, "not being less in area" might oblige people who tried to effect an exchange to go to all sorts of expedients to get an exactly equal area, which might involve very great practical inconvenience in carrying the thing out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03661"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not intended to make any observations at this stage of the Bill, but my noble friend Lord Onslow appealed to me so very directly to support this Bill in consideration of the advantage I should get by a road round Brentford that I cannot help saying a word. If the noble Earl thinks that this is one of those baits which he says are so often held forth in the Colonies before an election, then noble Lords opposite will not get my vote by engaging in any such undertaking as that, because it seems to me that these are just the cases where this Bill will be absolutely useless. The only way in which a road might be made round Brentford, or round places of the same kind, is at enormous expense, and the only way in which the Government could face that expense is by taking 220 yards on either side of the roads. I want to know what the landowners in a district like that will think of having that amount of land taken from them which they may hope will develop, if, indeed, the development of land is ever justified in these days. Noble Lords opposite sometimes seem to think it is not, but if it is at all legitimate for a landlord to look forward to the development of his land, and if 220 yards on each side is taken from him compulsorily for such a purpose as this, I cannot see how it is to be carried out. Therefore the provisions of the Bill seem to be perfectly useless in such a case. I cannot myself see what is to be done with these new roads in other parts of the country. It does not seem to me that we want new roads in this country. What we do want is improvement of our
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0642"/>
<col>1271</col>
existing roads. I cannot look forward to the multiplication of roads for the purpose of facilitating the operations of motorists as being a thing which in itself is very worthy of the consideration of Parliament. I confess I cannot join in the chorus of approbation&#x2014;I must say it is about the only bit of approbation the noble Earl has received&#x2014;which he has received from some quarters of the House in favour of his scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03662"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend beside me (Lord Salisbury) has explained so clearly the attitude which we desire to maintain in in regard to this Bill that I need add very little to what he has said. At any rate I shall endeavour to say nothing which might be out of harmony with the note of good humour struck by the noble Earl the President of Board of Agriculture at the outset of this discussion and maintained throughout its course. If there has been an occasional attempt made to criticise the proposals of His Majesty's Government, or to regard them with a certain degree of suspicion, it is largely the fault of His Majesty's Government themselves, or, at any rate, the fault of those who are in the habit of acting with them. For we have seen this Bill recommended to the country upon very different grounds and in very different tones from those used by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill this evening.<lb/>
The noble Earl gave us an explanation of the origin of the Bill which struck some of us with considerable amazement. He produced from the official box at his side&#x2014;I am not sure that the document was not eventually found elsewhere&#x2014;and read to the House with great gusto a statement from which we were led to suppose that the opinion, at any rate of one of the colleagues of the noble Earl's, is that this Bill is really a measure for the relief of the great landlords, and in support of that statement he called attention to the fact that in Clause 1 the first place is given to the promotion of agriculture. May I be permitted to remind the noble Earl, however, that the first place was not always given to agriculture? In the original version of the Bill agriculture only ran second; and it was the friends of agriculture who succeeded in promoting it to the prominent place it now occupies.<lb/>
I am ready to believe that the intention of this Bill is to afford more liberal treat-
<col>1272</col>
ment to certain somewhat neglected enterprises, and to do so in a more systematic manner than heretofore. If, however, that is all that it is intended to do, I do not quite understand why it is necessary to construct all the ponderous machiney by which the Bill is to be carried out. I say ponderous, but I am careful not to say expensive, machinery, because we gather that the official part of the machine is to be run on the cheap. The remuneration of the Commissioners&#x2014;the official machinery&#x2014;amounts to only &#x00A3;3,000 a year. But of a total of five Commissioners three are to receive no salary at all. I think it is time to ask ourselves whether we really can rely upon securing the services of gentlemen who will possess all the conspicuous qualities which the noble Earl imputed in advance to the new Commissioners and will consent to place those qualities at the disposal of the public without any remuneration at all. I believe it was a kinsman of the noble Marquess beside me (Lord Salisbury) who once observed that to make a project of this kind work successfully you require to discover a "laborious archangel with private means" who will take charge of it. That really is not an inapt description of the kind of man whose unpaid services you are endeavouring to secure for the purposes of this Bill.<lb/>
Then is it not the case, as was said by my noble friend the Lord Chairman, that nearly every one of the objects which are enumerated in the first clause of the Bill are objects which can now be accomplished by the action of existing Departments, which are, in fact, accomplished by the action of these Departments, and that they are objects for which at the present time the Treasury can, if it likes, grant sums of money, and with regard to which the Government of the day can, if it likes, secure expert advice by whatever means is pleases? I am therefore rather at a loss to understand why this machinery is to be set up. But I am bound to admit that the Bill seems to me much less open to criticism than it was when it first made its appearance in public. I note in particular the disappearance of that flagitious proposal that the Old Sinking Fund should be diverted for the purposes of this Bill. It would no longer be true of the Bill to say, as was said in the explanatory Memorandum which at first accompanied it, that is enables the Treasury to make free grants
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0643"/>
<col>1273</col>
and loans at its own discretion. But the scope of the Bill nevertheless remains enormously wide. I will not again go through the different subjects enumerated in the first clause of the Bill. It is no exaggeration to say that there is literally no enterprise, however remotely connected with the industrial life of this country, that cannot be taken up under the wording of the Bill as it now stands.<lb/>
The financial limits of the Bill are equally wide. The only limit I can discover is the limit of half a million to be drawn from the Consolidated Fund. There is no reason why unlimited grants should not be taken under appropriation Acts for any of the purposes of the Bill. Unless the expectations held out by His Majesty's Ministers are to be entirely falsified this Bill must impose an enormous burden on the public. I have an uneasy suspicion that the real object of this new departure is to withdraw that large expenditure from the cognisance and control of Parliament, and I cannot help hoping that it may be possible for us in Committee to suggest some means whereby that control shall be effectually exercised. Such a safeguard appears to me absolutely necessary if the Departments concerned are to be protected from the constant pressure which will beyond all doubt be put upon them for grants from these new funds. It was quite clear from the tone of the noble Earl's observations and his reference to his own experience in a great colony that he was well aware of the extent and the gravity of this danger.<lb/>
I will not at this hour enter into details with regard to Part I of the Bill, but I should like to say one word only with regard to that part of it which deals with the question of road making. Here, again undoubtedly the Bill has been greatly modified, and, to my mind, greatly improved. It is a much less ambitious project than it was when first introduced, and I hope that we may succeed in Committee in rendering it a little less ambitious still. On that point I will not attempt to improve on the statement made by the noble Lord who spoke just now. I cannot see why it should be necessary that these Road Commissioners whenever they want to make a new road should take up a strip on each side of it which, as the noble Lord told the House, would work out at the rate of 150 or 160 acres per mile. My

suspicions with regard to this point are greatly increased when I find that under Clause 11 of the Bill the Road Board are to have power not only to acquire this land but to sell it, lease it, and manage it. That seems to open up a prospect of a new public Department owning enormous tracts of country in different parts of the United Kingdom, and entrusted with the task&#x2014;for which I do not think they will be particularly well qualified&#x2014;of managing those tracts as owners.<lb/>
In view of the very considerable reduction in the powers and responsibilities of the Road Board, I cannot help feeling a doubt whether it really is necessary to insist upon the maintenance of the Board as an organisation distinct from the Development Commissioners. Let us not forget that the Development Commissioners are to be men not only of high character and great ability, but that they must be most versatile people. They have to deal with agriculture, forestry, rural transport, harbours, inland navigation, fisheries, and any other matters concerning the economic development of the United Kingdom. If these gentlemen have these versatile powers, is there anything very improper in suggesting that they should also assume charge of the roads? I cannot see what argument there is against it. Surely there is more difference between harbours and small holdings, or forestry and fisheries&#x2014;of all of which the Development Commissioners are to have charge&#x2014;than between the roads, which are given to the Road Board, and rural transport, which is given to the Development Commissioners. I trust that when we arrive at the Committee stage we shall be able to induce His Majesty's Government to consider whether there is not a case for simplifying and rendering more economical the machinery of the Bill at these points.<lb/>
There is only one other matter in the Bill about which I wish to say a word. I think your Lordships will have to consider in Committee whether it is not absolutely necessary that the wording of Clause 18, which deals with unemployment, should be considerably modified. I heard&#x2014;I think we must all have heard&#x2014;with satisfaction the noble Earl's explicit statement that he did not intend this to be a Relief of Distress Bill or anything of that kind. [EARL CARRINGTON: Hear

<col>1275</col>
hear.] Having heard that statement from his lips we are entitled to ask him whether he will not see to it that the clause agrees with the speech he made this evening, because it seems to me perfectly clear that the clause as now drawn is one which would render it possible for those who have the interpretation of this measure to use it for the express purpose of undertaking relief works which are not desirable on their own merits. This is not a vain imagination on my part, because the Bill has been read outside the walls of Parliament very much as I suggest that it may be read. Mr. Keir Hardie the other day said that the Labour Party had claimed work or maintenance. He proceeded
<quote>"state insurance against unemployment took the place of the demand for maintenance. The Development Bill, which he regarded as the most revolutionary measure ever introduced into Parliament, would meet in large measure the second of their schemes."</quote>
That is how the Bill is interpreted by gentlemen who think with Mr. Keir Hardie. But it is not only Mr. Keir Hardie who holds that opinion. Here is a statement made by a distinguished colleague of the noble Earl's&#x2014;the President of the Board of Trade. He said on September 5&#x2014;
<quote>"In connection with unemployment I must direct your attention to the Development Bill which is now before Parliament."</quote>
The object of this Bill, he said, was to provide a fund for certain works, and then he proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"I should like to draw your attention to a very important clause in that Bill, which says that the prosecution of these works shall be regulated, as far as possible, by the conditions of the labour market, so that in every bad year of unemployment they can be expanded so as to increase the demand for labour at times of exceptional slackness."</quote>
That seems to indicate clearly an intention on the part of a section at any rate of the Cabinet to use this Bill for the purpose of creating work which otherwise would not be created, of undertaking enterprises which otherwise would not be undertaken on their merits, for the simple purpose of relieving unemployment. I earnestly trust that His Majesty's Government will once for all dismiss from their minds any idea of the kind. May I at the risk of wearying your Lordships read one sentence from the recent Report of the Royal Commission
<col>1276</col>
on the Poor Laws dealing with this matter? They say&#x2014;
<quote>"We have now shown that municipal relief-works have not assisted but rather prejudiced the better class of workmen they were intended to help. On the other hand they have encouraged the casual labourers, by giving them a further supply of that casual work which is so dear to their hearts and so demoralising to their character. They have encouraged and not helped the incapables; they have discouraged and not helped the capables. Moreover, the provision of artificial work for unskilled labourers in particular localities can only tend to fix in such localities these agglomerations of unskilled labour, to disperse which is one of the solutions of local unemployment."</quote>
Those are weighty words, and I trust that His Majesty's Government will lay them to heart and will take care that nothing is allowed to find its way into this Bill which is inconsistent with the wise policy thus described.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03663"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to be allowed to say a few words in closing this discussion. I am grateful to the noble Marquess opposite and to the other noble Lords who have spoken for what the noble Marquess called the very good-humoured reception of this Bill. The noble Marquess said I gave the impression that this Bill was intended to be a Bill for the relief of great landlords. The policy of His Majesty's Government when it came in with the enormous majority that it now possesses in the House of Commons was to do jutsice not to one class only, but to do justice all round. There is no intention merely to give relief to great landlords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03664"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Why great?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03665"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The object is to give relief to agriculture generally. The noble Marquess thought the sum of &#x00A3;3,000 a year was not enough for the two salaried Commissioners and that there might be difficulty in getting men who would volunteer to undertake the duties of the position. That is not the view of His Majesty's Government. They hope to obtain first-rate men to act in this capacity. A request was made earlier in the evening that the names of these Commissioners should be at once laid before the House. I quite see the force of that. I am naturally unable to-night to give even the faintest suspicion of the names of these gentlemen,
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0645"/>
<col>1277</col>
but I will lay the request which has been made before the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I promise that all I can do will be done to meet the wishes of noble Lords opposite. In regard to the demands of the different Departments, to which the noble Marquess referred, I thought I had explained that. As it is now, there is a sort of competition amongst different Departments. They rather vie with each other, and if any money is supposed to be available one Department tries against the other to get it from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. According to this plan I think there will be a great improvement, because all these demands will be carefully considered on their merits and the most important will be taken first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03666"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: May I ask whether there is any hope that the promise of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a quarter of a million will be devoted to agriculture will be fulfilled?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03667"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I will come to that. Then the noble Marquess spoke about there being no limit to the enormous burden that might be laid on the public. I was sorry to hear that he thought there might be some intention to withdraw the expenditure from the cognisance of Parliament. I can assure the noble Marquess that there is no intention of any sort to do that. The simple object of taking the money from the Consolidated Fund is that when you get these laborious archangels, as I think the noble Marquess called them, it would be only fair to them to let them know what they have got to spend. It would be hard if they were left absolutely at the mercy of an annual vote from the House of Commons It is almost too small a grant to give them, but we thought it desirable that they should know how much there is to spend so that they could shape their course accordingly. In regard to the strip of land on each side of new roads, about which we have heard so much, that would only be taken in certain cases. When Imperial money is expended there should be an Imperial return for it. We do not propose to spend a large sum of money out of the public exchequer and then for some landlord to step in and reap the benefits. The noble Duke opposite was terrified at the idea that this large strip of land should be taken through Brentford. But any Commis-

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03668"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: As I understand it, the noble Earl says there is not much money and therefore this land on the side of the road must be obtained so that the Government may recoup themselves. How are the Government going to recoup themselves?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03669"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: One noble Lord said that a highway driven through agricultural property would decrease its value. I do not see that it would. It cannot be denied that the construction of a new road would enormously increase the value even of agricultural land, and the Government should get the betterment instead of its going into the pockets of private landlords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03670"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: It cannot do that under the Schedule.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03671"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I do not quite follow the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03672"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: There is a provision in the Schedule empowering the compulsory acquisition of land by which it is enacted that&#x2014;
<quote>"the arbitrator shall have regard to the extent to which the remaining and contiguous lands and hereditaments belonging to the same proprietor may be benefited by the proposed work or road for which the land is authorised to be acquired by the undertakers."</quote>
A landlord will not be able to exact very much from the Government if he is benefited by the road.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03673"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: A very good suggestion was made by my noble friend behind me&#x2014;namely, that a road should be driven through this strip to develop the hinterland belonging to the landed proprietor, who would in that case have a legitimate advantage from the improvement brought about by Imperial funds. The noble Marquess rather cavilled at the idea that the Road Board should be an organisation distinct from the Development Commissioners. I think there are two very good reasons for that. In the first place, as we have heard to-night, there are a great many interests involved and there may be great difficulty in getting all these interests properly represented. There is this other
<image src="S5LV0003P0I0646"/>
<col>1279</col>
very good reason, that the Development Commissioners, as noble Lords well know, will not be an administrative body at all while the Road Board will; so that there is a perfectly distinct duty and obligation on the two bodies. Attention has been called to Clause 18 and suggestions made that it should be modified. I need not enter into that at this late hour; but nobody in any way wishes this to be a Relief Bill or a Right to Work Bill. Mr. Keir Hardie has been quoted as having said that this Bill was revolutionary. But "revolution" is such a curious word; it has a different meaning in many people's minds; and I remember Mr. Keir Hardie to have said in the Standing Committee that he did not in any shape or way look upon this Bill as in any sense a Right to Work Bill, or upon Clause 18 as being for the relief of unemployment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03674"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: What about Mr. Winston Churchill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03675"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Oh, please! There have been a great many criticisms on the Bill. I hope the House will not think me discourteous if at this late hour I do not go through them chapter and verse. But I will take the principal ones. Lord Camperdown spoke about the possible scramble. I believe Mr. Chaplin introduced the idea that there should be eighty per cent. of the money given to England, eleven per cent. to Scotland, and nine per cent. to Ireland. But I think the House will see at once that any idea of that sort would defeat the objects of the Bill, because supposing there was a large scheme of afforestation in Scotland and Scotland only received eleven per cent. of the total grant, the scheme would break down and the Bill would not have the useful purpose which is hoped for it. The noble Earl the Chairman of Committees feared that there would not be enough money spent on agriculture. Of course that is a very natural fear on the part of one who has occupied the position which I now have the honour to fill; but my right hon. friend stated in the House of Commons that he was prepared to give a quarter of a million of money to that object. A quarter of a million is a good increase on what we get now, and with that money we shall be able to get the horse scheme through and the various other matters which ought to be

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03676"><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member><membercontribution>: Do I understand from the noble Earl that the Government undertake that a quarter of a million will be given to agriculture?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0003P0-03677"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My right hon. friend has said that he is going to give a quarter of a million, and there is nothing which he has said either in the House of Commons or elsewhere that he has any desire to retract. What he has said he has said, and I quite believe I shall get the money. Then as regards experimental small holdings, we have gone beyond that. They are not experimental. They are an actual fact. It is no use experimenting to know whether small holdings will pay or not when applications are coming in at the rate of 1,000 acres a week. The child has grown into a healthy man, and I dismiss that altogether. Then I was sorry to hear about Irish drainage being regarded as a bribe to the Irish. I am quite certain that there will be no bribe or any hanky-panky of that sort. Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, who is ill, has written to say that he had intended to have spoken on behalf of this measure. He adds&#x2014;
<quote>"I think it is a useful Bill, and I should like to have supported it on behalf of motorists in general."</quote>
That is very satisfactory. Lord Barnard spoke about agricultural colleges requiring more assistance. They come under the first clause as bodies that are not working for profit, and I can assure the noble Lord that I will do everything that is possible to support the must claims of agricultural colleges to financial aid. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Meath, was not satisfied with Clause 18 and spoke about altering the clause which relates to commons Lord Willoughby de Broke gave us a most interesting speech. I can assure him that the highway authorities are, after all, composed of people possessing a certain amount of commonsense, and they will not drive roads through allotments and through farmyards. I daresay the noble Lord, who is fond of hunting, has an intense horror of roads and motors.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0003P0-03679"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl behind me, Earl Russell, talked about the peddling improvements we propose to make; but I would point out that the rounding off of these corners, of which the noble Earl spoke, are matters of immense importance, and might, for instance, have saved the valuable life of Lord de Clifford, who risked and gave his own life to save those of his fellow creatures. Some noble Lords complain that we are doing too much, and the noble Earl behind me says we are doing too little. The noble Marquess on the Front Bench opposite, Lord Salisbury, in asking who were to be the Commissioners, said that suitable men would not be easy to find. With that I quite agree, but we must hope for the best. In regard to the request which has been made for information as to what schemes the Government have decided to be necessary, I think that if we had any idea of the schemes which ought to be undertaken at once we would be blameworthy if we made an immediate announcement on the subject, because such an announcement would be a direct incentive to an open scramble to participate in the funds. Then the noble Marquess asks as to the amount which the Government contemplate spending at once. I would point out that the amount of money to be appropriated under the Bill is limited. Within that limit I suppose we should spend as much as the Commissioners thought right and as much more as Parliament in its wisdom might think fit to grant in future. I think I have briefly gone through most of the objections, and have tried to answer them to the best of my ability. I can only once more very respectfully thank the House for the reception which has been given to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I think something like &#x00A3;6,000 has been spent out of that grant. I do not see why because a Minister has money to spend it should be spent if it is not wanted.
