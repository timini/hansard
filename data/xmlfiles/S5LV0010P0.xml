<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00117"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I purpose submitting a Motion that the House should adjourn from to-day until next Tuesday. I am given to understand; that that will be the arrangement most convenient to most of the members of your Lordships' House. The business for next week will begin on Tuesday with the Committee Stage of the Maritime Conventions Bill. That, ought not and probably will not take very long, and I shall be glad if we can, on Tuesday, follow that with a much more difficult measure, the Copy right Bill, of which I hope we shall obtain the Second Reading on Tuesday if we have time. Then there are three Bills which were held over when the House rose in addition to the Copyright Bill, namely, the Education (Administrative Provisions) Bill, the Pacific Cable Bill, and the Telegraph (Construction) Bill. Those I shall propose to take as early as the convenience of the House will permit.<lb/>
We have unfortunately lost since we last assembled two members of your Lordships' House, to whom the House as a whole&#x2014;both sides of it&#x2014;was greatly attached from long experience of their conduct in this House and out of it&#x2014;Lord James of Hereford and Lord Onslow. But I think it will be in accord with the feelings of the House if we say what ought to be said, and must be said, about two men so distinguished in our proceedings when public business begins next Tuesday.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MOROCCO.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00118"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships are aware that very important discussions and negotiations have been going on for some time between the Great Powers, France and Germany, with respect to Morocco, and in relation thereto we appear from time to time to have been very deeply interested. We are all glad that a settlement has been arrived at. I hope it has been arrived at definitely on all points connected with those negotiations between the two principal Powers; but I think it would be interesting and of use if your Lordships had an opportunity, with the information which probably could be given to us by His Majesty's Government, to consider, and perhaps to review, the transactions which have taken place, and especially our situation in regard to those negotiations.
<col>6</col>
I therefore wish to ask my noble friend the Leader of the House whether an opportunity will soon be offered&#x2014;one understands it may not be immediately convenient to the House&#x2014;to consider the relation of this country to those important transactions and the nature of the transactions themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00119"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is nothing in the least unreasonable in my noble friend's Question. Last night in another place the Prime Minister told the House that there would be an occasion for discussing the transactions in connection with the Franco-German Agreement, in the case of Morocco. It is to everybody a matter of enormous satisfaction that those discussions at Berlin, upon which the eye of the world has been fixed for some time, have now at last come to a conclusion which it is hoped by those in authority both in Berlin and in Paris will be acceptable to the public in each country. My noble friend spoke of having a debate or discussion&#x2014;an examination of our share in those transactions&#x2014;soon. I am not certain that such a discussion or examination can reasonably take, place soon, because I am sure that he will understand and the House will understand that it is not for us&#x2014;it would hardly be courteous for us&#x2014;to have a discussion of those momentous transactions in which our interests, though great and serious, are comparatively indirect, until two things have happened: first, until there has been a discussion in the Reichstag, and, second, until there has been a discussion in the French Parliament. The other day&#x2014;I think I am right&#x2014;in the Reichstag the German Chancellor declined to discuss these transactions until a conclusion of one kind or another had been reached, and promised that when it was reached there would be an opportunity of discussion. The French Parliament, I think, is not now sitting. At any rate the broad fact is that it would be inexpedient for us, whose interest, as I have said, is comparatively indirect, to examine these complex and difficult transactions, without Papers and so on, until we knew how they are viewed by the two great communities whose interests are most directly concerned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TRIBUTES TO LORD ONSLOW AND<lb/> LORD JAMES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00134"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before beginning public business I am sure it will be the desire of the House that we should take regretful note of the
<col>10</col>
fact that since the House rose for the holidays two valued and important members of this House have disappeared from among us. Lord James and Lord Onslow differed in many qualities, and they differed in the range of their public; activities, but they have both left behind them kind, friendly, and warmly appreciative recollections and memories.<lb/>
Lord Onslow was the bearer of a name which has been familiar in our Parliamentary history since the days of Queen Elizabeth. One of the bearers of that name was for thirty-three years, in five successive Parliaments, Speaker of the House of Commons, and when his time came to an end in 1761 the House of Commons passed a vote thanking him for his constant and unwearied attendance. The Lord Onslow that we all knew and so much liked was not so long in the chair of the Lord Chairman, but he was there quite long enough to show this House and all who are concerned in the business of the House his fidelity to the trust that had been committed to him. The noble Marquess opposite (Lord Lansdowne) said when Lord Onslow resigned&#x2014;my own experience is too short for me to speak adequately on the matter&#x2014;that your Lordships had never known a Chairman more attentive and more assiduous in the performance of his duties. Lord Onslow held various offices&#x2014;some higher and some lower&#x2014;with ability and diligence. For a time he discharged the duties of the Governor of an important Colony with credit, honour, and complete success. In the Chair, judging from my own comparatively limited experience, he carried weight because of his strong sense of fair play and his desire to give every opportunity that was lair and legitimate to opinions and points of view which he did not himself share, but which he felt had a right to utterance in the House. His own opinions were strong and decided&#x2014;perhaps he did not always conceal them&#x2014;but there was about Lord Onslow's polities a geniality which well became the post he filled and from which lie never departed. This may be noted, that nothing could exceed his willingness to help every member of the House. The noble Marquess said that it could not be doubted that, Lord Onslow in the last days of his life had aggravated the mischief from which he was suffering by his perseverance in the duties of the post which he occupied. I am sure
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0010"/>
<col>11</col>
everybody will feel admiration for his character and his work. The regret is universal at his loss; so, too, is universal the recognition and appreciation both of his character and of what he did in the House. He had learned. I think, some of the special duties of the post of Lord Chairman when he was a member of the London County Council. In all the details of private business, which we on these red benches see and hear little of, his experience on that body gave him a great advantage, and he used that advantage to the full.<lb/>
Then I come to Lord James. He had, we all know, a great career in what I make bold to call the most powerful of professions. In the course of that career he won a seat in the House of Commons, and he there achieved a speedy and a marked success. He had been trained, and highly trained, in the art of honourable advocacy, and he showed that proficiency in the art of advocacy&#x2014;there are at this moment many examples to confirm the view&#x2014;is not in the least incompatible with Parliamentary gifts. Let me recall&#x2014;I am sure the noble and learned Earl opposite (Lord Halsbury) will recall&#x2014;with what skill and good temper Lord James conducted through the House of Commons an extremely difficult and complex Bill&#x2014;the memorable Bill against corrupt electoral practices. In this House it did not fall to him to pilot any great measure of that dimension, but whenever he addressed the House it always struck me that he addressed it in a tone of deliberation. Although it may seem strange to say it, it has always struck me that the tone of deliberation is not the commonest of things in deliberative Assemblies&#x2014;not always in Parliament, not always in administrative and executive bodies, and perhaps not always even in Cabinets. Lord James had that tone of deliberation. One felt that he was trying to impress the House with the very arguments which had convinced him in the formation of his own judgment.<lb/>
I pass to another point. In political life, with all its tremendous difficulties and tremendous temptations, it does not matter much more what opinions a man holds than with what steadfastness and straightforwardness he holds them. Lord James was a model of clear opinions firmly held. It is unfortunately too well known to many of us that in our generation&#x2014;and here
<col>12</col>
I am speaking of my own, which is longer than that of many members of the House&#x2014;there have been three great divisions of opinion and of action among Parliamentary leaders, and three great divisions in the political mind of the country. Friends have been severed, Party cohesion has been broken, and the political hearts of men have been shaken. On all these severe and testing occasions neither of the two great Parties in the State has been wanting in fine and conspicuous examples of personal disinterestedness and personal self-sacrifice. Of these manifold cases I know none more admirable than the case of Lord James. He had within his hand the highest prizes, whether of his professional or his political career, and all the natural impulses of a perfectly legitimate ambition in Lord James gave way to his sense&#x2014;right or wrong&#x2014;of public responsibility. He was one of those&#x2014;and I knew him well&#x2014;who thought none of these prizes, important as they are, more enviable than the prize of the attachment of his colleagues and the general esteem of his countrymen.<lb/>
So much for Lord James's public traits. I think I should be wrong if I left out this private trait. He was always on the look out, keenly on the look out, to help younger men at the Bar, men with no high connection and with small prospects&#x2014;he was always keen to hold out to them such a helping hand as a great and tried lawyer can hold out to an untried one with his life before him. But beyond this generous readiness of professional help his sympathies were very wide and ever generous; indeed, I might say from knowledge that he was not only generous but sometimes what might have been thought even lavish. He was very careful always not to let his left hand know all his right hand was doing in this field. Of him, who might have been Lord Chancellor, it is not too much to say that he lived in the spirit of a famous saying of the greatest of our Lord Chancellors, Lord Bacon&#x2014;"The nobler a soul is, the more objects of compassion it hath." We are living, as we know to our cost, in an age and in an hour of deep commotion in respect to the institutions of our country; but, after all, w hen we look at the foundations of things, what matters more than anything else is that our leading men, whether they be Lords of Parliament or men in homelier stations, who work these institutions should be men of sterling character. I submit,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0011"/>
<col>13</col>
and I am sure the whole House will agree, that the two men whom we regretfully commemorate this evening were of a sound and sterling character such as has never been surpassed by any of those who have held high place within the walls of this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00135"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can add very little to what has been said by the noble Viscount of the two distinguished members of this House whose deaths we are lamenting this evening. They happened to be both political allies and colleagues of us who sit on this side of the House, and political opponents of the noble Viscount, but I am sure I express the feelings of those who sit around me when I say that we could not have desired a more fitting or appropriate tribute to be paid to the memory of Lord James of Hereford and of Lord Onslow than that to which we have just listened. The noble Viscount said, I think with great truth, that the two men were of very different types; their careers were different, their personal characteristics were different, and the spheres of their activities were different, but they were both of them men whom any Legislative Assembly might well have been proud to number amongst its members.<lb/>
Lord James of Hereford fought his way to the foremost rank without any adventitious aids, he fought his way to a foremost place in his profession, and to a not less prominent place in our political life. The noble Viscount has spoken of his high position at the Bar, and I will add nothing to what he said on that point, except with regard to one fact to which he referred&#x2014;that at a particular moment Lord James had within his grasp the greatest prize to which a lawyer can aspire, almost the greatest prize to which any subject of the Crown may aspire, and that he forwent that prize because at that particular moment while his interests pointed one way his convictions pointed in an opposite direction. That one fact appears to me to establish all that we desire to establish with regard to Lord James's high character and reputation. In the House of Commons he was always a conspicuous figure. He delivered speeches there which are still remembered by those who had the advantage of hearing them. In connection with his political career I cannot resist, as one who feels
<col>14</col>
a deep reverence for the memory of the late Duke of Devonshire, referring to the fact that throughout his long political career a man so strong, so full of sterling qualities, and so keen a judge of men as the late Duke of Devonshire should have always regarded Lord James as one of his most intimate friends and counsellors. In this House we always listened to him as to one speaking with an authority to which few members could pretend. His career was a long one, representing considerably more than half a century of public service of the most useful and meritorious description unbroken by any interval of idleness.<lb/>
Lord Onslow became a member of this House by inheritance when he was quite a young man. He owed his opportunities to what is sometimes&#x2014;not always felicitously&#x2014;called the "accident of birth." No doubt he inherited with his high position a certain aptitude for the kind of public business which at different times he was called upon to perform. He served art apprenticeship in more than one public Department, and left behind him in each of them a great reputation for industry, ability, and knowledge of men. He was called to represent the Crown in one of our great Colonies, where I believe I am right in saying he is even to-day remembered with the greatest affection, and not only by men of his own race, but by that native community in whose welfare he so deeply interested himself. In the Department of Agriculture he found himself called to a post the duties of which were specially congenial to him. I doubt whether it would have been possible to find a Minister more likely from his antecedents and personal qualities to command the full confidence of the three classes interested in the land of the country, whether owners, occupiers, or tillers of the soil. He had a practical knowledge of agricultural affairs enabling him to deal with success with problems the business side of which is not always sufficiently borne in mind. This House paid to Lord Onslow the greatest compliment that it can pay to one of its members when it called upon him to assume the duties of Chairman. I do not think the noble Viscount said a word more than was proper and necessary when he spoke of the absolute fairness, good temper, and geniality which characterised his performance of the duties of Lord Chairman;
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0012"/>
<col>15</col>
and what I venture to say of Lord Onslow in that respect also has reference to the manner in which he performed the much more exacting duties which fall upon the Lord Chairman in connection with the private business of this House which takes place outside the walls of the Chamber in which we are sitting to-day.<lb/>
If time permitted, I should have been glad to say a word of the way in which Lord Onslow filled his position as a great country gentleman, and of his interest in all local and municipal questions, but I only mention one other point which I think ought not to be passed by without a word of notice this evening&#x2014;I mean the pains which Lord Onslow took to bring members of this House together in private deliberation and consultation in regard to the business of the House. He was instrumental in creating opportunities for most useful discussion of that sort, which, owing to the peculiar conditions under which our work is done, come to us, I am afraid, somewhat too rarely. In one of the obituary notices which appeared on the day after his death it was said that Lord Onslow had been described by a Colonial authority as "a good straight English gentleman of the best type." We may be sure that Lord Onslow would have desired no better epitaph, nor would any of us, I suppose, desire any other words to be spoken of us when we are no longer there to hear them. It is as a good straight Englishman of the best type that we shall always remember Lord Onslow and always regret him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00136"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I rise to say a word or two on the subject which has occupied your Lordships' attention this evening it is because I can claim with the late Lord James a friendship of more than fifty years, during which, both in political life and in the Courts of Law, we have been opponents more often than we have been together. I can say truthfully of Lord James of Hereford that, whether in political or forensic life, I have never met a more honourable and straightforward opponent. That I have been his opponent more often than with him is accident, of course. Although I have not been always of the same politics as he was, that fact never at any time interfered with our friendship; indeed, when Lord James's seat in Parliament was assailed by petition I had the honour of aiding and assisting
<col>16</col>
him to retain the seat which he so much adorned afterwards. I concur also with what was said by the noble Viscount the Leader of the House with reference to Lord James's conduct of the Corrupt Practices Act, a most wholesome and useful measure, which was brought to a successful issue by the skill with which he conducted it. Your Lordships know how well the public career of Lord James deserved the graceful encomiums which were passed upon it by the noble Viscount, but there was a side of his character with which none but his intimate friends became familiar. A more generous and kindhearted man never lived. No case in which the suffering and the poor were engaged failed to obtain his assistance when it was sought. No case of suffering or poverty of any sort or kind wanting assistance failed to obtain it from him when he was satisfied that the case was real. I think it is right that this should be said of Lord James's private character, as it was known by those among whom he lived and by whom he is most mourned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00153"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel some diffidence in moving the Amendment which stands in my name, which is to leave out Clause 1 of this Bill. The reason why I venture to move its omission is not so much because I think that the clause will, after your Lordships have heard what is to be said about it, be struck out, but because I think that in these international matters and in anything affecting the question of commerce and shipping it is extremely desirable that the facts should be put before your Lordships. In that way you will be able to see whether the advantages to be gained by the retention of this clause, which I think I may say is practically the vital clause of the Bill, overwhelm and outweigh such objections as have been felt with regard to the proposition which it establishes.<lb/>
This clause has for its object the making of damage or loss caused in consequence of a collision between two or more vessels fall upon the owners of those vessels in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in fault, and that is a matter which I think I shall show gives rise to considerable difficulty in its actual working
<col>18</col>
out. If the clause were omitted the present law of England would apply. I will state that law in one moment. But think it is necessary to state at the outset of the few observations which I shall make that very great confusion in maritime laws has prevailed in connection with the subject of what should be the division of loss when two vessels, or more vessels, which is extremely rare, come into collision and do damage to each other and the cargoes on board them. For many years conferences have been at work, of which think those collected together by the International Maritime Committee have been most effective. I ought perhaps to say that the Governments of the various countries all over the world&#x2014;there may be sonic exceptions, but substantially the whole of the great nations of the world&#x2014;ultimately met, through their representatives, and produced, after, I think, two or more years of meetings, a Code which is now one of the Codes on this subject which have to be considered for adoption.<lb/>
There have been four Codes. Two of them have been adopted by the representatives of His Majesty's Government. One of them is the Code on which arises the question of collisions between ships; the other has reference to the question of salvage rendered at sea by one vessel to another. There are two other Codes still in process of negotiation and discussion&#x2014;Codes for the purpose of declaring what shall be the limits of liability of vessels and their owners, and what shall be the liens and claims upon them and how those liens and claims shall rank. So far those latter two have not produced sufficient uniformity in the Congresses to be adopted by His Majesty's Government. The two, however, which form the subject of the present Bill have; and in order to appreciate precisely the effect and the advantages or disadvantages of them, I think your Lordships should be in possession of the various forms or leading forms in which these questions of liability for collisions have been dealt with. You should know how much uniformity has been obtained and what are the advantages to be gained, and also the disadvantages which I suggest have from one point of view to be taken into account.<lb/>
Before 1875, when the Judicature Act came into force in this country, the English Common Law and the Admiralty Law of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0014"/>
<col>19</col>
England differed. By the English Common Law, where two vessels collided and there was a blame on both of them the loss was allowed to rest where it fell. In cases where both vessels contributed to the disaster one could not recover against the other. But the Admiralty rule had for two or three centuries been that where two vessels collided and both were in fault the owners had to divide between them the total loss which had happened and each bear one-half of it. That was founded on earlier decisions and gradually came to be the rule of the Admiralty. In 1875, however, the Judicature Act was passed, and though at first it was intended to adopt the Common Law rule, finally it was the Admiralty rule which was adopted, and the Judicature Act provided that that rule should prevail throughout the country. Therefore both at Common Law and in Admiralty the rule became one and the same. That rule, which divided the loss, works very satisfactorily, and there was, as far as I can make out, no substantial grievance at all in the effect of its operation.<lb/>
What grievance there was, which I think led to the acceptance of these proposals in England, was that the Statute which regulated navigation provided that, if any of the Collision Regulations were infringed, that infringement should of itself lead to the condemnation of the vessel that infringed them, unless it was proved that a departure from the Regulations was necessary. The result of the application of this rule of both vessels being held to blame was this. There were cases in which the real substantial negligence was on the part of one vessel, but because there had been some breach&#x2014;a very trifling breach, it may be, and not necessarily conducing to the collision&#x2014;on the part of the other vessel, that vessel was also held in fault and the division of loss equally took place. One of the clauses in this Bill does away with that liability for a breach of the Collision Regulations. It is Clause 4, which provides that subsection (4) of Section 419 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 (which provides that a ship shall be deemed in fault in a case of collision where any of the Collision Regulations have been infringed by that ship) is hereby repealed; and so the real difficulty which was raised by that presumption and the hardship which it produced is to be done away with. If that were done away with and nothing else were done, and
<col>20</col>
the present rule remained as it is, it would be necessary, and it is thought reasonable that it should be necessary, to prove, in cases where both vessels were to blame, that their fault in each case contributed to the collision; so that that clause by itself would remove what I believe was the only grievance in this country prior to the present time.<lb/>
In other countries there were three leading systems&#x2014;I will state them very briefly in order that this particular clause may be appreciated&#x2014;of assessing damage where two vessels were to blame. The first was that the damage should rest where it fell. As I have already stated, that was in force at Common Law in England until 1875. Up to that time, and I believe up to the present, that rule had been the rule in the United States of America on its Common Law side, though not on its Admiralty side. It was also the rule in Germany up till recent times. I believe in 1906 they adopted the principle which is now indicated in this new proposal. It was the rule in Holland, in Italy, in Russia usually, in Spain, in the Argentine Federation, in Uruguay, in Venezuela, and in some other countries. Substantially one may say that in a number of countries the rule was that the damage should rest where it fell, and neither could recover from the other. In other countries the gross damage was divided equally and borne by the two respective shipowners. That was so in Great Britain, in her Colonies, and on the Admiralty side in the United States of America; and I think I am correct in saying that the probability is that there were more cases under that rule than under any other, as the shipping of Great Britain and her Colonies was so enormous and the Admiralty Court was so generally resorted to. The third leading rule adopted was that the gross damage should be apportioned between the owners according to the degree of the blame of the vessels. That rule has been adopted in Belgium, in France, in Greece, in Portugal, in Germany, by the Scandinavian States, and also in Roumania. So far I have been dealing with damages that have happened to ships. There was a fourth form of leading rule&#x2014;the whole of the damages appear to have been put together and a sort of general average made of those damages according to the value of the vessels which were in collision. But that only applied, I believe, in Turkey and in
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0015"/>
<col>21</col>
Egypt, in their international and native tribunals. Where the case was one of the cargo's position, matters were more complicated and the practice differed in the various countries. The rule as to life claims also differs, and the Code which the Conference adopted, and which this Bill proposes to assist in adopting generally, was intended to do away with this confusion. In the rules applied in Great Britain and in Admiralty cases in the United States, as I have said, the division of loss was equal; it was simple and easy of application, and the only grievance felt&#x2014;I believe I am correct&#x2014;was that the statutory fault was too severe a penalty.<lb/>
I turn again to the proposal which is before the House in this Bill. It is that the loss should be in proportion to the degree of fault in which each vessel was found to blame. The point to which I wish to draw attention is this, that this clause endeavours to establish a form of liability which it is practically impossible to apply with any degree of accuracy. Consider for a moment the case of a collision between two vessels and whether one can say the precise proportion of fault on those vessels which led to the collision. It is, I think&#x2014;and in this I have the authority of Judges of the Admiralty Court in former days&#x2014;practically impossible; and the older Judges in the Admiralty Division, or the Admiralty Court as it then was, got rid of all that difficulty by declaring that no human being could say how much blame was to be attached to each of the vessels. They therefore adopted the rule that if both contributed to the collision each should bear half the loss, and that has been the English rule.<lb/>
I have stated that the rule has been different in a great many other countries, and given the three leading classes of rule which have been adopted. I venture to suggest that there are these considerations. First of all, with regard to the rule now proposed in this clause, that no one can properly say what is the proportion or degree of fault which should fall upon a particular vessel. It is not a rule which can be worked practically, except by what has been done, as I understand, on the Continent. A note has there been circulated to the effect that in "both to blame" cases ninety per cent. of those cases have been divided by the Judges equally&#x2014;
<col>22</col>
that is to say. in ninety per cent. of the cases where both vessels were to blame the Judges have been unable, as no human being, I think, is able, to divide the loss in proportion to the fault. Consequently they have jumped it, as our old Admiralty Judges did, by saying each pays half. There is a second point which, having had some experience in the Admiralty Court, I should like to bring forward. I do not think it is desirable that a Judge should be placed, as it were, simply in an arbitrator's position in which he has to make a rough-and-ready shot as to blame. In my opinion this would tend to weakness of decision. The third point is this. I do not see how it is possible for the same case tried by one tribunal and then appealed against to necessarily result in the same decision on appeal&#x2014;that is to say, I do not see how two men will necessarily come to the same conclusion on the question of proportion of fault, or how there is to be any definite certainty of decision.<lb/>
I have called attention to these points because I attach importance to them. The difficulty that I feel is this. I have throughout had some connection with the proposals and discussions which have led to these Conventions. I have ventured always to maintain this attitude about this particular rule of division. But one cannot avoid saying this, that this is an international matter, and it is very desirable to have a uniform rule applicable all over the high seas. All the countries who were signatories to the Convention have, I believe, agreed to the adoption of this proportionate rule. Some of them, as I have shown, had that proportionate rule in operation long before. There has also been a feeling amongst a large section in England that it is an advantageous rule to have, and I do not think I can say that in the objections I have stated I have had that support which resists a general agreement in favour of uniformity. The result, therefore, comes to this. You have, on the one hand, the great desire for uniformity of the law all Over the ocean; you have an agreement by the nations which will produce that uniformity; and you have, as against that, the objections which I have stated. While probably your Lordships will think that, the advantages of uniformity. outweigh the objections I have suggested, I have felt it a duty that one who has had a great deal to do with these cases should state the objections so that the House
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0016"/>
<col>23</col>
should be in full possession of the general considerations applicable to this question before coming to a definite conclusion upon it.<lb/>
I would only add that there is very little else except machinery in this Bill. That is to say, there is very little else in the two Conventions which this Bill proposes to ratify except the difficulty that arises on this clause. I have stated the objections to the clause so that your Lordships should know the objections as well as the great advantages that arise from adopting a rule which will enable all nations to act upon the same basis. If that rule were not adopted, I doubt very much whether these Conventions would be agreed to at all. I beg to formally move my Amendment to leave out Clause 1.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00155"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need hardly say that I feel the greatest diffidence in rising to discuss this subject with so great an authority as the noble and learned Lord who has just addressed the House, but at the same time I am encouraged by the attitude which he adopted towards the Bill in general, and also by the invariable fairness which he displays and by his readiness to listen to and give consideration to views which are not exactly in accordance with his own. The noble and learned Lord has stated the three principal rules which had to be considered before this Convention was signed&#x2014;that is to say, the Common Law rule, the Admiralty rule, and the proportional rule; and I will endeavour very shortly to tell your Lordships what induced the Board of Trade to adopt the proportional rule which is introduced in this Bill.<lb/>
The Common Law rule, as the noble and learned Lord pointed out, lays down that the loss in the case of a collision where both vessels are to blame lies where it falls. This Common Law rule, generally speaking, may be found to work extremely well; but there is certainly ground for considering it unsuitable in connection with shipping matters where very large sums are involved, and where the circumstances attending the case are very often peculiar. It may, for instance, be fair enough that a man who is knocked down by a motor-
<col>24</col>
car should not receive compensation if he contributed to the accident by his own negligence. But let us take the case of a collision where both ships were to blame and were one ship suffers damage to the extent of many thousands of pounds and the other ship escapes with the loss, perhaps, of a little paint. Under the Common Law rule the whole of the loss would fall upon the one ship, although the fault lay at the door of both ships. There was also this fact to be taken into consideration, that Parliament deliberately rejected this rule in favour of the Admiralty rule at the time of the passing of the Judicature Act of 1873, and there is no reason for supposing that the various interests concerned would welcome so great a reversal of the present system as would be involved if a return were made to the Common Law rule. There therefore remain the two other rules&#x2014;the Admiralty rule, which at present obtains under English law, where the aggregate of loss is divided and each vessel pays one-half, and the rule which is proposed in this Bill. I may say that this question was very thoroughly examined into and all the criticisms were considered by the Board before they agreed to the Convention.<lb/>
Perhaps it would be as well to allude to the principal criticisms in order to show how the Board arrived at its conclusions. The first criticism was that this proportional rule was not founded on principle. I think that to a certain extent this is true, but one might suppose that those who advanced this argument in order to retain the present rule&#x2014;the Admiralty rule&#x2014;were under the impression that the Admiralty rule was founded on principle. This I do not think anybody could maintain, for it has been known for many years as <i>rusticum judicium,</i> a rough-and-ready form of justice. On the other hand, there does seem to be in the proportional rule a certain amount of what one might, perhaps, call principle, in the fact that the proportional rule endeavours to make the greater sinner pay the greater penalty. But the principal criticism which has been addressed to this proposal is that it is impossible for a Court to fix the exact amount of fault attached to each vessel, and that the proportional rule will lead to weak judgments. The noble and learned Lord who has just addressed your Lordships stated that this proportional rule does already obtain in certain foreign
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0017"/>
<col>25</col>
countries, and he also alluded to the fact that in those countries ninety per cent. of the cases were decided on the half-and-half division. In this Bill a distinct provision is made which allows the Court to give a half-and-half decision where it cannot arrive at a conclusion as to what is the proportion of the damage. Ninety per cent. of these cases being decided on the half-and-half division, we are left with a very small minority where presumably the fault of one of the vessels was so very much greater than that of the other that the Judge had no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion as to how the proportion should be assigned. It is, of course, impossible to expect Courts to work out the proportion of blame with mathematical accuracy, but at any rate the provisions of this clause do admit of some differentiation being made where the greater culpability of one vessel is flagrant and proved beyond all doubt.<lb/>
I might, perhaps, give one instance of the sort of case in which this proportional division might be applied. In the <i>Shipping Gazette</i> of March 14, 1899, a collision was reported between the "India" and "Hopper No. 5." The President of the Admiralty Division, in delivering judgment that both vessels were to blame, said it was impossible to justify the "Hopper's" conduct in endeavouring to cross the "India's" bows in the way attempted. The main cause of the collision was the conduct of the "Hopper," but the advice of the Trinity Masters was that the "India" had committed an error of judgment. In those circumstances, though he said it with some regret, the President of the Admiralty Division held that he could not disregard the advice which the Trinity Masters had given him, and must hold the "India" to blame. That was a case in which obviously it was with the greatest reluctance that the half-and-half division was applied, and a certain number of similar cases occur from time to time. One other criticism which was brought against this proposal was that the rule would lead to more litigation and to more appeals. This is a question upon which I, personally, am not at liberty to say very much, as I really know nothing concerning that particular point. At the same time it is a question which it is difficult to decide until we have had some experience to show us what really will be the result. It has been said that this proportional rule will
<col>26</col>
give some inducement to contest a case in the hope of escaping with a minority of the damages; but against that one must consider the fact that under the present rule there is certainly an inducement to contest a case in the hope that by the fact of the other vessel being found guilty of some small error of judgment she should have to bear one-half of the damages.<lb/>
Apart altogether from the points to which I have alluded, I should like to say one word with regard to the general aspects of the case. This clause, as the noble and learned Lord has pointed out, is of vital importance to the Bill. In fact, I think he said that it was practically the only thing which there was in the Bill. I was glad that he said that, for this reason. I think the fact of the Bill containing as little as he says shows that these two Conventions which were signed last year are practically an affirmation, or at any rate chiefly an affirmation, with the exception which he mentioned, of our own law. The Salvage Convention is entirely an affirmation. Therefore I think we have some cause for congratulation from that point of view. Again, I think it would he impossible to under-estimate the immense advantages which would be gained from a unification of maritime law, could such an end be attained. The omission of this clause and the consequent loss of the Bill would undoubtedly retard to a very considerable degree the progress which has been made in the direction of this object, which is so greatly to be desired.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00156"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble and learned friend who has moved this Amendment has had considerable experience in the particular matters with which we are now engaged, and I confess that I should differ from him with very great difficulty and doubt. If one had had no experience oneself, I think one would feel that one ought to treat such experience as his with very great respect. But there is much to be said for his reasoning apart from the great value of his experience. Imagine the position of a Judge who has to try the question, not only of the merits between the parties, but the question of the proportion of negligence. It is not the proportion of damage done, but the proportion of negligence. The Judge has to consider some error in navigation on both sides and then try to reduce that into the question of damages to see how much
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0018"/>
<col>27</col>
one side ought to pay and how much the other. I confess that that seems to me to introduce a question of great difficulty. The authors of this Bill seem to have been quite aware of that, for there is a provision that if the Judge cannot decide the proportion of negligence then he may divide it between the two. It is to be remembered that all these rules, if they do not follow natural justice, acquire a value through being the known rules, and I think there ought to be very considerable advantage established before Parliament departs from known rules. That which most of all makes litigation expensive and difficult is that people should not know what the law is. Very often when one of these difficult problems comes up for discussion it is said, "Oh, let the Judges settle it." I do not think that is fair upon the Judges, and I should like very much to hear what my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has to say upon the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00157"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards the last observation of the noble and learned Earl, I very heartily agree with him. I have had occasion to point out before that not infrequently in your Lordships' House and in the other House of Parliament when Members really cannot make up their minds as to what ought to be done in a difficult contingency, they say, "Oh, these words will do";&#x2014;very often the words are the result of a compromise&#x2014;"we will leave it to the Judges to decide"; and when the Judge, without any definite guidance, proceeds to put the best construction he can upon the enactment, he finds himself roundly abused for the gross injustice of his decision. As regards what the noble and learned Earl said on that point, I entirely agree.<lb/>
The particular matter which is now before the House is, of course, very important, because it affects the shipping of this country, and this is by far the greatest shipowning country in the world. I think it is a very good thing that this matter has been brought forward. It is a principle of great importance. My noble and learned friend Lord Gorell has rendered most kind and valuable service to the Government in regard to this and other kindred subjects, and also he is certainly the first authority in this country, and probably one of the first authorities anywhere, upon this matter. The way it strikes me is this. You have to deal with the case of a
<col>28</col>
collision. Suppose that you are asked, irrespective of whether you can carry out the principle or not, what is the ideal principle. I suppose the principle embodied in this Bill&#x2014;namely, that you should apportion the amount of damage to be paid to the amount of negligence&#x2014;would be accepted as ideal. It sounds perfect. It has all the delightful flavour of ideal equity, and it is logical if logic is dissociated from facts. It commends itself undoubtedly to many wise men on the Continent and also to many people here. The difficulty is in carrying it out. You now have a rule, good or bad, which is defective in some ways, but upon the whole works well&#x2014;the rule worked by our Court of Admiralty, by which you divide the loss. At all events, that gives people a standard by which they know how to measure what they have to do, and in most cases it is perfectly fair. It has that advantage. If you go to the other rule, and say that you are to apportion the loss according to the degree of fault, you find it most difficult. In the first place, you introduce a new element in litigation&#x2014;namely, as to damages&#x2014;and the next thing is that you really cannot say in many cases what is the proper proportion, Is one captain two-thirds more to blame than the other captain, or is it three-fourths? It leads to endless speculation, and it is a difficult, problem to solve, as you really have no standard of guidance.<lb/>
My consolation is this. I believe that, in accordance with the power reserved in this Bill, in nine cases out of ten, perhaps in nineteen cases out of twenty, the old rule will be observed, and the loss divided upon the ground that the Judge will say he really cannot be sure which of the two is the more to blame. I believe that will very often happen. But I do admit also that there may be cases&#x2014;I think Lord Gorell with his immense experience will agree&#x2014;in which the blame is almost nominal on the one side and the real substantial blame is on the other. In that sort of case you can say, "I think nearly all this ought to be borne by the one vessel." Perhaps in that case it may work out more equitable. I think the thing is fairly balanced between the old rule and the new. Certainly there is no injustice in the new proposal in this Bill. There are a great many people in this country who are strongly in favour of the new proposal. There is no doubt about
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0019"/>
<col>29</col>
that. There are a great many people who can show cases in which the existing rule has been very hard upon one ship. In those circumstances, since this has immense support here and is most strongly supported outside this country, we do not really lose anything. I think that on the whole it will work quite fairly, and therefore I was glad to notice that my noble and learned friend did not obstinately resist the first clause, but rather thought, as a counsel of perfection, it might be better to remain as we are. I hope my noble and learned friend will not persist in his Amendment. Probably most people in this country think the change is good. Certainly it is the result of a Maritime Convention to which all other parts of the world agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00158"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very much convinced by the arguments to which we have just listened from the noble and learned Earl the Lord Chancellor, but I venture to ask him whether the Bill as now drafted exactly accords with those arguments.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00160"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Will usually be adopted; but that in exceptional cases, where blame obviously inclined one way or the other, it was desirable that the Court should have the power of not dividing the damages equally, but making the balance incline more heavily On the one side than on the other. That seems to me a reasonable suggestion. But when I turn to the Bill itself, I find that in Clause 1 it is distinctly stated that the general rule is to be the rule of apportionment in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in fault, and then the Bill proceeds to give a proviso that in certain cases where it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault the liability should be apportioned equally. It seems to me that the Bill puts the exception where the noble and learned Earl puts the rule, and the rule where the noble and learned Earl puts the exception. I do not know if it is worth considering whether any improvement in the drafting might not be possible.</membercontribution></p>
<col>30</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00161"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It really comes to the same thing. The rule that is wanted is the rule to apportion the damage according to the blame. That is done in the clause. Then it is provided that if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is not possible to, establish different degrees of fault the liability shall be apportioned equally. What I said, or meant to say, was that in theory the first is right, but in practice you will find you cannot do it in many cases. I believe that in ninety cases out of a hundred you will find that the old rule will in fact be applied in virtue of the proviso.</membercontribution></p>

This clause provides that where personal injuries are suffered by any person on board a vessel owing to the fault of that vessel and of any other vessel or vessels, the vessels shall be jointly and severally liable for the damages; but it is confined at present to the ease of personal injuries. I understand that it was believed that personal injury claims were subject to the same rule of proportional division as
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0020"/>
<col>31</col>
I have explained. My Own view is that that is not correct, and I believe the opinion has been strongly entertained that there is no such rule of division in the case of bodily injuries. The provision I have read is put into the Bill here for the purpose of making clear that the rule dividing the damage is not to apply in the case of bodily injuries. Loss of life, too, is clearly a matter entirely outside the scope of any Admiralty rule. It was a matter in respect of which a claim could be made under Lord Campbell's Act. That Act enabled an action to be brought by the personal representatives of a person deceased by negligence, and compensation for that loss to be recovered against any person who was to blame, and therefore it could be recovered both jointly and severally. It may not be strictly necessary to insert the words "loss of life" here, but I think it is necessary when one comes to the further clauses of the Bill. Certainly there can be no harm in stating that in respect of loss of life the owners of the vessels shall be jointly and severally liable. If your Lordships turn to Clause 3, you will find that it is in accordance with the scheme of these Conventions that if one owner is sued and pays the whole of the loss in respect of loss of life or personal injuries, he may turn round on his co-wrongdoer and get from him a contribution in proportion to the degree of fault. I think it is desirable that Clause 3 should have intelligibility given to it by Clause 2 being amended in the way I suggest.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00219"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My next Amendment deals with a matter which requires a moment's consideration. In the Convention which I have before me there is this provision, that the grounds upon which the periods of limitation&#x2014;one being the two years already mentioned and the other one year&#x2014;may be suspended or interrupted are to be determined by the law of the Court where the case is tried; and, further, that the high contracting parties reserve to themselves the right to provide by legislation in their respective countries that the said period shall be extended in cases where it has not been possible to arrest the defendant vessel in the territorial waters of the State in which the defendant has his domicile or principal place of business. The clause as at present drawn only gives a power to extend in the one case where the Court is satisfied that there has not been during such period any reasonable opportunity of arresting the defendant vessel within the territorial waters of the country to which the plaintiff's ship belongs or in which the plaintiff resides or has his principal place of business. My next two Amendments have for their object the giving to the Court of a wider discretion. It is not desirable that the only case in which the two years may be extended is where there has been no opportunity of arrest. There might be cases of the death of owners and difficulties of that character, and the time might elapse before matters were put straight. It seems to me desirable that the Court should have a more general extending power than is at present conferred by the clause. The other alteration is not that
<col>36</col>
the Court "may" extend if there has been no opportunity, but that it "shall" extend. It seems to me that the Court ought not to be left to exercise its discretion if there has been no opportunity at all within the two years of arresting the vessel. There ought to be a right to an extension, such as the Judge thinks fit, which will give a reasonable opportunity of arresting the vessel.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00239"><member>LORD GORELL</member> moved the insertion of a new subsection, to provide that proceedings in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injuries may be brought <i>in rem</i> or <i>in personam.</i> The noble and learned Lord said: This is a matter of considerable importance. Your Lordships will notice that there is in the Bill a right to proceed against the owners of vessels jointly or severally for loss of life or personal injuries. Now certainly for loss of life there is no right of process <i>in rem,</i> and this unfortunate position would result unless my Amendment is introduced. Take the case of two vessels colliding in the English Channel, one of which is a British ship and the other a foreign ship, and both of which put into Dover or London. The English owners can be sued in respect of personal injuries at Common Law; they can be sued under Lord Campbell's Act for loss of life. That is to say, the English owners can be made responsible in full. But how would they proceed to enforce any contribution from the other wrongdoer, he being a foreigner? Under the Bill at present they could not do it without suing him abroad in his own country. Therefore it seems to me desirable, from the contribution point of view, that any person who pays in full and can be compelled to pay in full shall have a right <i>in rem</i> against the foreigner and to enforce it in this country. Otherwise in all these cases it would be impossible to get at the foreign ship at all to enforce the contribu-
<col>38</col>
tion. Further, the Convention contemplates that the ships of all nationalities embraced in it shall have this liability upon them. I therefore propose the insertion of a new claim to provide that proceedings in respect of claims for loss of life or personal injuries may be brought <i>in rem</i> or <i>in personam.</i> The whole object is to carry out what is intended by this Code, that vessels which were both to blame shall be made to contribute; and there seems no reason why this should not include a right to go direct against the vessels, whether they are foreign or British.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00250"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to ask your Lordships' attention to the provisions of a Bill which in one sense is of the second order. It is not a Bill which raises any political controversy. It is not a Bill which excites the interest that some of the great measures which have been recently before Parliament have excited, but yet it is a Bill of very great magnitude and importance. It is a Bill which affects large interests, and I think it is a testimony to the skill of my colleague the President of the Board of Trade that he should have succeeded, first in constructing it at all, and then in piloting it through the House of Commons in the form in which it now comes up to this House. I must add that it is a Bill which necessarily affects a number of interests, and interests which are not reconcilable. It is essentially a Bill of this kind&#x2014;that you should give to somebody something you take from somebody else. Therefore it is a Bill which in its essence raises small and troublesome points, and the business of a Minister is to construct it in such a fashion as to make the maximum possible advance with the least possible injustice. I do not say that nobody will complain of things that there are in this Bill, but I think in every case it will be found that the President of the Board of Trade has been right in the balancing of advantages and disadvantages.<lb/>
The Bill does three things. In the first place, it goes as far as is practicable towards establishing a complete Code of copyright law; next it makes provision for international copyright&#x2014;that is to say, if other nations treat us well according to a general system, we propose to treat them well, and give them the benefit of that system according to our law; and, in the third place, it lays the foundation of a uniform copyright, system throughout the Empire. The great self-governing Dominions must, of course, maintain their autonomy, but, subject to that, the Bill goes a long way to make what I believe will be a common system of copyright throughout the Empire. I will take these points in their order. The first is what I
<col>40</col>
may call the domestic character of the Bill, the changes which it makes in the law as it now stands. At present the domestic law is in a great state of confusion. Ever since Lord Camden differed from Lord Mansfield in 1774 in the case of "Donaldson <i>v</i>. Becket" no one has quite known what that Common Law of copyright was. Yet that Common Law of copyright is still relied on. In some cases the common rights subsist only till the statutory law becomes operative, and in other cases the Common Law right co-exists with the statutory right, so that the state of confusion is difficult to describe even to a lawyer.<lb/>
The subject-matter of copyright falls, as things stand at present, under four great heads. The term of copyright in each of these cases is different under the present law, and the rights conferred under the copyright when you have got it are different. For instance, copyright and performing right are treated as distinct rights. The result is that to find out what the law of copyright is involves wading through over twenty Statutes. This Bill sweeps away the whole of the Common Law and the whole of the Statute Law, with very small exceptions, and substitutes a Code. There are two Acts which will still remain operative, the Act of 1892 and the Act of 1906, which were passed for the special purpose of giving powers to stop the vending of pirated copies of music sold in the streets. These remain because they were of a complicated character and contained provisions which could not well be incorporated in this Bill. But with that exception and, I think, the exception of two other Acts, part of which it is convenient to leave standing, this Bill repeals some eighteen Statutes and also the special rules of Common Law, so that the law of copyright for the future will be comparatively simply ascertained. Then there is one other step taken of a distinctively forward character which comes under the description of domestic. That is, that copyright is extended to the right of reproduction. Performing right, for instance, becomes one of the copyrights. Then there are translations and mechanical reproductions&#x2014;as, for instance, by those rolls which are so familiar in connection with the gramophone. These things are brought in in a way in which they were not, brought in before. I have described genarally the domestic side of the Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0025"/>
<col>41</col>
I pass to the international side. As your Lordships know, in the year 1886 there was a conference of certain great Powers at Berne which established a Copyright Convention, followed ten years afterwards by the Convention of Paris; but in order to get forward it was necessary that further steps should be taken, and there was a great conference of the Powers in Berlin in 1908, at which certain principles were agreed upon of a very far-reaching and very liberal character. The essence of them was that all the technicalities in the way of obtaining copyright should be got rid of, and that there should be, as far as possible, something like a uniform standard. This country was a party to that Convention, and when the signatories returned it was necessary to see what steps should be taken in order to adapt our law to the new state of things. There had already been a Copyright Commission some years previously which had got a great deal of valuable material together, but it was necessary that the work should be taken in hand under the auspices of some lawyer of great experience, to find out what changes in the law should be made, and were proper to be made, and would require to be made, in order to bring the law of this country, and, indeed, of the Empire, into harmony with the provisions of the Berlin Convention. Lord Gorell undertook the very onerous task of presiding over the expert Committee which dealt with these subjects, and he and his colleagues produced a Report which has been the foundation of nearly everything which there is in this Bill. The general principle in dealing with foreign nations which is embodied in the Bill is this, that we let the subjects of foreign countries who publish books here take the benefit of our provision for copyright unless those foreign nations maltreat us by not giving our subjects similar concessions. On the other hand, in the case of books not published in this country, but which are entitled to international copyright in the strict and more extensive sense, then by Order in Council, if the country the subject of which seeks to get these rights gives the advantages of the new system to our subjects in that country, you can extend the application of this Bill so as to give the subjects of that country the benefit of copyright in this country for books which have been published abroad. That is the substance of the second main feature of the Bill relating to international copyright.<lb/>
<col>42</col>
I now come to the third part, what I may call the Imperial side. You cannot, of course, control the self-governing Dominions. There are already some of thenm&#x2014;Canada, for instance&#x2014;chafing under the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1842, which was an Imperial Act and extended to Canada. We sweep away that Act and set Canada and the whole of the Dominions quite free. On the other hand, the Bill which is before your Lordships extends to the whole Empire, subject to the power of the self-governing Dominions to deal with it as they please. The reason that has been made possible is this. There was an Imperial Conference on copyright in the year 1910, to which the various Dominions sent over representatives, and in which an agreement was come to to carry out legislatively the provisions of the Berlin Conference as put into shape by the Committee over which my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell presided. There was complete unanimity at that Conference, and its proceedings were agreeable to the Conference of this year, so much so that it was not necessary to deal with the subject in any detail. The Bill, therefore, represents what has been agreed upon at an imperial Conference, and in substance its provisions are these. In order to make the Imperial Act operative in any Dominion, the Dominion has to adopt it formally, and then it becomes the law of the Dominion as well as the law here. On the other hand, there may be some Dominion which gives substantially the same rights as the Bill gives without having solemnly adopted the system. In that case it is possible by Secretary of State's Order, by Proclamation, to give the benefit of the copyright system to the Dominion which has in substance, though not in form, adopted the provisions of this Bill. In that way it is hoped that there will be a uniform system all over the Empire. The effect of that is that some Dominions may not care to go the whole way in adopting the provisions of this Bill, and others may adopt it altogether. In the case of foreign countries, some will certainly go the whole way, while others may not care to deal with us and may not care to come in. But a great step forward has been taken in putting the law into such a shape that it is easy for these things to be done.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, come to the provisions of the Bill, and I will run through them
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0026"/>
<col>43</col>
very shortly. First I will describe what is done. The Statutes which are dealt with are some twenty in number, passed at various dates from 1734 down to 1906, each dealing with a separate part of the subject-matter, and varying in details in a manner which is as illogical as it is perplexing. The Statutes to which I have referred make no provision for the modern development of invention, such as the cinematograph, the phonograph, and the piano-player, all of which have an important hearing on the copyright law. The Bill practically repeals all these Statutes and also the special rules of Common Law, and places all works, so far as possible, under a uniform and amended system of law.<lb/>
I will deal with the principal changes which this Bill introduces before passing to the clauses. The various subjects of literary copyright, performing right in dramatic and musical works, engravings, paintings, drawings and photographs and sculpture, which are dealt with in some five series of Statutes, are now all placed upon a nearly uniform basis. The same term of copyright&#x2014;namely, the life of the author and fifty years after his death&#x2014;is given to all works, with two exceptions. The reason for that is twofold. First of all, it was the term which the great Powers which negotiated agreed on as the most reasonable. Secondly, those who were representing this country were much impressed by this fact, which was dwelt on in the inquiries which were made in this country, that an author very often receives little for his books during his life. It is, therefore, right that the term of copyright should include fifty years after his death. Under the existing law each of the five series of Statutes lays down a different term. For books it is forty-two years from publication or the life of the author and seven years, whichever is the longer. If the author's books have only become famous in his closing years, the period of seven years often does not enable adequate provision to be made for his family. In the case of photographs and mechanical instrument records and rolls&#x2014;the two exceptions I referred to&#x2014;these are given fifty years from the time of the making of the original negative or plate.<lb/>
As I have already indicated, the rights included in copyright are greatly extended. First of all, copyright is given for the first
<col>44</col>
time to works of architecture and mechanical instrument records, awl also to cinematograph films as a whole&#x2014;that is, as distinct front the separate photographs of which they are made up. Then general copyright is to include the sole right to reproduce the work, or any substantial part thereof, in any material form whatsoever. Then there are various provisions which are novel. The copyright in a work of art is in general infringed by reproduction in any other form of art&#x2014;for instance, a painting by means of sculpture, and so on. Then, again, copyright is to include the sole right to dramatise a novel or to issue a drama in book form. Copyright will include the sole right to make cinematograph films and mechanical instrument records, rolls, &amp;c., representing the work, or to perform it in public by means of such films, but subject, as there might arise an unjustifiable monopoly in these matters, to a certified system of compulsory licences. Copyright will include in the future the sole right of making translations. If it is desired to reserve the sole right of performing, or authorising performance in public, it will no longer be necessary, as it is now in the case of music, to print a notice to that effect on the work. Then, again, there is another advantage. Registration of copyright was a very futile thing. It was not necessary to register copyright, but you required to register before you could sue. That will not be any longer necessary. Provision is made for the innocent infringer. A person who was not aware, and had not reasonable means of making himself aware, that copyright existed will not be liable to damages, although he will be liable to an injunction and costs. After the expiration of twenty-five years&#x2014;or in the case of existing works thirty years&#x2014;after the author's death it will in general (except in the case of photographs, records, and rolls) be open to any one to reproduce a work for sale on condition only of giving prior notice of his intention to do so and paying a royalty of ten per cent. on the price at which he publishes the work. The object of that is, while protecting the fifty years during which the author or his executors are to have the copyright, to prevent the work from being shut out from the public.<lb/>
I think I have now described the main features of the Bill. There are others which arise in such detail that it will be more convenient for your Lordships to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0027"/>
<col>45</col>
look at them in the clauses of the Bill. I will very shortly draw attention to them. Clause 1 defines the mode in which copyright is to be obtained. It is to subsist for the term I have mentioned if the work is published within the King's Dominions, or, if the work has not been published in the King's Dominions, the author at the date of the making of the work was a British subject or resident within the King's Dominions. Then there is a definition of "copyright," the substance of which is that it is the sole right to produce or reproduce in any form.<lb/>
Clause 2 deals with infringement of copyright. An "infringer" is a person who does anything the sole right to do which is by the Act conferred on the owner of the copyright. There are certain provisions which are intended to mitigate the stringency of that. For instance, take a copyright book. The Bill provides that in the case of a collection mainly composed of non-copyright matter and <i>bona fide</i> intended for the use of schools, it is not to be an infringement to put in a short passage or a few short passages from a copyright book. Then, again, the publication in a newspaper of a report of a lecture delivered in public, unless the report is prohibited by conspicuous notice or printed notice affixed before and maintained during the lecture at or about the main entrance of the building in which the lecture is given, is not to be an infringement. The reading or recitation in public by one person of any reasonable extract from any published work is, again, not to be an infringement, and the clause goes through a series of cases of that kind. Clause 4 enables compulsory licences to be given if a complaint is made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that the owner of the copyright in a work has refused to republish or allow the republication of the work. I need not trouble your Lordships with the intervening clauses, which go into detail; but Clause 9 is important. Copyright is now given in architecture and architectural designs. Clause 9 provides that where the construction of a building or other structure which infringes, or which, if completed, would infringe, the copyright in some other work has been commenced, the owner of the copyright shall not be entitled to restrain the construction of the building or order its demolition. All he can get is damages, and that seems very reasonable.<lb/>
<col>46</col>
Then I come to Clause 15, which has given rise to a great deal of controversy. Under this clause the publisher of every book published in the United Kingdom is to deliver at his own expense a copy of the book to the trustees of the British Museum, to the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the University Library at Cambridge, the Library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh, and the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. I think that is the law at the present time. The publisher is also to give a copy to the National Library of Wales. The trustees of the British Museum are to have a copy of the whole book, with all maps and illustrations, and in the best form in which the book is published, but the others are to be on the paper on which the greater number of the books published are printed, and these books are only to be given if they are asked for by the libraries, other than in the case of the British Museum. It is complained that it is a burden on publishers to supply these books. So it is. But it must be remembered that publishers are getting protection and advantages under this Bill of a new kind. The term of copyright is enlarged and lengthened, and it does not seem unreasonable that they should bear this not very serious burden.<lb/>
The other clauses of the Bill comprise Clause 19, which confers the new copyright in mechanical contrivances, and the provisions which relate to foreign countries and to the Dominions. The Bill falls into these three parts and comes under these three heads. It is a Bill which covers a great deal of ground and makes large changes in the law, but upon the whole I submit to your Lordships that it is a Bill which ought to be looked at as one which has been demanded for a very long time. The state of our law of copyright is disgraceful, and the Bill at any rate has this great merit, that its provisions are very simple. Then it has the further great advantage that it meets with the concurrence of other nations, and gives the hope of an extension of international copyright&#x2014;a great blessing to authors and publishers alike. Finally, it is a Bill which has met with the good wishes and support of the self-governing Dominions. In these circumstances I ask your Lordships to give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00252"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having had the question of copyright very fully before me on the Committee which prepared the Report on which this Bill is founded, perhaps I may be permitted to detain your Lordships a moment or two upon the Second Reading of this Bill. I think that anybody who undertook the study of this subject would be struck at once by the fact that they had to consider some twenty different Acts of Parliament, ranging from the days of George II to the present time, and dealing with all sorts of different things, and dealing with them on different footings, for different terms of years, and so forth. I cannot help feeling that when one finds the whole of these difficult Acts brought into line with modern ideas in some thirty clauses of this Bill, immense credit is due to those who have constructed it.<lb/>
This Bill simplifies and consolidates the whole of the law of copyright, which has been in process of evolution for close on 200 years (apart from questions of what the Common Law was prior to that time), and it also brings into play provisions which deal with the Colonies and with foreign countries on the basis of the international agreement which has been entered into. It sweeps away all previous law, one may say, and gives the foundation for simple principles, which I think apply practically to all that is the subject of copyright. Broadly speaking, for all matters the author gets protection for his life and for fifty years after, with the exception of one or two matters like photographs and records, more or less mechanical productions, in which the fifty years dates from the time when the plate or negative was produced. It applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. It will, it is hoped, in time apply to the whole of the British Dominions, and its effect will operate throughout other countries which have joined the Union which produced the concord upon which the Report was based.<lb/>
When the Bill is looked through as it was originally introduced, I think one may say that it was practically in accord with the Report of the Committee that investigated the matter, but as it emerged from the other House it contained certain substantial Amendments or changes which are not entirely in accord with the views expressed by the Committee, and are not, I think, in accordance with the views of those who uphold to the full the rights of authors
<col>48</col>
in the production of their brains. In some respects it seems as if there had been rather less appreciation of property in brain product than was thought to be right by the Committee and than was proposed in the Bill as originally introduced. For instance, while copyright in works of literature is given in the Bill for life and fifty years, there is a proviso which cuts down that latter protection to twenty-five years, except so far as it concedes a percentage on the sales after that twenty-five years. There is another clause which prevents the owner of the copyright assigning the full benefit which it is contemplated he should have for his life and fifty years afterwards. The proviso to which I refer reduces that period by providing that he can only dispose of the copyright for his life and twenty-five years afterwards, and in respect of the remaining twenty-five years he can only dispose of his rights by will. That is a proviso which limits the benefit of the copyright, but it may be owing to the view that fifty years is too long a period. Those are matters which will probably have to be discussed in Committee.<lb/>
There is one other clause which was not in accordance with the Committee's Report. I refer to the new development of the phonographic and pianola industry. The effect of the Bill as it now stands is that if once a licence is given to any manufacturer, other manufacturers may claim to have the right to manufacture on paying certain royalties. That, again, is a curtailing of the full rights of the author. With regard to Clause 15, the publishers claim that not only is their burden left but that it is increased, and the suggestion will probably be made that that burden should be reduced in some form, so that they should not be obliged to provide five or six copies of very costly and expensive books for the benefit of those who can well pay for what they ask. Broadly speaking, I thoroughly agree that the Bill is one which deserves to pass as a great consolidation measure, and one which improves matters in many respects, but I am sure it requires careful consideration on many details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00253"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there can be no controversy as to the general character of this Bill. It is a great improvement on the present state of copyright law, and has been put before us in an intelligible and simple form. There
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0029"/>
<col>49</col>
are, however, one or two points in the Bill which appear to me not to have been sufficiently appreciated in their bearing on the well-being of the great reading community. This Bill proposes to extend the copyright in respect of books from forty-two years or the life of the author and seven years, whichever was the longer period, to the lifetime of the author and fifty years after the author's death. I submit that that is a claim to an extension of the time of copyright which is not supported by any injustice shown in the past and is not required in the interests of authorship, while it is much to be deprecated in the interests of education.<lb/>
The present period of copyright has amply sufficed, I submit, for the remuneration of authors as a whole. The extension of the period to fifty years after the author's death is supported on the ground that there are some cases in which authors do not become popular and their books do not sell until they are well advanced in life, and so they get little reward for what they may have produced if the copyright expires seven years after their death. I think it will be found on examination that such cases are extremely few, and few as they are, I submit that it would have been much better to have met the difficulty in a similar way to that in which the difficulty is met in respect of patents&#x2014;namely, by providing for an application to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for an extension of the copyright in such peculiar cases. But this Bill, in order to meet these peculiar cases, is going to sacrifice the whole reading public. I believe that this change in the law will not be found to operate at all to the advantage of authors, speaking broadly. It will be found to operate to the advantage of publishers only, who will get an extended period of the copyright in the books which they publish.<lb/>
I would like your Lordships to consider how this proposed law world have operated in the past within our own experience. Take the works of Walter Scott. Scott died in 1832, and under this proposed extension of the law copyright in all his works would have been maintained right down to 1882. Under the existing law, however, the copyright in his poems expired soon after Walter Scott's death and copyright in his novels dropped in at comparatively early dates, and there have been repeated editions of his works,
<col>50</col>
especially of his poems, at cheap prices which made them accessible to the mass of the community. Take the case of the poems of Wordsworth, who died in 1850. Under this Bill copyright in Wordsworth's poems would not have expired before 1900, and his works, therefore, would not have been accessible in the same way that they have been in the last generation. I appeal to my noble friend who leads the House. The noble Viscount brought out an edition of Wordsworth prefaced by an admirable essay on the character of the poet and his place in literature, arranged on what I believe to be a rational chronological principle. If this Bill had been law, it would have been impossible for my noble, friend to have brought out the book at the time he did, and the book would have been withheld from the public for many years. There are other books now within our reach which would not have been within our reach if this Bill had been law.<lb/>
Take the case of the works of Carlyle. Carlyle's "French Revolution" was published in 1837. The copyright of it expired seven years after the author's death, and we have been enabled, in consequence of the expiration of that copyright, to receive editions of the "French Revolution" edited in the most scholarly fashion, with notes on matters of another generation, providing a most admirable presentment of the work for the education of the new generation. Had this Bill been law it would have been impossible to have brought out those editions of the "French Revolution." The copyright would have been maintained down to the year 1931. So, again, with the poems of Browning. His earlier poems have been brought out, the copyright having expired, in a beautiful form, whereas under this Bill they would not have been accessible for thirty years to come. No case has been made out for this great extension, nor do I think it will operate as a rule to the advantage of authors. The authors will have sold their copyright to the publishers, who are the people really interested in this matter. I am well aware of the peculiar clause to which Lord Gorell referred, which disables an author from parting with his copyright for a longer period than his life and twenty-five years after his death. Whether that will or will not operate to the advantage of the author's family is, I think, doubtful, but it is a most extraordinary and freakish
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0030"/>
<col>51</col>
suggestion, and it is a going back upon all our usual principles of law in taking away from the author the command of his own property. The restraint is all the more peculiar because, though the author may not sell the copyright for more than twenty-five years after his death, he has power to dispose of it by will, and if he does not dispose of it by will it forms part of his personal estate, and as such I presume the value of the copyright, although unsaleable by himself, would be an asset which would come in, if necessary, in the sale of his estate for the payment of his debts. This is a clause which, I think, will require considerable examination if it is to be sustained at all. But the stronger case is, I think, against the extension of the copyright period to fifty years after death.<lb/>
My noble friend below me (Viscount Haldane) referred to the complaint of the publishers that they were burdened with the cost of supplying to the British Museum and the other privileged libraries copies of the books which they publish, but it is a burden, not on the publisher, but primarily on the author. It is part of the cost of production, and is so considered and taken into account by the publisher in the terms which he is willing to give to the author. It is as much a part of the cost of publication as the cost of printing and of paper, and to suggest, as the publishers do, that it runs into their profits is an entire misrepresentation of the real facts of the case. It is merely a burden which they pass on. It is a matter of argument whether the privilege possessed by the three Universities and by the library in Edinburgh should be extended to the new University of Wales, but it should be regarded, not as a tax put upon the publishers, but as a tax primarily put upon the authors. I do think attention has not been sufficiently directed to the extended term of copyright which this Bill proposes to enact, and I hope that before the next stage is reached some of the objections to the extension may be considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00254"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, merely rise to say that I am not quite sure that the noble Lord who has just sat down has quite accurately represented the case of the publishers. I do not think the publishers or the authors in the least object to supplying to the Universities a few copies <i>gratis</i> of all ordinary books&#x2014;those, that is to say, which are tolerably cheap. Their objection&#x2014;and I think it
<col>52</col>
is a substantial one&#x2014;applies to the exceptional case of books with a very limited sale and which are very expensive. Only to-day I saw the prospectus of a book which is about to be brought out by Messrs. Macmillan, "The Life of Emma, Lady Hamilton." Of this book 250 copies only are to be printed, costing thirty guineas each. It does seem rather hard to ask a publisher or author to supply free five books out of such a limited number. The Bill does, I think, appear to recognise that the present law is rather defective, because it provides that the copies for Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Dublin are to be supplied on application.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00255"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: That is the law now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00256"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: With respect to Wales, the case is not quite the same. In the case of Wales, under subsection (5) of Clause 15, the Board of Trade is to be allowed to make regulations as to the books of which copies are to be delivered. I believe the publishers would be perfectly content if the same power which is now going to be taken as regards the Welsh University was also given with respect to the other Universities. I believe the original intention of the law was that only such books should be supplied to the Universities as were really useful and intended for academic purposes; but, as a matter of fact, the Universities have agents in London who apply for every single book that is published. It cannot, I conceive, be seriously contended that such a book as the "Life of Emma, Lady Hamilton" is required for any academic purposes. I hope this matter will be considered in the Committee stage, because so far as I have been able to understand the publishers have a really solid grievance. Under this Bill publishers will have to give six copies <i>gratis</i> of all books. In this matter of free distribution we are more liberal than other countries. In no other country are publishers required to give more than three copies; in France, the United States, and some other countries they give two; and in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Norway, and other countries no free copies at all are given.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0010P0I0031"/>
<col>53</col>
Bill will see that there are points which must be carefully considered when we go into Committee upon this Bill. To those I should like to make one addition. Like other noble Lords who have spoken I am in this difficulty, that. the Bill having been taken in Grand Committee in the House of Commons there has not been the same publicity as is usually the ease when Bills are considered in Committee of the Whole House; and those who are interested in the subject to which I desire to draw attention are really not aware exactly of what did occur in Grand Committee.<lb/>
I desire to draw attention to Clause 5, in which the position of journalists and authors under a contract of service to a newspaper is dealt with in very drastic fashion. Clause 5 lays down that, subject to the provisions of this Act, the author of a work shall be the first owner of the copyright therein, provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"where the author was in the employment of some other person under a contract of service or apprenticeship and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person, the person by whom the author was employed shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, he the first owner of the copyright."</quote>
It is urged upon me that that will press very hardly on some journalists. In the first place, it scarcely seems fair that a man who happens to have an annual contract or a contract to write a couple of articles a week, or one article a week, should have no protection short of an agreement, while the man who writes a few casual articles for the same journal, not being under a contract, has protection. There is no question of the right of the proprietor indefinitely to republish the newspaper, magazine, or periodical containing the work. It is a question of republishing in quite distinct form, as in the case of a book of collected articles. If certain articles which a journalist has written in a newspaper are of such. general interest that, after a short period, they are reproduced in a more permanent form, it certainly would seem very hard that their author, who is probably superior to the casual contributor, should, as he had written them while under a contract of service, be debarred altogether by law, in the absence of a definite agreement, from any share in the profits.<lb/>
<col>54</col>
I urge this point on two grounds. One is that the practice as between newspaper proprietors and journalists has, I believe, been absolutely satisfactory in the past. Great consideration has been shown by newspaper proprietors in the case of works of journalists which are reproduced. The second ground is that I venture to believe that the provision in Clause 5 which safeguards the journalist where there is an agreement will really be nugatory in a great number of cases. There is hardly any man in the world so powerful as a newspaper proprietor, and it is, of course, an extreme assumption that a journalist entering upon an engagement should be in a position, before he has gained the confidence of the editor, to say that he must have an agreement safeguarding his rights in everything he wrote. I hope the noble Viscount will give his attention to this subject, which is of very wide interest, and will consider whether, by the introduction of some qualifying words, it is not possible to bring the two classes into harmony, and, without in any way injuring the interests of the proprietors, to make provision for doing by law that which by custom has hitherto obtained throughout the profession.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00275"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> rose to call attention to the following proposals reported to be in contemplation by the Government of India, viz.:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. The abolition of the offices of Director-General and Inspector-General in several departments of the Indian Administration, and more particularly the office of Director-General of Arch&#x00E6;ology.</li>
<li>2. The reduction of the Army in India.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00276">To inquire of the Secretary of State for India as to the policy of His Majesty's Government in these respects; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00277">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the Secretary of State is presently going to India in attendance upon the King on a mission which I venture to say has the sympathetic approval of every member of your Lordships' House and of the public., and this is the last occasion on which I shall have the opportunity of asking him any questions for a period of some months. I am sure, therefore, he will not grudge the demand that I shall make upon his attention, and also I am sure that he will be the last to deny, although this is a subject which may not excite much popular interest, the importance of the topics that I bring before him. In. my Question I allude to certain proposals which have
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0033"/>
<col>57</col>
been sent home by the Government of India&#x2014;in the first place, for the abolition of administrative posts in the Indian Government, and, secondly, it is believed, for a reduction of the Army in India. These proposals may be thought to be widely severed from each other and to have nothing in common, but as a matter of fact they have this common feature&#x2014;that both of them are believed to be dictated by the desire of the Government of India to practise certain economies in view of the financial situation with which they are faced. The main difficulty in the financial situation of India arises from the policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to the opium traffic between India and China. I am not concerned on the present occasion to criticise the principles of their policy. I believe there is a. good deal to be said for it, although I think I might without. unfairness criticise the manner in which in India that policy has been carried out. However, the fact remains that at no great distance of time the Government of India will be confronted with a. loss which I have heard put at as much as &#x00A3;3,000,000 a year. Simultaneously the Government of India have embarked upon a policy&#x2014;rightly, as hold&#x2014;which must be an expensive policy, with regard to education and sanitation in that country. Further, the increased cost of living in India must, I think, before long produce a demand, which it will be difficult to resist, for increased pay in the lower grades of the official hierarchy in that country. I imagine, broadly speaking, that this will be the justification offered by the Secretary of State for the policy that is being pursued.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00278">Yet, my Lords, if I may move for a moment on to a wider field of policy, I would ask the Secretary of State not to be too despondent about the finances of India. In my opinion those finances are in a thoroughly sound position, and I believe that with very little effort the revenues of India can be made equal to the maximum strain which the Secretary of State desires to place upon them without any recourse to heroic reductions of the character that I am discussing this afternoon. There have been during recent years great and beneficent reductions of taxation in India, and I do not believe that noble Lords opposite will disagree with me when I say that it can be demonstrated that at the present moment India is the most lightly
<col>58</col>
taxed of all the great countries of the world. I do not doubt that without any reimposition of the taxes which have been wisely taken off a considerable additional revenue might be procured in India by an increase of certain of the import duties which would be both popular and lucrative, and inflict no injury on any class of the population.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00279">But apart from that, which is, perhaps, not the question before us this afternoon, I should like to point out that there are sources of revenue in India which are expanding and are bound to expand. In spite of the more lenient standards of assessment which have been in force in recent years in the collection of land revenue, the increase in cultivation in India, and more particularly in the cultivation of lands irrigated by the State canals, must result in a considerable enhancement of the land value in the future. The railways in India, which used a few years ago to be on the wrong side of the balance-sheet, now result in a profit which last year contributed &#x00A3;2,000,000 to the expenditure of the Government of the country. The Forestry Department, to which I must turn later on, produced a surplus of &#x00A3;800,000. So strong is the position in India that there has been a great reduction in recent years both of the ordinary and the railway debt. If you look at the financial column in your newspapers you will find that the credit of the Government of India at this moment, although not equal to that of Great Britain and France, is as good as that of Germany, and is easily superior to that of Russia, Japan, Argentina, and Brazil. During the last ten years there has been accumulated an enormous saving, as much as &#x00A3;20,000,000 sterling, from the profits in the main of coinage, and although this reserve is held as a standard reserve to maintain the currency policy in that country, I think it will be generally admitted that it is an element of very great financial strength.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00280">I have merely made these observations by way of impressing upon you that there is no cause for alarm as regards the financial position in India. On the contrary, the Government of India can in all probability meet any loss that may be imposed upon it by the abolition of the opium trade with China without any drastic reduction either in the administration of Government or still more in the strength of the Army,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0034"/>
<col>59</col>
upon which you rely for the security of that country. I think, therefore, that it would be a great pity if, in any fit of temporary apprehension, the Government of India or the Secretary of State were to sanction reductions which might afterwards be found to be unnecessary or to be repented. One more observation before I pass on to the particular subjects referred to in lily Motion. The noble Viscount opposite, Lord Morley, has sometimes in this House spoken, I think, in rather disparaging terms of the doctrine of efficiency of administration in India as a doctrine of merely abstract and theoretical excellence, and has seemed to balance against it the tranquil contentment of the native population. My Lords, the two are absolutely identical. There is no contradiction or severance at all between them Efficiency of administration in India, and, indeed, in any Oriental country, is the sole guarantee for the welfare and the happiness of the people. With a weak and inefficient Administration you get bad and careless government, and with bad and careless government the effect is at once visible upon the lives, the security of property, and therefore, I need hardly add, on the happiness and contentment of the native peoples. I would sooner myself see a slight enhancement of taxation in India than I would see any general diminution of the standard of efficiency at which the administration has hitherto been maintained; and still more I think that any economy would be most dearly purchased if it were secured at the cost of any diminution in the security of the defences of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00281">The first part of my Motion relates to certain economies which it is, I understand, proposed to effect by the abolition of a number of posts in the Administration. I understand that the superior directing posts which the Government of India desires to abolish are seven in number&#x2014;the Director-General of Arch&#x00E9;ology, the Inspector-General of Forests, the Inspector-General of Agriculture, the Sanitary Commissioner with the Government of India, the Inspector-General of the Civil Veterinary Department, the Inspecting Officer of Cantonments, and the Inspector-General of Excise and Salt. Some of these posts were created in my time, and I suppose I may be regarded, therefore, as having a parental interest in them, but the remainder, I think the majority of them, were in existence in the Government of
<col>60</col>
India before I went there. One word, if I may be permitted. as to the reasons for the creation of these posts. I assure your Lordships it would be a great mistake to suppose that any of these offices were created from any desire on the part of the Central Government in India to interfere with the Provincial Governments, to arrogate to themselves excessive functions, or to indulge in a policy of centralisation. For my own part I think that a great deal of nonsense is talked about centralisation and decentralisation. People are apt to speak of them as though one was vicious in itself and the other embodied every virtue. The fact is, of course, there is no inherent virtue or vice in either. Centralisation is bad when the Central Government arrogates to itself functions or powers which can be discharged with equal capacity and knowledge by the Provincial Governments, but decentralisation is also bad when the Central Government has abandoned so much of its authority that the principles of which it is the recognised custodian in India have been lost sight of or confused in practice, or when the subordinate authority utilises the powers conferred upon it to lower the standard of administration. What you want in any Government. organised on the basis of India is the best division of labour between the two, and the real test is not how much of the powers is exercised at Calcutta or Simla or how much in the provincial capitals, but whether the division of labour between the two is so well adjusted as to produce the best effects in regard to civil administration and the contentment of the people at large.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00282">Then as to the second reason for the creation of these superior posts. In recent years the Government of India has made enormous administrative strides&#x2014;in education, in commerce, in sanitation, in railways, in everything. The Government of India is going ahead at almost railroad speed. We endeavour to approximate in India to, and we are willing to be judged by, the standards of the West. It is, or it was until recently, a very remarkable feature in Indian administration that while the standards of administration were constantly going up, the staff with which we had to cope with them and direct them was painfully inadequate to the purpose. How different it is in this country. Any Minister here who wants the advantage of the advice or authority of any expert, of the greatest
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0035"/>
<col>61</col>
expert in the land, has merely, so to speak, to touch a button and the man walks into his room and pieces before him all the resources of his infinite knowledge and experience. It is net so in India. In the Government of India we only have eight Cabinet Ministers and eight Departments of Government, broadly speaking, as compared with your fifteen or twenty here. Our Offices in India are not manned by officials who are there for a lifetime. The men are continually coming and going, coining up from the Provinces, passing through a term of service, and going back again. Accordingly, all these vast problems of administration have to be dealt with in India by officers relatively deficient in expert knowledge and experience. I will give you an illustration. When I went to India education was in the hands of an Under-Secretary in the Home Department. Conceive the sort of dismay that would be produced in the House of Commons if such a state of things obtained here. Arch&#x00E9;ology was in the hands of the Department of Revenue and Agriculture&#x0021; These officers did their work with amazing versatility and ability. I was often astonished at the soundness and the wisdom of their advice; but my Lords, they were not expert authorities, and in our readjustment the thing we had to do was to enable the Indian. Government to have at hand the expert authority and advice which would enable it to grapple with these difficult questions. That really was the main reason for the appointment of these high officers with whom it is now proposed to dispense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00283">Before dealing with the different posts in turn, I may, perhaps, point to a very significant fact. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, when he was Secretary of State, sent out to India a Commission to report to him upon the possibilities of decentralisation in that country. The proceedings of the Commission were contained in a large number of volumes, and the final Report [Cd. 4360] I now have in my hand. Chapter VIII of this Report is directed solely to the question of these Inspectors-General and Directors-General of whom I have been speaking, and I feel that my case will be immensely strengthened if your Lordships will allow me to read one or two words from this Report, remembering that they come from en authority that was sent out to India as far as possible to promote decentralisation, and therefore, where the situation might arise, to take
<col>62</col>
away from the powers of the Supreme Government. In Chapter VIII the Commissioners say&#x2014;
<quote>"An agency of this character [Imperial Inspectors and Directors-General] is necessary, but its existence should not bring about any greater degree of centralisation."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00284">Then they go on to define the proper functions of these officers, and finally they conclude by saying [p. 142]&#x2014;
<quote>"In short, there is a sphere of most useful work open to the Government of India specialists in helping all who have administrative responsibility but have not time for comparative study, and in keeping the Central and Provincial Governments apprised of the results of their inspections; but they should not be allowed to overshadow Provincial experts or to usurp the responsibility of Provincial authorities in matters relating to ordinary administration. On the other 'hand, the Provincial Governments should consult them fully and freely on any matter in which their advice may be of assistance."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00285">It is clear from this, therefore, that the Decentralisation Commission gave a vindication rather than a condemnation of these appointments, that they were generally convinced of their necessity, and that as a matter of fact they did not recommend the abolition of any single one among them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00286">Now I come to the seven cases to which I refer. I am not going to contend that all of them are of equal importance. That would be ridiculous. A much stronger case can be made out for the retention of some than of others. It may be that the abolition of one or two would be relatively harmless. My point is, while giving the Secretary of State an opportunity to explain, also respectfully to insist on the proposition that the abolition of certain among them would be fraught with very serious injury to the Administration. The first of these is the Director-General of Arch&#x00E6;ology. In the Commission's Report to which I have just referred not one word is said about this officer or Department. They evidently never even contemplated his possible abolition. No criticism even was offered of the work of the Archaeological Department. In fact, I have never met anybody who has criticised it unfavourably anywhere, and I believe there is no Department of the Indian Administration in modern times that has met with more frank and unanimous approval from all classes of the community in India than the Arch&#x00E6;ological Department. The people of India look with great reverence upon the monuments of the past, more especially
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0036"/>
<col>63</col>
if those monuments are of a religious character. They regarded with dismay the manner in which these monuments in India used to be converted to secular and profane purposes, and when the Department of Archaeology was reorganised and a competent scholar, Mr. Marshall, was brought from Europe to be put at the head of it, they welcomed his appointment and have given it their approval and support ever since. Only this morning I read in the columns of <i>The Times</i> a letter from an Indian gentleman, writing, I think, from Bombay, in which he pays a most remarkable and generous tribute to the work of the Archaeological Department in India and the impression produced by it on the native peoples.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00287">I am not going to repeat here all that I said in a letter a little while ago in opening this subject in <i>The Times</i>. I will summarise it in a few sentences. In 1899 the monuments of India, a continent nearly as large as Europe, were under the control of five officers only. The total amount of money spent in India on archaeological surveys was &#x00A3;7,000 per annum, and most of it went in salaries. The Local Governments were left to do much or little or nothing as they chose. Most of them did the latter. I see opposite me one very notable exception. I refer to the late Lieutenant-Governor of the Northern Provinces (Lord MacDonnell of Swinford), whose exertions for the conservation of the monuments under his charge were an example to the whole of the rest of India. Buildings were tumbling into decay, temples and mosques and tombs were turned into barracks, post offices, dwelling-houses, and bungalows. When the reorganisation of the Department took place Mr. Marshall was brought out to India. His operations have had a wonderful effect, and the history of the last nine years has been one of incessant activity. There is a saving that the Emperor Napoleon remarked that if all else were forgotten he would go down to posterity with his Code in his hand; and if our Government in India were to be expelled from that country to-morrow, I truly believe that it would be most fondly remembered, not. for its railways, or barracks, or hospitals, or educational institutions, its bridges, or its docks&#x2014;it would be more likely to be remembered by the great mass of the people for the reverent attention it had shown to their ancient buildings and memorials.</p>
<col>64</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00288">It would seem almost incredible that the Government of India should propose the abolition of such an office. So far as I know, there is not a newspaper in India that has not opposed this suggestion; there is not a Local Government in India that is in favour of it; and I doubt whether there is a single member of the Council of the Secretary of State who would support it. I believe the Secretary of State has had memorials addressed to him by something like ten of the learned societies in this country, and you have only to read the columns of the newspapers to see the number of authorities in India and elsewhere who have written on this matter. I said just now, and it was said in the House of Commons by the Under-Secretary two days ago, that economy was at the base of this proposed abolition; and yet I am not sure that economy would result, for I hear to-day that if this office is abolished it is proposed to set up in Calcutta an Oriental Institute which would be a very expensive thing, with a Professor of Archaeology at its head, who would receive a salary scarcely inferior to that of Mr. Marshall. If that be so, I cannot help asking the question, Why do the Government of India propose to abolish, for economy's sake, a post which is admittedly admirably filled, and then appoint at a scarcely inferior salary a man who obviously will not have had the experience of the present occupant of the office? And why, of all things in the world, should they place him at Calcutta, which is altogether outside the field of archi&#x00E6;ological work in India?</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00289">If it be said that the standards of efficient administration have been so firmly fixed that you can afford to dispense with this officer and that the Local Governments can do the work, I venture to differ. The Local Governments have not got men with the knowledge, training, and experience required. Archaeology is a science requiring the most careful study and investigation. I saw in some newspaper the suggestion that if the Government of India stepped aside private initiative might take their place. There is no such thing in India as private initiative in a matter of this sort. Private initiative has had opportunities for many years and has not lifted a little finger to help, and if you think you are going to fall back on private initiative you will have a disastrous disappointment. I will not labour this question of the Director-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0037"/>
<col>65</col>
General of Arch&#x00E6;ology because, although I have not the slightest reason for saying so, I rather suspect that the Secretary of State, who is a man of fine taste and culture, is secretly in agreement with me on the point. I have, as I say, no right to make that statement, but I shall be very disappointed indeed if his reply is not of a sympathetic character.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00290">The next post which it is proposed to abolish and which is really of considerable importance is that of the Inspector-General of Forests. The Forests Department in India is a branch of the Administration of which everybody connected with India is very proud. One-fourth of the whole of India is under its control. It has 300 officers and 15,000 subordinate officers. The Forests Department exists for the scientific conservation. of forest lands, for the preservation of the timber and fuel that is in them, for the preservation of the grazing lands of the people who live outside the forests, and for the utilization of the products of these areas for the enhancement of the revenues of the country. The control of the Department is in the hands of the local Administrations. Each has its own conservator, but the general policy is controlled by the Government of India, who are advised by a highly trained officer. The first of these officers was appointed in 1864, and the post has been held by a series of the most eminent men in Europe. You can understand that whereas in this country forestry does not convey very much to us, in a country like India it is of supreme importance. It is a very technical subject, and when proposals with regard to development come up to the Government of India your Lordships can understand how supremely important it is that the Government should have technical and expert authority to advise it. The Inspector-General does not guide the details of local administration, but he is the adviser of the Government of India on general policy. He visits all the provinces; and if a further testimony were required as to the necessity of the post, I might refer to the Report of Lord Morley's Commission, who [p. 110] say this&#x2014;
<quote>"We think that the inspection reports of the Inspector-General are of benefit both to the Government of India and Local Governments. The Government of India are responsible for the general forestry policy of the country and are
<col>66</col>
clearly entitled to know how this policy is being Carried out. At the same time it is to the advantage of Local Governments that the wide experience of the Inspector-General should be brought to bear on their local problems."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00291">That is a testimony upon which no words front me could improve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00292">The third post to which I must advert and which it is proposed to abolish is that of the Inspector-General of Agriculture. This office was created in my time, in 1901, and we appointed an excellent Bombay officer to the post. Considering the extent to which the population of India, more than 80 per cent., live by agriculture, and considering the enormous contribution which the land makes to the revenue of India, it was almost amazing to find how sparse were the efforts devoted in India to the application of science to agriculture. A wealthy American came to India, Mr. Phipps, and offered me &#x00A3;30,000 to do what I liked with for the benefit of the Indian people, and, acting upon the advice of those who knew much better than I did, I devoted it to the creation of a great Agricultural Institute at Pusa. This place was to become a home of scientific research. There was attached to it an experimental farm, and there was a college for the technical teaching of those whose life was going to be devoted to agriculture. We appointed this Inspector-General with a staff of experts round him. The whole of the provinces of India followed suit and started with research students and. experimental farms, tad during the seven or eight years for which this system has existed I venture to say that it has been of untold good to the country at large. Every year a Board of Agriculture assembles at the central spot, presided over by the Inspector-General, and there all the officers of the local Departments exchange their experience and arrange for common action. Here, again, it is unnecessary for me to defend this officer, because Lord Morley's Commission have done it. At pp. 116 and 117 they say&#x2014;
<quote>"There appears to be no unwillingness on the part of Local Governments to consult the Inspector-General on important matters, and, indeed, they seem fully to recognise the value of an independent expert opinion on agricultural questions. That the general relations are so satisfactory is, in our opinion, attributable largely to the proper recognition, on both sides, of the fact that the Inspector-General is purely an advisory officer in relation to Local Governments."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0038"/>
<col>67</col>
And later on they say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board appears to us an admirable device to insure co-operation and co-ordination, while at the same time minimising the risk of friction and misunderstanding."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00293">And yet this officer is going to be pushed into the tumbril, and, if the Secretary of State approves, his head, too, is going to be cut off. I venture to say that that would be a great mistake.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00294">I have not much time in which to deal with the remaining officers, and I can only in a few sentences refer to each. There are four more officers whom it is proposed to destroy. The first of these is the Sanitary Commissioner. I believe the Government of India want to spend a good deal more on sanitation in the near future. I think that would be a very good thing, but it would be a curious beginning to sweep away the head of the Department which is about to be improved. I need not state the case of the Sanitary Commissioner because it is stated in the Report of Lord Morley's Commission. This is what they say [p. 135]&#x2014;
<quote>"The functions of the Imperial Sanitary Commissioner were described as being to advise the Government of India upon sanitary and bacteriological questions, and to consult and confer with Local Governments and their sanitary officers on these matters, but he was not to be allowed to encroach in any respect on the administrative authority of the Local Govermnents and their officials. The Sanitary Commissioner is also in direct charge of the central bacteriological institute at Kasauli."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00295">And further on they say&#x2014;
<quote>"His functions in relation to the Provincial Governments should, we think, be of an advisory, and mainly of a technical, character; and his relations with them and with their officers should be regulated by the suggestions we have made in respect of the Imperial Inspectors-General as a class. Acting within these limitations, he should prove a very useful adviser to Local Governments as well as to the Government of India."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00296">I am quite prepared to rest my case upon that Report.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00297">Before I pass away from the Sanitary Commissioner, I might, perhaps, be allowed to mention an experience of my own. I met the other day a very responsible officer of a Local Government, and I asked him what he thought of the proposed abolition of these officers from the point of view of a Local Government. He was very much opposed to their abolition in each case. His experience had brought him particularly into contact with the
<col>68</col>
Sanitary Commissioner. Asked what he thought about that, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Local Governments have their own Sanitary Commissioners, but a Central Commissioner is very much wanted because he has greater knowledge and wider experience. The Government of India can afford to pay a better man than we can in the provinces."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00298">And then he gave me a rather interesting illustration. He took the case of malaria prevention, which is greatly under the notice of the Government of India at this time. He said that malaria prevention is not a provincial or local, but an Imperial problem; it could not be dealt with by local bodies; and he concluded by saying that he thought the abolition of this particular office would not only be inexpedient, but, to use his own words, "positively wicked."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00299">The other three offices which it is proposed to abolish arc those of the Inspector-General of the Civil Veterinary Department, of which I will only say that it is an immense Department of yearly increasing importance, because it has to look after the whole question of the breeding of cattle and the prevention of disease in cattle throughout India; the Inspector-General of Excise and Salt, who was created after my time, but a defence of whose appointment may also be found&#x2014;I will not quote it&#x2014;on p. 73 of the Report of Lord Morley's Commission; and the Inspecting Officer of Cantonments. This last officer was not mentioned by the members of this Commission at all, and if he is to go I am sure I do not know why.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00300">I have now dealt with the whole of the officers whom it is proposed to abolish. Their abolition would, as I have shown, be contrary to the Report of the Commissioners appointed by Lord Morley, and so far as I can see the saving made by the abolition would be very slight, while the effect upon the efficiency of administration would in some cases be serious. Now if there is one danger to which I think the Government of India is liable under our system, it is the danger of oscillation from one extreme to the other. One Government goes in strongly for efficiency of administration; then a period of reaction ensues. Posts are abolished, experience is sacrificed, money is said to be saved, and a reign of <i>laissez faire</i> begins. Then the pendulum swings back again. I am perfectly certain that if you abolish these posts now, the majority
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0039"/>
<col>69</col>
of them will have to be re-created later on. I submit that it is the function of the Secretary of State in this country, to prevent these oscillations, which are almost inevitable under such a system of government as ours, from being too violent, and to consider not merely the desire for economy for the moment but the wider interests of efficiency in administration as a whole.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00301">One other point before I pass from this question. I think something I said earlier will have shown the supreme importance to the Government of India, when it. wants to fill these expert offices, of being able to attract the highest class of man. You cannot get him in India. You therefore have to get him from England, and sometimes from Europe. We have been very successful in procuring that type of man, but if you create a number of these posts, if you declare them to be permanent and tempt a number of English or European gentlemen of great distinction to conic out and occupy them, and if von then suddenly sweep them away wit hunt notice and turn your officers adrift on the world, all I can say is that the Government of India will earn an unenviable reputation and you will not persuade the same class of men to come forward and fill your expert posts in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00302">I now come to the Indian Army. It is understood that the Government of India are likely to submit before long, if they have not already submitted, to the Secretary of State proposals for the reduction of the Army in India. I should say that I speak with no special knowledge on this subject and only from the evidence which is accessible to every one in the newspapers, from which I conclude that there is no doubt whatever that some such idea is on loot. It appears to have arisen as follows. In I he early part of the present year, in a debate in the Imperial Legislative Council at Calcutta, a Motion was submitted by a very prominent Indian gentleman, Mr. Gokhale, calling for a reduction of expenditure, and this Motion was for the time being disposed of by an offer on the part of the Finance Minister to appoint a Committee to consider the question of military expenditure in India. The Committee, I believe, has been sitting. Rumours of its probable findings have from time to time come out in the newspapers, and more than once the Under-Secretary in the House of Commons has
<col>70</col>
answered questions upon the subject, his answers leading to the conclusion that sonic reduction in the Army is certainly contemplation. The only consolation to be derived from his remarks has been that the reduction is not to apply to the British Army in India, but only to the Native Army.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00303">I do not for one moment blame the Government of India or the Secretary of State for having instituted an inquiry into civil and military expenditure in India. I think it is very good that such inquiries should lie held front time to time, and I rather regret t hey are not also sometimes held in the Parliament of this country. I am far from saying that the strength of the Army in India should be looked upon as a <i>res judicata</i>, as fixed for all time. It has been altered from Mite to time in the past. But I do say that if the alteration that is proposed is going to take the form of reduction, then it ought to be justified by the very strongest arguments. The reduction of the Army in India is not merely a local affair but an Imperial affair, affecting the whole resources of the Empire, and of all things in the world it ought not to be decided on financial considerations alone. Even from the fin racial point of view, if that is your point for the moment, you ought to consider very carefully, first., whether your economies, if you insist upon them, could not be otherwise effected, and I will show in a moment how I think they could be; and., secondly, even if they are effected in this particular way, whether they might not be more than counterbalanced by the resultant risks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00304">No doubt we shall be told by the noble Marquess the Secretary of State&#x2014;I hope he will forgive me for anticipating the possible nature of his reply&#x2014;that the reductions will consist solely of weeding out the inefficient elements in the Indian Army, and that the diminution in numbers will be more than compensated for by the increase in efficiency&#x2014;that although your Army will be numerically weaker it will yet be stronger than before. I am well aware of this ancient plea. It does not impress me in the least. It is the favourite argument of the economist when he is turned loose in a military department and has to reduce somehow or other. But however that may be in this country, the argument about reduced numbers and increased efficiency has less force in India than anywhere else; and for these reasons. In the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0040"/>
<col>71</col>
first place, in a country like India, with all its composite populations as the basis of your Army, you can never hope to recruit the whole of your Army on the same standard. You must always have a number of your regiments drawn from races and from elements in the population that are relatively inferior. Further, it must be remembered that in India the whole of your Army is not required for service in the field. When disturbance breaks out or war occurs you push up your martial regiments to the frontier, but your inferior regiments are kept in posts and cantonments all over the country to secure internal tranquility. One other consideration. You do not want to recruit your Army in India from one class only. I should like to impress upon noble Lords my conviction that one great element in the strength of our Army in India is not merely that it is a fighting force, but that it is a national force&#x2014;that is, a force dependent upon the contributions, and consequently upon the support, of the community at large. Therefore it is of vital importance to the Army that it should be recruited from all parts of that great Empire. In days of external trouble the efficient regiments will go to the frontier and across the frontier to hold up the flag of Great Britain against the enemy; but in the day of internal trouble the less efficient regiments will be almost equally useful in maintaining tranquility in the interior.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00305">There is one other respect in which I think I may anticipate the reply of the Secretary of State. He will tell me, no doubt, that the situation has changed in India; that the present strength of the Army was fixed with a view to a Russian invasion, and that with the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement such a danger has disappeared into the background. I admit that the tension on the frontier of India has been most happily relaxed, and that the chances of invasion have been proportionately reduced. I hope that that situation will be permanent, but I think it would be unwise to be absolutely confident about it. Anyhow I do not think there is anything in the alteration of the situation to render it desirable that the Government of India should seriously alter their policy as regards the strength of their armaments. Then there are counterbalancing factors which every one who knows India cannot help
<col>72</col>
bearing in mind. They are these. The whole of Afghanistan is now armed to an extent which would have been deemed incredible twenty years ago; and not merely Afghanistan but that great stretch of mountainous border between Afghanistan and India is now flooded with European rifles and modern ammunition, which have made their way up, as your Lordships know, from the Persian Gulf; and it cannot be dismissed as an idle dream that, should the opportunity occur at a time of internal commotion or public danger, these hereditary freebooters of the highlands on the frontier might again seize the opportunity of pouring down on the rich plains of the Punjab and taking again that which they regard as their legitimate spoil.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00306">I am not going to say anything about the internal condition of India, because that is rather a delicate subject. I hope the internal position of India is sensibly alleviated. I believe that it is, for the time being at any rate. But no one can doubt that there are elements existing below the service which can never be ignored and which might threaten our domestic tranquility in the future, and that in the event of war on the frontier, or still more in the event of disaster to British arms outside, an occasion might arise in which there would be serious trouble inside India itself. In view of these various considerations I would urge upon the Secretary of State, if he will allow me to do so, a policy of some caution and circumspection in dealing with this question of a proposed reduction of the Army in India; and I would remind him that on the few occasions when we have suddenly and substantially reduced the Army in India, apparently for good reasons, the step has been bitterly repented of and has had to be retraced at great cost. Above all, I would ask him, as he is now going out to India., where he will have an opportunity of consulting with the Viceroy and the officials of the Indian Government, to remember that a very important element in the maintenance of our rule in India is the contentment of the Native Army. The Native Army particularly dislikes any thing in the nature of change, and you have to look to the effect of a reduction in the Native Army not merely in your Budget for the next year and the years following, but in the sentiments of the troops. It is very little worth while to save a lot of money, to come out with a fine Budget, if the price you have to pay
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0041"/>
<col>73</col>
for that is a serious diminution in the confidence and contentment of the soldiers of your Native Army.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00307">I said just now that if the Secretary of State was looking out for military economies I would like to give him a little advice on the matter. I think there are other directions in which he might very well economise in military matters in India, but they would not be in a reduction of numerical strength so far as they would be in the simplification of administrative control. I rather wish that I was going out to India as A.D.C. to the noble Marquess. If I were engaged in that modest but honourable capacity, I would go up with him to Simla or take hint to Calcutta and penetrate into the administrative side of Army headquarters, and I venture to say that I could point out to him superfluous and overlapping offices and posts inside those departments. Ten men doing the work which could be done by five; their number might very opportunely be reduced without any suffering to anybody but the individuals concerned. In this way the noble Marquess might obtain the reductions he desires without any infringement of the security of our position in India and without any diminution of our native forces.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00310"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the beginning of his most interesting speech the noble Earl alluded in kind terms to the fact that I am shortly about to have the honour of going to India in attendance on the King, which will prevent my taking any further part in the business of the remainder of this Session. I can assure the noble Earl and the House that I feel deeply the honour of attending His Majesty on such a great and unique occasion, and I also feel what a singular advantage it is, an advantage which no Secretary of State has ever enjoyed before, to be able even within the short time that will be at my disposal to have an opportunity of consulting the Government of India on the spot, more especially as the Viceroy is an old friend of mine; our friendship goes back more than forty years, when we were contemporary schoolboys&#x2014;a friendship which has been maintained during that long period. He and I, therefore, can consult on many State matters with more ease than if we met there for the first time almost as strangers. I have no complaint whatever to make of the fact that the noble Earl has thought it right to introduce a debate dealing with these various matters; neither have I the faintest complaint to make of the manner in which he treated them, or of anything which fell from him in the course of his speech.<lb/>
I think, perhaps, it will be the most convenient course if I first say a. few words about the subject with which the noble Earl dealt in the latter part of his speech&#x2014;I mean the subject of the Army; because important though many of the topics are upon which he touched, that is by common consent the most important of any. The noble Earl has told us that his remarks were founded upon certain accounts or rumours which appeared in the public Press, not, as he pointed out, with complete accuracy, because they were afterwards authoritatively contradicted in so far as they dealt with some most alarming points, the most alarming being a contemplated reduction of the British Army in India, for which there never was an atom of foundation. It is quite true that in approaching the consideration of this matter the Government of India have borne in mind the general necessity which confronts them for the exercise of economy. They recognise, as the noble Earl very
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0042"/>
<col>75</col>
fairly pointed out, the growth of expenditure arising from improved administration of all kinds, and particularly the prospective growth which is bound to proceed from the call for improved sanitation all over India, and also the large and necessarily costly improvements in the education of the people.<lb/>
I am in entire agreement with the noble Earl that we ought not to talk of the financial future of India in terms of anything approaching despair. Quite the contrary. I adopt everything that he said on that point, and. I am very glad that, speaking with his great authority and long experience, he is able to take a not altogether unhopeful view of the future of Indian finance. But, as he also truly pointed out, the Government of India have to face the prospective loss of revenue front the policy which has been adopted, by common agreement in this country, with reference to the Chinese opium trade. It would be a waste of time for me to animadvert in any way to that policy. It is undoubtedly the declared and settled policy of this country that opium is not to be forced upon China if China states and shows that she does not want opium, and the Indian Government have accepted this as a fact. In consequence, my Lords, the Government of India have engaged in a general investigation into the various public Departments wit h a view to seeing what economies are or may be possible, and among those Departments the Department of the Army was naturally, and I venture to say rightly, included.<lb/>
It may be taken as an absolute axiom that in the pursuit of economy in matters of defence no sacrifice of safety against external attack or any risk of inability to preserve internal order can possibly be faced, and that applies not only to the numerical strength of your defensive force, but also to the maintenance of its efficient character. But, my Lords, that fact ought not to imply, and I believe does not imply, except in the case of a very few reckless people, that the cost of your national defence, whether by sea or land, is to be a matter of indifference to you. Take an analogy from civil life. We should all agree that in the last resort the most important civic expenditure upon which we could engage is that which insures us an efficient police force; and for this reason, that a state of complete anarchy which might be presumed to exist if there
<col>76</col>
were no police force would be an even worse thing than that sanitation should be neglected or education be altogether deficient. But that fact will never prevent people from grumbling at the police rate if they consider it unduly high. On the same principle, while fully admitting the axiom with regard to national defence which I have stated, it is not merely reasonable; but imperative even, to inquire into the scale and the merits of your expenditure. It is equally true&#x2014;and here I ant also in agreement with the noble Earl&#x2014;that it is a serious mistake, especially in the case of an Empire like India, with a great native Army, to be continually pulling up your plant to see how it is growing, or to make perpetual, small, and possibly fussy alterations in your policy.<lb/>
As regards the position in India, the present composition and distribution of the Army is founded on the proposals which started in the year 1903 and were finally applied in the year 1904, and it is quite unnecessary for me, speaking in this House, to pay any tribute either to the high authority or the great national services of Lord Kitchener. But since that time there have occurred those changes in relation to external policy to which the noble Earl alluded, although he rightly pointed out that too much emphasis must not be laid on the existence of an agreement or understanding which is the consequence of those changes, and although he admitted that a relief of tension might occur, as it has occurred on the North-Western Frontier, by their operation; and. of course, there is also the possibility of other external changes which are not of so favourable a character. It is also true that since 1903 there has been some change&#x2014;the noble Earl alluded to it as a subject of great delicacy&#x2014;as regards our internal position. In those years the internal state of India gave no anxiety. In some years following it caused grave and deep anxiety. Now, I am glad to be able to think and to say that we can regard the internal position of the country without anything which ought to be described as anxiety. The position must need, and will receive; all due watchfulness; but there is nothing now in the general temper, not merely of the people of India as a whole but of any race or section of the people of India, which ought to cause us anything which can be described by the word "anxiety."<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0043"/>
<col>77</col>
Those are the changes, very broadly described, which have occurred since 1903. The Government of India, therefore, think that it is reasonable to make some fresh and further inquiry into the whole military position. They regard, and rightly regard, the military position in India as a matter of Imperial concern, and they therefore do not desire on their own initiative to make such suggestions, still less to carry out such steps, as would be within their full competence to make or to take, without reference here. This they feel all the more because the question has been raised of the possibility of a certain reduction, to which the noble Earl alluded, of what may be considered as somewhat superfluous elements in the Indian Army. That being so, the Government of India ask, and the Military Department in India also ask, that they may be assisted in making this inquiry by a Committee, and they have asked that a very distinguished officer, Sir William Nicholson, should preside over that Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00312"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes. As your Lordships are aware, Sir William Nicholson has an Indian experience which is scarcely equalled by any senior officer of the day. He was its the Afghan War in 1878, and from that time down to 1899 he held high appointments, including the highest Staff appointment in India. Therefore there is little that he does not know about the Indian Army. He has been asked, and has agreed, to preside over this small Committee when his time of service as Chief of the Staff is up, which will be early in the spring, and he will therefore proceed to India for that purpose. He will be assisted by one or two other distinguished officers, and also by some gentleman who can be regarded as an expert in Indian military finance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00313"><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Does that mean that the matter is in abeyance until next spring?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00314"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes. No steps will be taken so far as a consideration of the whole military position is concerned until this Committee has reported; but, of course, I am not saying that the Government of India may not make some proposals with reference to their forthcoming Budget
<col>78</col>
proposals with which I am, as yet, unacquainted, and which may affect the Indian Army to some extent. I must guard myself against that, for, of course, I do not know that some proposal may not be made. But so far as the whole question is concerned, we shall wait until we hear that this Committee has reported. That is all I have to say on the subject of the Army.<lb/>
I pass on to the miscellaneous questions of the Inspectors-General with which the noble Earl dealt. It would not be accurate to say that the desire to cut down expenditure was the prime moving cause with the Government of India in making these proposals. They are, of course, glad, as any Administration would be, to save money on any post which can be regarded as superfluous, but the whole amount involved, as the noble Earl is well aware, is not by any means large, and even if the whole operation were to take place it could not be regarded in a very splendid effort in the cause of national economy. The Government of India, therefore, would not admit that their proposals involved anything like a deliberate sacrifice of efficiency for the sake of saving money. On the contrary, they object to the existence of these posts in themselves as not tending to efficiency as they understand it. The noble Earl alluded to the Report of the Decentralisation Commission, which was, however, only indirectly concerned with these offices in the sense that it was not so much called upon to consider whether such offices ought to exist as whether in fact they interfered prejudicially with the relations existing between the Supreme Government and tile Local Governments for financial and administrative purposes. But it is clear from the quotations which the noble Earl read that the Commission did not object on principle to the existence of these offices, and they certainly did not recommend their abolition. They did, however, make recommendations that the sphere of activity of these officers should be carefully defined and that they should be kept within that sphere.<lb/>
The noble Earl told us that some of these officers, though by no means the whole of the seven whom he mentioned, were appointed in his time, but he was anxious to make it clear that the appointment of those officers was not due to an excessive desire for centralisation in his
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0044"/>
<col>79</col>
mind, but that it was done in the interests of the proper division of labour between the Central and the Provincial Governments. I do not dispute that for a moment, but this has to be remembered that different men will always regard in a somewhat different way what that proper division of labour between the Central and Provincial Governments ought to be, and it is no imputation against the noble Earl to say that it is not surprising that he specially recognises the sort of services which these officers of the Central Government were able to perform. If the noble Earl will allow me to say so, he possesses in an almost unique degree those qualities which in the historic contest between the hare and the tortoise caused the hare to be the favourite in the race before it was run, combined with those opposing qualities which when the event actually took place caused the tortoise to be returned the winner. Or, to drop allegory, I would say this of the noble Earl, that I very much doubt if, since the palmy days of Mr. Gladstone, there has been any public man who combined so wide a range of interest in many subjects, and such an easy grasp of their general features, with so close and laborious attention to detail and the power of working out that detail. It is very natural that the noble Earl, possessing those qualities, should see great virtue in a system which would bring under his immediate notice, with ease and certainty through a central officer, the various features of provincial policy in a way which could hardly be brought otherwise; and, as I say, that fact conveys no imputation, as I trust the noble Earl will think, against himself.<lb/>
The intention, therefore, of these central inspecting or directing officers was that on the one side of their duties they should supply technical knowledge to the Government of India and to the Viceroy, and that on the other side they should facilitate the comparative study between province and province among the different provincial Administrations. Those were the declared objects of the appointment of these officers, but the objection that is taken to the actual working of the system is, in the first place, that, by supplying the Central Government with technical knowledge, you encourage it to immerse itself in detail, sometimes to the sacrifice of the general principles which it is everybody's desire that the Central Government should
<col>80</col>
enforce, and that the secretariat&#x2014;that branch of the Department specially concerned with the particular subject&#x2014;is therefore apt, through the influence of these central officers, to take up small points to the exclusion of large ones, with the result that a vast deal of minor correspondence is brought about and correspondence generally is multiplied. Another objection is that the existence of a central officer of this kind tempts the Supreme Government to aim at a uniformity of practice all over India, in parts of which the conditions are so entirely different, rather than encourage it to make an allowance of flexibility where conditions vary. And it is argued, in the third place, that although these gentlemen are called inspectors their functions are intended to be simply advisory; but it is contended that their advice is apt sometimes to harden into something which can hardly be distinguished from orders, and that thereby the sense of responsibility on the part of Provincial Governments is diminished and their work is not so well done. Those are the disadvantages which in practice the Government of India are of opinion follow the existence in certain cases of these Directors-General, although they fully admit that the arguments differ in strength for retention or abolition in particular cases; there are some whom they do not propose to abolish, and they maintain that the advantages which an Inspector-General can bring about can in most cases be attained by the system of provincial conferences, to which the noble Earl, in connection with one subject by the way, alluded favourably, but which he would not consider, I know, as taking the place of Inspectors-General as a class.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00315"><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Provincial conferences are specially dealt with and pointedly condemned by Lord Morley's Commission as an alternative to Inspectors-General.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00316"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I am quite aware of what the noble Earl says, but the noble Earl spoke with great favour of the meeting at Pusa of provincial representatives under the chairmanship of the Director-General, and to which he attached great value. Although the Government of India do not say so, because it is not their business to quote British instances, I suppose they would say that the system which they favoured would be something
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0045"/>
<col>81</col>
of the same kind as that which brings about the association of county councils in this country. Lord Belper is not in his place, but he would probably maintain that a great deal could be done by conference between local authorities which could not be done so favourably or well by a representative of the Local Government Board. I do not say that the analogy is in any way complete, but it is the kind of argument which I have no doubt the Government of India would desire to use.<lb/>
I will take the appointments in turn, and will first deal with those which it is proposed to give the Government of India leave to abolish. The first of those is the Inspecting Officer of Cantonments, who was first appointed in 1903. It was a temporary and tentative appointment. It is believed now by the military authorities in India, who do not desire to see a fresh appointment made, that the excellent standard which no doubt the Inspector-General did something to bring about can be maintained, and that, in fact, there is really no work for a fresh Inspector-General to do, and, so far as I know, no objection is taken to the lapsing of the appointment in any quarter either civil or military.<lb/>
The next appointment which I propose to agree with the Government of India might reasonably be abolished is that of the Inspector-General of Agriculture. The noble Earl told us that these Inspectors-General could not as a rule be obtained from the Indian service, but that it was an advantage to get men of large general experience from this country who would be able to take a wide view. Well, in this case the Inspector-General of Agriculture, whose term of office is now coming normally to an end, was an Indian officer and not a gentleman from England. Mr. Mollison, who was the Provincial Inspector of Bombay, was appointed to the post with the Government of India, and has filled it with the greatest efficiency and skill. But the Government of India hold now, and I think their arguments can be sustained, that the Provincial Directors and their staffs are fully competent to carry out the agricultural work in their respective areas. They also think that the institution at Pusa of which the noble Earl spoke can now supply all that is needed in the way of central advice and acquisition of general knowledge, and they think that I his is one of the cases&#x2014;and I find myself in agree-
<col>82</col>
ment with them&#x2014;in which the system of conferences between province and province ought to be able to do all that is required in the way of co-ordination of knowledge and of work.<lb/>
The third post which I have agreed with the Government of India might be abolished is that of the Inspector-General of the Civil Veterinary Department. There again the Provincial Departments have had good experience of which they made full use. There is a central Board of Veterinary Science which deals with the more recondite subjects in which veterinary surgeons are interested, and it is believed that that Board will be able to exercise all the functions which have been performed by the Inspector-General.<lb/>
I will now mention the offices in regard to which we do not find ourselves in agreement with the recommendations of the Government of India. First I take the post of the Director-General of Archaeology. The possible abolition of this post has, as your Lordships will have observed in the public Press, excited no little general interest, and, as the noble Earl stated, a number of scientific societies and bodies of great importance have approached us at the India Office to urge its retention. We all remember the claims to public gratitude established by the noble Earl himself by his services in this regard during the period of his Viceroyalty. Everybody will agree that he performed a great service in India by rescuing a number of very beautiful and interesting historical buildings from base uses, uses of the kind which he described. Of course there have been changes of opinion on that subject not only in India but here and in the change of opinion the noble Earl has been a worthy exponent. After all it is only the other day that here, in London, our most important national possession in the way of a lay monument&#x2014;the Tower of London&#x2014;was rescued from use for military purposes which interfered greatly, not only with its beauty, but with its historical interest. So, as I say, everybody will be grateful to the noble Earl for what he did in India in that respect, and I agree that he performed great service in initiating a system of provincial museums, a matter in which I know he took a deep personal interest, with a view to saving a great number of specimens of antiquity from dispersal and loss, and also on the ground that subjects of this kind of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0046"/>
<col>83</col>
local interest gain by not being removed too far from their original habitation.<lb/>
Then, as we know, the noble Earl did great work in India in respect to the restoration of buildings. As to that, as the noble Earl knows, there will always be among those interested in the subject two opposing schools of thought; there will always be some who set their faces against almost everything which can be described in any sense as restoration, while there are others who believe that restoration can be carefully and sympathetically carried out in a way that need not give offence to any taste. But although there may be differences of opinion as to what the noble Earl did in particular places, yet everybody will recognise the tremendous energy which he threw into these branches of his duty and the great success which in general attended his efforts. I am in general agreement with the view that it is impossible to regard archaeology as in any sense a provincial subject. In the first place no officer, from the highest to the lowest, is appointed to any post&#x2014;I am speaking of course of the ordinary service&#x2014;in respect of his knowledge of or interest in archaeology or any kindred science. That applies equally to the highest offices, and when the noble Earl was selected by the late Lord Salisbury to go to India, as Viceroy I think it would be exceedingly doubtful whether any attention was paid to his interest in these matters, in considering his great and obvious fitness for the appointment. It was a very fortunate thing for India and for everybody that the noble Earl happened to take the interest in them he did, but officers of all kinds, Inspectors-General and Commissioners, are not primarily, or indeed in ally degree, chosen for their offices on account of or with any reference to their interest in antiquities. Consequently this seems to me the one subject of all in which it is reasonable and even imperative to maintain some system of central advice. I am not prepared to pledge myself to the perpetual maintenance of the Department on its existing terms, but I have decided to retain it, and the Government of India have been so informed. I have no doubt that they will heartily agree in the decision at which we have arrived. But in saying this it would be most unfair to regard the Government of India, in desiring to take the action they have desired to take, as being in any way indifferent to the subject of arch&#x00E6;ology and to the maintenance of
<col>84</col>
the ancient monuments of India, or as being guilty of any trace of vandalism in this regard. They have obviously been actuated by the belief that the system in which the noble Earl is so much interested and which he carried out, for the care of monuments, could be proceeded with without detriment without this system of central control. I confess I take a different view, and taking that view have decided that it is necessary to retain the central department for advice, for general supervision, and for the collection of information in connection with arch&#x00E6;ology.<lb/>
Then as regards the Sanitary Commissioner; that case, as the noble Earl is aware, though I do not think he made it quite clear in his speech, is on a different footing from the others. In this case the proposal is not in any way to decentralise or provincialise; the proposal in this case is that instead of having a Director-General of Civil Medicine and a Director-General of Sanitation, to throw these offices once more under one head and to give the Director-General of Medicine full charge of sanitation. As to this I consider, with the agreement of the Indian Council that it is desirable to retain the Sanitary Commissioner, but as regards his precise relations with the Director-General of the Indian Medical Service I have asked the Government of India to reconsider the question with a view to coming to a decision as to what the actual relations ought to be. It has been found that the complete separation of sanitation and of medical research, which it comes to, from the practical and clinical side of medicine has created a great deal of difficulty, and has tended to make the research side unpopular with young men who wish to keep their general information alive. They say that it is necessary for them somehow to have the chance of watching the processes of applied science, and that if they have not the chance of so doing they are in no better position than if they were working in the laboratory of some maker of patent medicines or preparer of drugs in the form now so popular; they have not the chance of improving themselves in the general knowledge of their profession so long as research is carried on, as the tendency has been to carry it on, far away from the large hospitals and the means of studying cases. It is therefore desired that the clinical and the biological and sanitary sides should be brought closer together.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0047"/>
<col>85</col>
We think that is an argument that demands consideration, and we have therefore asked the Government of India to consider carefully what the relations of the Sanitary Commissioner as he exists ought to be with the Director-General of the Medical Service.<lb/>
Then, again, the Inspector-Generalship of Forestry has been the subject of correspondence in the Press. That is an old office dating back to 1864, but the arguments for its retention are not altogether so much on one side as might appear from reading much that has been written on the subject. That, I think, was pointed out in a letter to the Press from Lord Lamington, who urged that there were strong arguments for the abolition of the post. His intervention, no doubt is due to the fact that lie was Governor of Bombay, and Bombay and Madras, as the noble Earl knows, are not obliged to, and do not as a matter of fact, avail themselves of the services of the Inspector-General of Forests, but have a service of their own which they consider to be sufficient. One important duty of the Inspector-General has been to examine the working plans for the management of forests, plans of the deepest importance as regards the main-fence of forests as great revenue-producing concerns. The Government of India believe that if the Department of Inspector-General is allowed to continue, there will be a loss of initiative in the provincial Administrations in the management of their forests. I am not prepared to come to a hasty judgment on the question as to the management of these vast State properties, and have therefore asked the Government of India to reconsider the point in the light of such further information as they are able to collect, and that is one of the matters on which, no doubt, I shall have an opportunity of discussion with the Indian authorities when I go to India.<lb/>
The one remaining post is that of the Inspector-General of Excise and Salt. His retention, again, is a subject on which there has been a somewhat marked difference of opinion. The whole subject is intensely technical, and it is one which it would be useless, even if I were competent to do it, to discuss fully in this House. The object of the Government of India I and their argument for the abolition of this inspectorship are that it is their aim
<col>86</col>
to provincialise as far as possible, and perhaps ultimately to provincialise altogether, the Excise revenue, and in doing that all the responsibility for the details of Excise administration would be transferred to the provinces. On the other hand, it is argued that, however much you may succeed in doing this, it will always lie necessary, owing to the perplexity anti obscurity of the subject, for the Government of India to have technical and expert information at their command, and that it is desirable also that the various local governments should be able to command the services of an officer of this kind who possesses special technical knowledge. There are a number of problems of a doubtful character with regard to salt, which is one of the most important sources of revenue on which we have to depend in India. There is also a question of a different kind which has been raised for some time past, as to whether it would not be wise to include the supervision or inspection of the Customs among the duties of this officer. That being so, and this difference of opinion existing, I have asked the Government of India to allow this subject also to be referred back to them for further consideration, because obviously it is not one of extreme urgency, and I think it will gain by further examination and reflection.<lb/>
Those are all the various cases, and I hope the noble Earl will recognise and admit that we have done our best to consider them not in a perfunctory way, but with regard to the special claims and merits of each. We have, as the House will have recognised, been unable to form a definite and concrete opinion upon them all. We have been obliged to leave two over altogether, and to leave over one point in connection with a third. On the others we have been able to arrive at a definite conclusion. I thank the noble Earl for having afforded me an opportunity of stating to the House the course which, on this large and interesting subject, we have felt it our duty to take.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0010P0I0048"/>
<col>87</col>
both the Government of India and the Secretary of State will in this matter emulate the conduct of the slow-moving rather than the conduct of the rapid-moving of these two animals. I should have been more pleased if the noble Marquess had told us that no changes would be carried out until Sir William Nicholson had reported. I hope the Government will not drift in India into the habit which we have rather followed here in connection with important financial and military affairs of taking action first and then inquiring into the consequences of the action afterwards. That is <i>pessimi exempli.</i> I understand, however, that no fundamental changes will be immediately made; and although the noble Marquess could not guarantee that the Government of India would not make some minor changes in the forthcoming Budget, I would express the hope that those changes will be of a minor description and that nothing serious will be done until Sir William Nicholson has reported. Apart from the reasons to which Lord Curzon alluded, there is one other reason which I think is of great importance. I will not use the word danger&#x2014;that, perhaps, is an exaggerated term&#x2014;but great caution must be exercised in touching the native Army. It is a most delicate machine, and it is difficult for the wisest man to say exactly what effect would be produced in India by dealing with it in any way. The noble Marquess said, and we all heard his view with great pleasure, that there was now no cause for anxiety as to the internal affairs of India. I earnestly trust, however, that in considering the question of a reduction in the Indian Army too much reliance will not be placed on the existing situation of the moment. It is impossible, in dealing with the many important affairs of India, to foretell that, however quiet affairs may be now, there may not be in the course of two or three years cause for anxiety.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00320"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need only offer the fewest observations in reply. I have on my own behalf and on behalf of your Lordships to thank the noble Marquess for the full reply which he has given, and for the scrupulous care and fairness with which he went into the various subjects and with which also he seems to have considered the proposals of the Government of India when they came before him. I will not add anything on the military question to what has been just said by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. I know Sir William Nicholson well; I had the pleasure of serving with him in India he is a man of strong character and of the highest ability, and I think His Majesty's Government could not have selected a better officer to advise them on the subjects referred to. It is impossible for any of us now to prejudge what the nature, and still more what the results, of such an inquiry may he, but I earnestly endorse what Lord Cromer has said in regard to the Indian Army. I hope that full opportunity will be given to those interested in this country to consider any proposed changes before they are carried into effect, and that we shall not be put in the lamentable position of finding a reduction agreed upon which we can only criticise after it has taken place.<lb/>
With regard to the Director-General and Inspector-Generalships, I felt disposed, as the noble Marquess was proceeding with his remarks, to avail myself of the right which I claim in my Motion, and as the noble Marquess developed at sonic length the views of the Government of India about these Inspector-Generalships and Director-Generalships&#x2014;views with which I wholly disagree, and which I may say were completely thrown over by the Corn-mission appointed by Lord Morley&#x2014;I felt inclined to press my Motion for Papers, because I should like to have seen the document in which these rather surprising arguments were employed. But as he proceeded I found to my gratification that the noble Marquess had by no means been convinced of the soundness of the arguments, because in four of the seven cases alluded to he had refrained from accepting
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0049"/>
<col>89</col>
the advice offered him by the Government of India.<lb/>
Of the three posts which the Secretary of State has decided to concur with the Government of India in abolishing, I will only say that I regret the abolition of the Inspector-Generalship of Agriculture. I argued my case before; it is stated in the report of Lord Morley's Commission; and in view of the enormous development which lies before agriculture in India I should have thought that it would have been found, and I believe that one day it will be found, of great advantage to the Government of India to have an authority at hand who can advise them in this matter. But whatever regret I may feel at the decision on that point is more than compensated by my satisfaction at the retention of some of the other posts in which I am more particularly concerned.<lb/>
The decision of the Secretary of State with regard to Arch&#x00E6;ology will be warmly welcomed not only in this country but in India, where I do not think there is a dissentient voice on the matter. As to the Sanitary Commissioner, I am not surprised, in view of the large extension of the work of that Department, that the Secretary of State should have decided to retain this officer, and I warmly approve of the proposal to make careful inquiry into the adjustment of the relations of the Sanitary Commissioner with the Director-General of Medical Service. These inquiries from time to time require to be made and are essential to the working of the administration without friction. The Inspector-General of Forestry and the Inspector-General of Excise and Salt are also for the moment still in existence, because the Secretary of State has asked
<col>90</col>
the Government of India to reconsider their suggestions. Nothing can be better than that the Secretary of State should have an opportunity of discussing these matters when he is out in that country, and I hope that when he conics back we shall find that his consideration of them has led him to adopt with regard to them the same conclusion, as he has with regard to the Director-General of Arch&#x00E6;ology and the Sanitary Commissioner. I do not propose, in these circumstances, to press my Motion for Papers, and I thank the Secretary of State for the great attention he has given to the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MERCHANT SHIPPING (STEVEDORES AND<lb/> TRIMMERS) (No. 2) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00355" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00356">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00357"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill which I have the honour to present to your Lordships for Second Reading to-day is a very simple one, its object being to remove hardships which at present exist in regard to a certain section of the maritime population of this country&#x2014;namely, stevedores and trimmers. As the law at present stands, these persons have no way of arresting a ship in the event of their claims for wages not having been paid. It has been laid down by the Court that stevedores and trimmers have only to do with the cargo, and have nothing whatever to do with the ship. They cannot, therefore, arrest a ship, as can be done by tradesmen supplying goods or by members of the crew. Cases of hardship have been brought to the notice of the Government, especially in the case of foreign owned vessels the owners of which have no offices in this country and consequently cannot be sued in a British Court of law. It is to remove this difficulty that the Bill now before your Lordships has been framed it enables any person of the class I have mentioned to apply to a Judge for the arrest of the ship. I understand that Lord Gorell takes exception to the procedure under the Bill, and is anxious that the procedure should be through the Admiralty Courts. If the noble and learned Lord will formulate an Amendment on those lines I can assure him that it will receive the consideration of His Majesty's Government. I do not think it is necessary for me to say more in regard to the Bill, and it is with confidence that I submit it to your Lordships for Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00358">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Granard.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00359"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Amendment which I have suggested, and which has been referred to by the noble Earl, would afford some assistance in addition to that given by this Bill. The point is this. The Bill enables a Judge to order the arrest of a vessel, and that arrest can then&#x2014;I believe I am correct&#x2014;be enforced by means of the officers of the Board of Trade or in some such form as that. But it is not always possible to find the Judge
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0052"/>
<col>95</col>
at the moment that it is necessary to make the order for arrest, and therefore those who desire to proceed&#x2014;and this is really the point of the Bill&#x2014;against foreign vessels are not, perhaps, able to effect the arrest because of the difficulty in finding the person to make the order. Then, again, when a vessel has been arrested she can only, as I read the Bill, be released by an order of the Judge, and that may be difficult to get owing to the absence of the Judge. In the high Court, however, the Judge of the Admiralty Court is always accessible, and even in vacation time his duties are taken by one of the other Judges. This Bill, as I understand it, will enable proceedings to be taken, within proper limits, in the County Court, but the Judge of that particular County Court might not necessarily be in the town or place where the vessel was arrested, and the procedure might cause some little delay. Demurrage on a very large vessel is so serious that promptitude in releasing a ship arrested in respect of small claims, as they might be, for stowing and trimming cargo is of great importance. I therefore venture to suggest, and I have made the suggestion to the Department from which this Bill emanates, that it might be desirable to give a power to proceed also in the Admiralty Court. In the present state of things the Admiralty Court has jurisdiction to arrest a vessel in respect of necessaries. The noble Earl has pointed out that that does not include the right of persons in the position of stevedores and trimmers to proceed for work done on the cargo; but this is so analogous to necessaries that the suggestion occurs to one that the procedure of the Admiralty Court might be allowed to be put in force in support of these claims. The difficulties in regard to delay to which I have referred might then be overcome, as a warrant of arrest can always be obtained at the office without going to the Judge, and release effected in the same way. Therefore the kind of Amendment which I would venture to propose when the Bill goes into Committee would simply be that power should be given to enable persons who have claims of the character mentioned in the Bill to proceed, if they choose, in exactly the same way as anyone would proceed who was arresting a ship for necessaries.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00406"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill provides for the laying by the Pacific Cable Board of a direct cable between Sydney and New Zealand. At present communication between Australia and New Zealand has to go either by the Eastern Telegraph Company's line or via the Pacific Cable line which goes from Brisbane to Norfolk Island and south to Doubtless Bay in the north of New Zealand. If your Lordships give a Second Reading to this Bill the proposed line would protect the Pacific Cable Company's revenue from the inroads due to the competition of the Eastern Telegraph Company, and would complete the triangle of Norfolk Island, Australia, and New Zealand. It would also have the effect of saving the company about &#x00A3;6,000 a year in staff, in addition to any gain in revenue. The question of possible competition by wireless has been considered, but the risk is not regarded as serious. I should add that, though there was no obligation upon them to do so by the Act of 1901, the company, like all great
<col>100</col>
commercial companies, have made provision for a reserve fund and have put by annually a sum of &#x00A3;30,000. At present their reserve fund stands at between &#x00A3;250,000 and &#x00A3;300,000, and the sum of &#x00A3;155,000 would suffice to cover the cost of the new cable. All the Governments concerned in this undertaking&#x2014;namely, the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and New Zealand&#x2014;are most anxious that this scheme should be undertaken as soon as possible, and the question was raised at the Imperial Conference this year. The Government of this country are responsible for five-eighteenths of any sum which may be required for the repayment of the cost and other expenses of the original cable which was laid as the result of the Act of 1901, and a Vote is taken annually which comes to approximately &#x00A3;54,000 for these purposes, of which we receive back from the other Governments I have mentioned about &#x00A3;39,000, leaving us to pay about &#x00A3;15,000 per annum.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00420"><i>Because it is inexpedient to alter in a Private Bill the existing public legislation as is proposed by the said Clause A.</i></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00423"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I shall save your Lordships time if I endeavour in a few sentences to bring up to date what has happened since you discussed this matter on August 15 last. Your Lordships will remember that Lord Shaftesbury, on behalf of the Belfast Corporation, made a proposal which he trusted might lead to a compromise, and in the hope that negotiations might follow the debate was adjourned. Negotiations took place in Belfast after the adjournment of Parliament for the recess, and have been continued in London since your Lordships met again. I am sorry to say,
<col>102</col>
however, that they have resulted in no agreement&#x2014;that is to say, the railway companies have not been satisfied by any offer that the Belfast Corporation have felt justified in making to them. All I need say about the actual offer which was made to the railway companies is this, that it went a little further than the offer made in this House by the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, on behalf of the Corporation. I have seen the parties several times since the House reassembled, and I have become convinced of two things as far as my own opinion is of any value. I have become convinced that the offer of the Belfast Corporation as it now stands&#x2014;that is to say, in the clause which I hold in my hand&#x2014;is a reasonable one, and I desire to recommend your Lordships to accept that offer. But more than that I am convinced that the Belfast Corporation are not willing to extend that offer&#x2014;in fact, that if this offer is not accepted by your Lordships the result will be the loss of the Bill; and on public grounds I. should regret very much the loss of a Bill which has cost a great deal of money in its promotion, and which contains many useful provisions which have no connection whatever with the point now before your Lordships. In the circumstances I would ask Lord Welby, who was Chairman of the Committee which considered this Bill, to concur with me in recommending the House to adopt the insertion of this proposed clause as the decision of your Lordships in this matter. I understand that the noble Lord is prepared to concur with me in making that recommendation, and I understand that the noble Earl opposite who represents the Belfast Corporation is prepared to confirm what I am now saying as to his offer. I would suggest that the most convenient course would be that I should move the adjournment of this debate until Wednesday next, in order that the actual words of the clause may be printed and circulated. If the clause then meets with the approval of your Lordships I shall be prepared, on behalf of the noble Earl, who has to leave the country on duty, to move its insertion in the Bill, and in that way, if your Lordships accept the clause, the Bill will, I hope, be saved and receive the Royal Assent in due course.</membercontribution></p>

<col>103</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00425"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Committee to whom your Lordships referred this Bill had a very simple object before them. It was this. They endeavoured to put Belfast on the same footing exactly as the majority of other towns in Ireland. That was their object, neither more nor less; and they believed that the clause which they proposed for the purpose accomplished that object and no more. As the noble Earl has just stated, the consideration of the matter was postponed from August 15 last in order that an agreement between the parties might be arrived at, but, unfortunately, that has proved impossible. I admit, however, that the Corporation has made a concession of some but insufficient value. After hearing what the noble Earl said and being alive to the responsibility of the loss of the Bill, which might happen if the clause which your Lordships' Committee inserted were insisted upon, as far as I am concerned and much as I regret the loss of the clause I feel that the proper course to take is to defer to the advice of the Lord Chairman and insert in the Bill the clause which it is his intention to move. For that purpose the best plan would be to adjourn the debate in order that the clause may be printed and circulated and adequately considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00426"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad, as representing the Belfast Corporation, that the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees thinks that the offer made on behalf of the Corporation was a fair and reasonable one. The Belfast Corporation, as the noble Earl said, have done all they could since the adjournment to arrive at an agreement with the railway companies, but unfortunately, partly due, perhaps, to the generosity with which your Lordships' Committee treated the railway companies, they have been inclined to hold out for everything they could get. I have to thank the noble Earl the Lord Chairman for the view he has taken, and I feel confident that your Lordships will, when you have seen the proposed clause, adopt his suggestion and insert it in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00427"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervened in the debate on the last occasion from a public point of view. I was not interested on behalf of the Belfast Corporation or on behalf of the railway companies, but I was interested in securing that the questions of public
<col>104</col>
policy which are incorporated in the Acts should be properly considered, and that in the administration of the Acts no sort of violence should be brought to bear on one party or the other. I do not desire now to obtrude myself upon the debate further than to say that I regret that in the arrangements which may be come to these questions of public policy and of the inviolability of legislative provisions passed for public guidance stand in great danger of being forgotten. I think it would have been in the public interests if the whole question had been fully debated, and then your Lordships would have been in a better position to know what would have been suitable for the particular interests concerned and also for the wider interests of the State.</membercontribution></p>

I do not think I need say more by way of explanation than that the object of these drafting Amendments is to divide the clause into two subsections, the first dealing with banking or loan business, and the second with trading.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00494"><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: In speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill yesterday I suggested the desirability of adding a clause which would give power to a person having a claim which he could enforce under this Bill to make that claim, if he so desired, by means of proceedings in the Admiralty Court. I suggested that those proceedings, if the claimant chose to adopt them, might afford, perhaps, a more expeditious way of proceeding to arrest the vessel and also a more expeditious way of enabling that vessel to be released, and the new clause which I now propose carries that out. This work is almost on the same lines as necessaries supplied to the ship, and the Amendment would not affect the other provisions of the Bill, but would give another, and, as I think, a better remedy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00567"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member> moved to amend proviso (i) by inserting the words "literary or dramatic" after the word "work." The noble Earl said: This Amendment is not moved in any spirit hostile to the general provisions of this Bill, but it is felt that there are a certain class of persons who derive benefits under the Bill whose interests are not sufficiently safeguarded. I refer to the artistic class, whose interests cannot be defined in the same way as those of the literary or dramatic class. My Amendment will not in any way alter the spirit of the Bill, but will only except the operation of this proviso so far as the artistic class of people are concerned. People of artistic temperament are invariably bad people at business, and the words which I propose to insert will save them a considerable amount of
<col>116</col>
trouble and litigation. There are two classes of artistic persons who will derive benefit from this Amendment. There is, first of all, the distinguished artist, who is more capable of defending himself; and, secondly, that larger class of struggling artists who may find that, having made a reputation with one of their works, the result of their labour is pirated, and that the fees derived from such reproduction are being enjoyed by others. A picture is an entirely different class of subject from a play or a book. In the case of a long play or book, a paragraph, or a few paragraphs, or even a few pages, of the work do not necessarily give the whole story, whereas the person reproducing a picture would desire to take all the principal features of the picture, without which his reproduction would be valueless. It is for that reason that I ask your Lordships to exclude from the operation of this proviso the artistic class, as it is particularly difficult to define in the case of artists where fair dealing ends and unfair dealing begins.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00568">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>Page 2, line 29, after ("work ") insert ("literary or dramatic ").&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Malmesbury.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00569"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl's Amendment ought, I think, to have come in before the word "work," so that it would have read "any literary or dramatic work," but he has raised the point quite sufficiently for discussion. The point of the Amendment is to confine to literary and dramatic works the doctrine of fair dealing which has been laid down by the Courts, and not to extend it to pictures. That is founded on the hypothesis, first, that there ought not to be that right of fair criticism and fair dealing extended to pictures which has been extended to the other two; and, secondly, that the law is in a somewhat different position as regards literary and dramatic works from what it is as regards pictures. But the doctrine of fair dealing has not been specially confined by the Courts to literary and dramatic works. The Courts have never said that they refuse to extend the principle to pictures. The question has never arisen in regard to pictures in the same way as it has with regard to literary and dramatic works. The Courts have decided that in the case of literary and dramatic work it is not an infringement of copyright if, for example, you quote extracts in a review
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0063"/>
<col>117</col>
or in a book or essay, and it does not appear in principle that there ought to be any difference between that case and the case of a picture. Supposing somebody is writing about pictures and wishes to give a sketch of a particular picture. It does not seem proper that he should be restrained from doing, in the case of a picture, that which undoubtedly by law he is entitled to do in the case of other works. I do not think that it follows that there is really and in substance any difference between the two cases. The law of fair criticism and reproduction for the purposes of fair criticism is the work of the Courts, and I believe to-day it applies to pictures quite as much as to literary and dramatic works. All we propose to do is to declare that for the future the principle of fair dealing which the Courts have established is to be the law of the Code. We apply it to all works of this kind, including artistic works, first of all because we believe it to be the law at the. present time, and, secondly, because there is no reason in principle for distinguishing one from the other. I think if we were to try to make this distinction we should be introducing a new principle into the law and one which would not operate very justly. Therefore I hope the noble Earl will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00570"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member><membercontribution>: The object of my Amendment was to secure to artists the advantages which others might acquire by reproduction of the artists' works, and I am not altogether satisfied that artists are protected in this matter by the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00574"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REDESDALE</member> moved to insert the words "the copyright in which is not private property" after the word "craftsmanship" in proviso (iii), for the purpose of limiting the application of the provision to works the copyright in which is not private property.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00575">The noble Lord said: I represent the Imperial Arts League, which is composed of all the principal artists in the kingdom. They view with something like dismay the provisions of this Bill as it stands at present, which would certainly deprive them of a considerable proportion of their means of livelihood. More especially is this the case with sculptors. British art at the present moment certainly is not in a flourishing condition, and if this Bill passes as it is now the condition of artists, especially of sculptors, will be worse than it was before. Sculptors stand in an extremely bad position, because not only is there a less demand for their work, but their expenses are very high. Whereas the painter has his studio, his palette, his paints, and his paint brushes to provide, the sculptor has to buy marble, which sometimes turns out to be defective, and the work has to be done all over again; or he has to cast his work in bronze, and that, again, is a great expense. He has to pay heavy wages to his assistants, and altogether the sculptor stands in more need of the consideration of Parliament than any other craftsman an in the kingdom. If the noble Viscount would accept the Amendment which stands in my name it would go a long way towards removing the disabilities under which sculptors would be placed. I venture very humbly to ask the noble Viscount to consider my Amendment. It is one which would satisfy the artist, and I do not think it would bear hardly upon any other class. In France sculptors' rights are protected with regard to copyright. In Germany, I believe, the law is the same. The amount of gain that is made by reproducing the work of sculptors is something enormous. It has been reckoned that if the copyright of the great Memorial in the Mall were to be sold it would realise many thousands of pounds, and I heard one sculptor say that he would gladly give &#x00A3;10,000 for the copyright in order to reproduce postcards and other mementoes of this great Memorial, which has not only an artistic but an historic and sentimental value. The amount of money that has been made abroad in this way is
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0064"/>
<col>119</col>
enormous. The money made by reproduction, for instance, of the great Bismarck Memorial in Hamburg reached to thousands of pounds. British sculptors feel that they would have just cause for grievance if their position with regard to copyright were made worse than that of their <i>confr&#x00E9;res</i> abroad.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00577"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment of the noble Lord proposes to give an entirely new right. To this extent the Bill sympathises with it, that in Clause 1, with which we have just dealt, a new right is given up to a certain point. At present the law is that there is no copyright in reproductions in what is called the "flat" from works that are in the "round"&#x2014;that is to say, you can take a photograph or make a painting of a statue. That is the law at present. What is proposed by the Bill is to extend the right of the sculptor to that extent. For instance, a man may have made a sculpture and may have it in a private place, and we think that he should have the fruits of his design; but it is necessary that there should be some limitations upon that. There may be, for instance, a very beautiful design in a public place&#x2014;in Trafalgar Square, for instance&#x2014;which belongs to the nation, and you do not want it to be an infringement of copyright for anybody to make a sketch of that. Therefore we tried in framing the Bill to hit upon a just limitation of the general right that is introduced for the first time, giving copyright in reproductions in the "round" as against the, original creation in the "flat." Your Lordships will see. the way it is done by a reference to paragraph (iii) of Clause 2. It is there provided that the following acts shall not constitute an infringement of copyright:
<quote>"The making or publishing of paintings, drawings, engravings, or photographs of a work of sculpture or artistic craftsmanship, if permanently situate in a public place or building, or the making or publishing of paintings, drawings, engravings, or photographs (which are not in the nature of architectural drawings or plans) of any architectural work of art, or the making or publishing of photographs, of paintings, drawings, or engravings the copyright in which is not private property and which are situate in a public place or building the maintenance of which depends wholly or in part on public funds."</quote>
<col>120</col>
We think that where these works are in public places it would not be right to make a great extension of the present law which would deprive people of the power to sketch these things. That it may be so on the Continent is no reason why we should make a new law here giving these entirely new rights in such an extensive fashion. We can meet the noble Earl, however, to this extent. There is an Amendment on the Paper in the name of the noble Earl opposite, Lord Derby, which I am prepared to accept, which will go some way to meet the noble Lord's point. But I think it would be going a great deal too far to take away from the public the right which they now have to sketch, for instance, a statue in Trafalgar Square.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00578"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REDESDALE</member><membercontribution>: I wish to thank the noble Viscount for his courteous answer. I was well aware of what the noble Viscount said in regard to photographs and drawings in the "flat." That was considered by the Royal Commission of 1878, and a clause was drawn up in accordance with their Report which ran as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"If any work the subject of copyright under this Act forms part of any scene, the copying of such work, merely as forming part of such scene, shall not be deemed to be an infringement, of the copyright in such work, unless the special purpose for which the scene is represented is the copying of such work."</quote>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00579"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The Bill carries the protection under the law far further than it exists at the present time.

The Bill does give protection, and the only question is what are the restrictions which are necessary in the public interest. We have drawn the line at buildings and public places, subject to the qualification which I am prepared to accept as to places kept up mainly or in part by public funds.</membercontribution></p>

<col>121</col>
beyond what they enjoy under the present law; but surely we ought to consider the position that sculptors are in with reference to other persons who find protection under this Bill. If under certain circumstances reproductions by photograph or in other ways are made of large sculptural monuments in public places, and if large profits are made by those who take advantage of the new processes of reproduction, is it not fair to consider whether sculptors ought to be placed in this position, that the work of their brains is to be turned into money by other people, and that they should suffer certainly more than other artists who produce their work in a different manner. I do not wish to suggest that it is easy to frame a Bill which is perfectly fair to everyone, but I do think my noble friend has raised a serious point, and that it is, not quite fair to imagine that those representing the great art of sculpture in stone, marble, and bronze can be satisfied to remain in a position where the work of their brains can be turned into money by persons who reproduce their work.</membercontribution></p>

It is not intended, of course, that the author of the first school book taking a piece of literary work could dispute the right of any one else to publish a school work containing a similar passage, but the Amendment would prevent one set of publishers taking from books published under that section for the use of schools matters which amounted really to copying works which had already been published.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00591"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: The first Amendment which stands in my name deals with a matter of some practical importance, and it has been suggested to me that it is desirable that this new paragraph should be adopted for the convenience of all persons concerned. The new paragraph which I move to insert provides that the performance in public of any musical or dramatic work, except when the, right of public performance has been reserved by a notice on the title page of every copy of such work published, shall not constitute an infringement of copyright. This is the law at present, and has come to be so because of the extreme convenience of this provision, which my Amendment suggests should continue to be the law. Not so long ago copyright did not at all, under any circumstances, prevent the singing of a song which had been published, and when that copyright was granted many people naturally went on singing the song without knowing that they were doing wrong. Consequently persons who, at a penny reading or village entertainment, sang the song or played the piece of music which they had honestly purchased at the music shop found themselves, much to their surprise, exposed to very unpleasant proceedings. A system of blackmail sprang up, taxing innocent performers and worrying them a great deal, until at last the expedient was resorted to of requiring that the prohibition of reproduction should appear on the title page, after which any one who bought the piece of music was fully warned in the matter. The provision which I propose to insert simply requires that this prohibition of reproduction should be maintained in future by a notice being printed on the title page of the piece of music or song. I am aware that in the later clauses of the Bill it is provided that where any person innocently does that which I have been describing the owner of the copyright should only be entitled to an injunction or interdict. That allows the equity of protecting the innocent performer. But I
<col>124</col>
would submit to your Lordships that that provision is not very convenient in practice. It is not convenient because it leaves the performer, although not subject to the payment of damages, open to the unpleasant discovery that he has been innocently committing an offence and may be liable to be sued for an injunction to restrain him in the future. The clause is also an insufficient protection for the owner of the copyright, who can obtain no damages and has to assert his right by commencing proceedings. Therefore in the interests of the owner of the copyright as well as in the interests of the public at large, I submit that it would be more convenient to insert the provision contained in my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00593"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend has referred to what used to be a real grievance, but I hope to be able to show your Lordships that the grievance has largely ceased to exist, and that the remedy conferred for it by the Bill is more effective than the one which my noble friend proposes. He wishes to make it necessary that a notice should be placed on the title page of every copy of a musical or dramatic work if it is desired to retain the right of public performance. At one time it was very necessary to do something to save the position of people who, for instance, sang songs at penny readings in the country. There was an ingenious gentleman about the year 1870 who made a living&#x2014;some people said a very handsome living&#x2014;by buying up copyrights for very little indeed, and taking proceedings, and he was always safe because as the law then stood he recovered at least 40s. penalty and his costs, and he did very well. Eventually the Legislature interfered, and put in the clause to which my noble friend refers. That was in the Act of 1882. But, unfortunately, it did not do very much good, because it turned out that the composers of songs have very little to do with the details of printing and publishing, and sometimes the notice
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0067"/>
<col>125</col>
was put on and sometimes not, and consequently the unfortunate author found himself at times without any protection. Therefore the. Legislature took another course, and in 1888 did away with the minimum penalty of 40s. and costs, and left the owner of the copyright, in this case the gentleman who had bought it up, to get what he could out of the Courts, which, of course, looked more narrowly at the moral aspect of his claim. That has reduced the evil to a minimum. We propose to put that beyond doubt by subsection (2) of Clause 6, which provides that the costs of all parties in any proceedings in respect of infringement of copyright shall be in the absolute discretion of the Court, so that if any one brings these actions the Court will be very quick to deprive him of all his Costs, and I can conceive cases in which they might possibly make him pay costs. The Copyright Committee over which my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell presided, after very careful consideration of the matter, recommended the abolition of notice on the title page on the ground that it had occasioned more hardship than it gave advantage. The requirement of notice in the case of plays is entirely inconsistent with the International Convention on which this Bill is founded, which makes it a condition of mutual extension of benefits that this kind of formality should be done away with in our law of copyright. In the case of music the requirement is consistent with the old Berne Convention, but is inconsistent with the revised Convention at Berlin in 1908, and would necessitate reservation from the benefits of the Berlin Convention which we are little desirous of making. More than that, the requirement is rather ridiculous looked at from the international point of view. Suppose, for instance, that a foreign song or play comes over here and gets copyright, as it may do. If the notice were in French probably most people could read it, but there are other languages which people here may not be able to read; and the fact that we are extending copyright to foreign countries in exchange for benefits we receive from them makes the provision even more nugatory than it used to be. This requirement has never existed in most countries, and in most cases where it has existed it has been abolished. I think the real protection which my noble friend desires is the complete discretion over costs which is conferred by subsection (2) of Clause 6.</membercontribution></p>

The Committee felt it was important that there should be uniformity amongst the countries of the Union on this point, and if Great Britain were to dissent from this Article considerable difficulties would arise in relation to foreign composers who might in their own country not be compelled to put any notice on the songs or music published by them.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00610"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> moved as an Amendment that the term of copyright should be "forty-two years, or the life of the author and seven years, whichever period be the longer."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00611">The noble Lord said: The question I have now to submit to your Lordships' notice is one of very much greater importance than that with which I troubled you just now. Your Lordships are aware that under the existing law copyright is for a period of forty-two years or the life of the author and seven years after, whichever period be the longer. Instead of that, this Bill now proposes that copyright shall run for the life of the author and for fifty years after. That is a considerable change. I venture to submit that the burden of proof rather lies on those who advocate
<col>128</col>
this change than upon those who support the law as it stands, and with great respect I would say that the arguments which were produced by the noble Viscount on the Second Reading when I raised this question appeared to me to be insufficient to support the conclusion at which he had arrived. He rested his case for an alteration of the law on the hardship which the present law imposes on authors who do not command the ear of the public when they first write and do not get a reward for what they have written until, perhaps, late in life, or, indeed, not then, and on the fact that those who come after them and who might have derived benefit fail to do so because the copyright expired seven years after the authors death.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00612">I spoke at some length on the Second Reading of this Bill in supporting the law as it stands and in pointing out the extreme inconvenience to which the reading public of the future would be exposed if the change recommended by the Bill is introduced. The reading public of the future would be unable to find that access to literature which we and our fathers before us have enjoyed until a much longer period has elapsed. As illustrations of that I ventured, on the Second Reading, to point out that the works of Wordsworth, which went out of copyright soon after his death, and were published in a very fine edition by the noble Viscount the Leader of the House some twenty odd years ago, could not have been published until the year 1900 if the term of copyright in this Bill had been law. The works of Carlyle, which have been published and republished in many forms and editions, with valuable notes by different editors, could not have been published under the law as now proposed until 1931, fifty years after Carlyle's death. All the great works of these authors would be kept away from popular use for very long periods.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00613">The present law gives authors ample and sufficient return. The great authors of real literature rarely get repaid, and rarely will get repaid in money for what they publish; but I think the balance of convenience has been reached by the limits which now exist. One case occurs to my memory. My late friend Mr. Herbert Spencer at one time was on the point of suspending the publication of his books because he found no public sufficient to buy them to repay him the cost to which
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0069"/>
<col>129</col>
he was exposed in producing them, and if it had not been for the assistance of some friends, mainly from America, who rallied to him, the publication of his works would have been suspended. That suspension, of course, would not have been met by the present Bill, but Mr. Spencer illustrates in his career the non-necessity of the extension given by this Bill, because in later years his work obtained an ample circulation, and he was in very easy circumstances in consequence of the copyright he received from them. The effect of this Bill in the case of the works of Mr. Spencer would be that the copyright would remain unexhausted until the year 1951&#x2014;some forty years yet to run. I cannot pretend, with all respect to my friend, that it is desirable in the interests of philosophy, in the interests of culture, in the interests of education, that that copyright should be maintained as long as that. It is not desirable that books of that kind should remain locked up in one edition. Yet under this Bill the works of Mr. Spencer, for instance, would be locked up for forty years yet to come.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00614">There has been no real complaint on the part of authors. Except a theoretical complaint that copyright should not be restricted at all, I have never heard from authors any complaint of the limit as to copyright imposed by the present law; and in the interest of the diffusion of literature and of the popularity of books, it is not desirable that the copyright should be locked up for the period proposed in this clause. I therefore suggest falling back on the law as it now stands. The matter is one of the greatest importance. It has not, as far as I know, received adequate consideration in another place, and if your Lordships refuse to consider it here it may truly be said that this change. in the law will have been made without any consideration whatever.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00616"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend proposes to treat authors in a different way from that in which the law treats other people in respect of their property. The principle of our law in this country is that if you take a man's property for the public you
<col>130</col>
compensate him for it, and one does not see why that should not apply to works of genius just as much as to other forms of property. At all events I do not think your Lordships will be disposed to take this opportunity of making a somewhat dubious extension of any practice which may be alleged to exist in regard to other ' forms of property. A mail's copyrights may become, and often do become, of value just in the closing Years of his life. I have in mind one distinguished novelist whose works only became of value towards the end of his life, and it is obvious that forty-two years not only may be, but often has been, too short a lime in which to enable a man to reap the fruits of his genius. Seven years after his death is equally too short. My noble friend says that this matter was not adequately considered in another place, but I can assure him that the most minute consideration was given to this question, and the term in the Bill | was arrived at only after a great deal of discussion and negotiation.<lb/>
My noble friend proposes to apply to all works to which copyright extends the term for which copyright is now given under the existing law in respect of books. The terms of copyright are very various. They arise under different Statutes. For example, in the case of paintings, drawings, and photographs the term is not the same as it is in the case of books, and what has been sought is to find a uniform system. In practically every other country the term is the life of the author and a number of years which varies. Sometimes the term is over fifty years and sometimes it is under fifty years. But in all cases the term is more than we give; and in the view of His Majesty's Government the time has come when the author should be given a proper period in which to reap what is just as much his property as a holding in Consols&#x2014;the fruits of his brain. Everybody, I think, without exception who has given attention to copyright reform has advised a reform in the law in the direction in which this Bill proceeds. Indeed, in this matter my noble friend is <i>Athanasius contra mundum.</i><lb/>
The proposal of my noble friend is that we should adhere to the term of the existing law with regard to books. The effect of that, to tike one minor point, would be to perpetuate one great system of confusion which exists at the present
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0070"/>
<col>131</col>
time. Suppose a man has published a number of successive editions with material alterations. They all fall out of copyright under the existing law at different times, whereas under the change proposed to be made by this Bill they would all fall out of copyright at the same time. That is very desirable, because there have been notorious cases of persons republishing the earlier and imperfect editions of the works of distinguished authors who were unable to restrain them. For instance, there was a cheap edition of Darwin's "Origin of Species" foisted on the public as his work, whereas he had brought out a later and revised edition in respect of which alone he had power of restraint. The answer to my noble friend is that the International Convention of Berlin in 1908, after much discussion, thought life and fifty years was the best period, and that period is adopted by the majority of the members of the Union. We are not tied by that, but if the majority of the members of the Union take that term and are willing to give us that term, then it is desirable that we should extend the benefits so far as they are concerned. The only other material alternative put was life and thirty years, but that was open to the objection that in a considerable proportion of cases it may be shorter than the period of forty-two years already given.<lb/>
My noble friend says that life and fifty years is a long time, and that books may be withheld from the public. My answer is that they will not be withheld from the public. People are, on the whole, anxious to publish their works and get as much as they can for them, and they will bring them into publication as soon as they can. But, suppose there was an attempt to keep up the price at a monopoly figure, the Bill removes any danger by providing for the case of twenty-five years having expired from the author's death. After that period under a clause which comes later in the Bill, anybody may publish subject to paying a royalty&#x2014;that is to say, the absolute protection is only given for life and twenty-five years, and after that there is a Tight to a royalty for the remaining twenty-five years. Again, under Clause 4, if there were any improper withholding of a book from the public after the author's death there, is a power to apply to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which can authorise publication under proper conditions as to royalties, &amp;c.
<col>132</col>
Again, to prevent improper withholding by the publisher the Bill provides that the author cannot effectively part to a publisher with his right for more than twenty-five years after his death.<lb/>
Then it has been said that photographs and gramophone records ought not to have such a long period. They have not. Under the Bill it is confined to fifty years after the time of publication. Words-worth's works became popular after his death, or shortly before his death. What advantage to him would have been the period of forty-two years or seven years after death? The same is true of many authors. The Bill proceeds upon the footing that the term of life and fifty years is shown by the experience, not only of ourselves but of other nations, to be the fair term to give, and the Bill proceeds on the further footing of safeguarding any attempt to set up monopolies under cover of the right which it is proposed to confer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00617"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: The point raised in this Amendment formed the subject of anxious consideration by the Committee who inquired into this matter. The reason for inquiring into it with great care was that in Article 7 of the Convention, the, ratification of which is being looked forward to, there is this provision&#x2014;
<quote>" The term of protection granted by the present Convention shall include the life of the author and fifty years after his death,"</quote>
Then follow provisions in case that term should not be uniformly adopted, and also provisions about photographs and other works. On that, of course, the question arose, What should be recommended by the Committee so far as England was concerned? And a great deal of evidence was taken upon the subject, an epitome of which will be found set out in the Committee's Report. After hearing all the evidence we came to this conclusion&#x2014;
<quote>" We do not think that it would be prejudicial to the public interest to adopt the proposed term. and we think that it would tend to beneficial assistance in the development and progress of literature and art."</quote>
Evidence was given before us that the existence of copyright does not at the present day interfere with the publication of books in cheap editions when there is sufficient demand by the public for such editions. Therefore we came to the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0071"/>
<col>133</col>
conclusion to recommend the adoption of this period. It cannot be doubted that uniformity throughout the nations would be of great advantage in this question of the duration of copyright. An instance is mentioned in some of the papers of persons who may move their publishing works to a country where life and fifty years can be obtained, if they belong to a country in which no such length is forthcoming. Uniformity would avoid any attempts of that kind. Many countries had adopted this term before the Convention, and I understand from the evidence that Germany would, be ready to fall into line if England agreed upon this length of copyright. It undoubtedly was established before us that it would be an advantage if all the works of an author fell out of copyright and into the public domain at the same time. Moreover, fixing this length of period obviates early editions falling out of copyright and being copied while the later, revised, and more carefully considered edition by the same author is still within copyright, and may be prejudiced by the fact that copies have been issued of the earlier editions which are out of copyright. It is said that this length of period will militate against the ready publication of cheap books. At the present day authors have realised that they can appeal to an immense public if they publish a cheap edition, and they are only too glad to circulate that large edition and obtain the profits from it&#x2014;a state of things which was not so possible when the reading public was extremely limited; whereas with good books it is a long time before any real substantial profit is made in certain cases by the author, whose work may be heavy and learned and not readily and easily distributable. I venture to suggest that the period in the Bill, a period which has been arrived at after considerable discussion and which would, if it did not produce uniformity among the nations, have a tendency in that direction, is one which should be adhered to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00618"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to appear persistent, but I would remind the noble Viscount that Athanasius was generally supposed to be right in his controversy. It is no reproach to him, after all, that he was single-handed. I submit that the balance of argument is infavour of the position I have taken. As to the question whether this matter has
<col>134</col>
been sufficiently debated I would point out with great respect to the noble and learned Lord on the Cross Benches, that the evidence which his Committee received naturally and necessarily largely came from publishers and persons concerned with the propagation of books. The reading public, the public at large, cannot be summoned to defend their own interests in this matter, whereas authors and publishers are always on the spot to press their claim. The discussion of this matter in the other House took place under conditions not favourable to public consideration. The Bill was taken in Grand Committee, and we know very little of what happened. As to the question of getting rid of diverse terms of copyright, I suggest that you are extending the period of copyright unnecessarily far. The proposition to which my noble and learned friend below me (Lord Haldane) referred would have been a much fairer compromise. It is convenient, of course, that copyright should expire at the same tune. It is inadvisable that the first edit on of, say, the "Origin of Species" should be out of copyright while the later edition should be in copyright, and that the first edition should be published in popular form whilst the second and revised and corrected edition is not so accessible.<lb/>
I submit that it would have been sufficient if the copyright had been for the lifetime of the author and thirty years afterwards. In the great majority of cases that would be a considerable enlargement of the existing copyright, and would avoid the difficulty of copyrights running out at different periods. But I stand by the principle that there has really been no case made out for departing from the present term. My noble and learned friend said that publishers have learnt that it pays to issue cheap editions of books, but they have not learnt it as much as they might have done. My noble and learned friend will find that these cheap editions come out when the period of copyright is beginning to expire, and if you lengthen the period of copyright to fifty years after the death of the author the cheap editions will be deferred and the higher priced editions will still be maintained. I cannot help referring to the case of Wordsworth once more. My noble friend said that Wordsworth's popularity came after his death. I remember that Lord Macaulay said that had Wordsworth
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0072"/>
<col>135</col>
died in 1830 instead of 1850 there would have been collected at Cambridge alone as much money in support of a testimonial in honour of his memory as there was in the whole of England when he did die twenty years later; so that Wordsworth did achieve a large measure of popularity before his death. I will not press the Amendment at this stage, but I would urge upon my noble and learned friend in charge of the Bill the propriety of considering whether the period of fifty years should be reduced to thirty.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00642"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Viscount states the attitude of His Majesty's Government upon this Amendment I should like to put a point which occurs to me on this clause. As I understand it, the Bill gives a copyright in architectural drawings or designs for any building. Now supposing a municipal authority or an individual landowner employs an architect to build a house or some other building, perhaps a cottage, for which the architect is paid according, of course, to the percentage scale on the cost of the work, would the copyright in that design belong to the employer of the architect or to the architect himself? If it belongs to the employer of the architect, that is all I want. But if it belongs to the architect himself, would it be an infringement of the architect's copyright for the employer of the architect to build other cottages, for example, upon precisely the same design for which he has already paid; or would he have to pay further sums for that copyright? If he would have to pay further sums I must say that it is extremely hard on the employer of the architect, and I can hardly think it is intended by the Bill. Of course, the words "under a contract of service or apprenticeship" would not apply to an architect so employed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00643"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask what effect the word "salaried," if it is inserted, would have with regard to newspaper work. A newspaper correspondent sent to a distant country is probably paid, not a salary, but a lump sum for his work. If that work is not to be the copyright of the newspaper it would be very hard on that newspaper.</membercontribution></p>
<col>138</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00644"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: This discussion shows the difficulties, and perhaps I had better first state what we conceive to be the law on the subject. The principle of the clause is that the author retains his copyright unless he has agreed to part with it, subject to certain exceptional cases. Subsection (<i>b</i>) of Clause 5 says that&#x2014;
<quote>"where the author was in the employment of some other person under a contract of service or apprenticeship and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person, the person by whom the author was employed shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, be the first owner of the copyright."</quote>
Unless there is an agreement to the contrary the author retains the copyright subject to this, that certain exceptional cases have to be provided for. The ordinary case of service is clear enough. It is where there is a contract of service and what the man does is for his employer. The fruits of the work belong to the employer. A man employs somebody regularly to make designs for him. or employs him in particular work to give his time to making designs. That is a relationship of master and servant, and in that case the design belongs to the employer. The case which the noble Lord opposite (Lord Montagu) has put is the case of the writer of an article for a newspaper. Where the writer is in the regular employment of the journal and has written the article for the journal, then the article, of course, belongs to the journal for which he has written it. If, on the other hand, somebody takes an article to a newspaper and asks whether they will accept it, and they say "Yes, we will give you five guineas for it," then unless the proprietor stipulates for the copyright he does not get it. I think that is pretty clear.<lb/>
As to Lord Malmesbury's Amendment, I think it is very doubtful whether it is expedient to put in the word "salaried." A man may be employed in what is a strict contract; of service but for a lump sum. There it would be very wrong to restrict the case by the word "salaried." The noble Viscount opposite has put that very case. I am not prepared to answer off-hand whether the relation of employer and employed would arise in every case which he has put. If the owner of a property were to employ an architect on the terms that the architect was entering into a contract to fulfil an employment for him in preparing designs for an estate,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0074"/>
<col>139</col>
and if the contract was that the relation was to be that of employer and employed, then the design would belong to the employer, and the employer would be entitled to use it as he thought fit for building other cottages subsequently. But I can conceive a great many cases in which that is not the true relationship. Some one goes to an eminent architect and asks him for a design, which he gets and for which he pays a fee. The, copyright in that case rests with the designer unless he has chosen to part with it on express terms to the person for whom he has made it. I think that is the line of demarcation. This Bill proposes to clear up what has been a rather obscure state of the law. The noble and learned Earl who sits opposite, I dare say, remembers the controversy that arose in the Courts over the case where somebody wrote a memoir of Lord Beaconsfield for <i>The Times</i> and that paper claimed the copyright and did not get it. There was another case in which reporters were employed for the <i>Law Journal</i> to report cases in the Law Courts and were paid fees for their work. It was there held that there was a contract of service and that the copyright had passed to the <i>Law Journal.</i> It is impossible to lay down in a definition clause anything which will cover all cases.<lb/>
What the Bill does is to lay down a very simple principle: first of all, that when a man produces anything that can be the subject of copyright he is to get the copyright unless he expressly parts with it. To that principle an exception is made when the true relationship between him and the person for whom he has produced it is one of service; when that relationship exists he does not get the copyright. Of course, when one has one's photograph taken one does not intend that the photographer should place it in all his windows. The copyright remains with the person who commissioned the photographer to produce the photograph. But subject to the case of service the broad principle is that the author retains the copyright unless he has expressly parted with it. I have answered the questions put to me to the best of my ability. I would only repeat that it is not possible to lay down anything which will cover all cases that may be put until and unless you know the exact facts of those cases, and whether the relation of employer and employed has arisen in them. The introduction of the
<col>140</col>
word "salaried" is not a true test of whether that relationship exists.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00645"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has made a very instructive speech, but I could not quite see that he answered the point which was put to him by the noble Viscount on the Front Opposition Bench. Lord St. Aldwyn's point was this. If an architect is employed for the purpose of building a cottage, would the person who employed him be able to build more cottages of that sort? The architect having gone and the original matter having terminated, would he be able to build more cottages of that sort without infringing the copyright of the architect?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00646"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I said I doubted it. I think the case which the noble Earl has put is one where no contract of service exists, and where, in order to get the right referred to, the employer would have to say, "I want this design for myself so that I can reproduce it."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00647"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Surely a contract of service could not be interpreted to exist between the employer of an architect and the architect. where the architect is a salaried servant of the employer, then, of course, there would be a contract of service; but I would impress on the noble Viscount that it would not be fair that there should remain to the architect in such a case as I have put a copyright in his plans. Take this case. A municipality may want to build a large number of houses of a certain plan, and perhaps may desire to erect a few to begin with to see how they work out, and it may be some time before they proceed with the erection of similar houses. Yet for all that time the architect whom they had employed on one occasion only would have a copyright against them on designs for which they had paid every penny to which the architect was entitled. He had been employed in the work, had received his percentage on the cost, and yet he would retain this hold on the plans. It is like what is sometimes attempted by house agents in London and elsewhere. When they have introduced a lessee to a landlord they, of course, receive their commission on the first lease, and some of them will occasionally attempt to charge a commission if that lease is renewed. This is on all fours with such a proceeding as that; it is evidently unfair. I would suggest
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0075"/>
<col>141</col>
that the word "employment" should be inserted, so that it would read "contract of employment, service, or apprenticeship," and then, unless there was an agreement to the contrary, the copyright would be with the employer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00648"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: What the noble Viscount says is true in such a case. Copyright is given to architects here and to a great many other people who have not got it now. The result will be that everybody in dealing with these cases will write a letter and say, "I want you to give me a design to be my design, the copyright to be mine to use as I please." That is undoubtedly what will be done in these cases. It is true that before this is thoroughly understood people who are negligent will get themselves into trouble by neglecting that precaution, but I do not think it will happen often. But it is better to leave them to take the precaution than to give up the immense advantage which the Bill confers of bringing architectural designs under the law of copyright. To my mind it would he a great evil to deprive the designs of architects of the protection which the Bill gives to the work of other authors. The word "employment," which the noble Viscount proposes, does not, as far as I can see, carry the matter any further. The whole point is to get the relation of employer and employed, and I doubt very much whether you do get that relation if you employ an architect for a fee to furnish you with a design. It, docs not create the relation of the one person doing the work for the other as his agent that is required to bring the exception into operation, and I doubt very much whether, unless the word "employment" were to be construed as to include every case in which a man paid another to do a piece of work, it would really help matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00649"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Viscount does not see much difference between the value of the two words "employment" and "service" I rather hope he will accept the word "employment," because it seems to us the wider word of the two. Is it not possible to conceive a case&#x2014;a case such, for example, as that suggested by Lord St. Aldwyn&#x2014;where the person who prepared a design might be in your employment but could scarcely be said to be in your service?</membercontribution></p>
<col>142</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00650"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Let me put the other side. Take the case of a journalist, who writes, perhaps, a rather brilliant article. He is habitually employed, we will say, by one of the great papers. They say, "We should like an article on such and such a subject," and he says, "Yes, I will write it for you." He is in the popular sense employed to write that article, but if this Amendment were inserted he would lose the copyright. That is just what we do not want him to do. The noble Marquess will see the difficulty. I think the better course will be this, that I should undertake between now and the Report stage to have this very carefully looked into to see whether something wider than the word "service" can be used or whether the word "employment" can be safely inserted. But, of course, I cannot give any indication of what my frame of mind will then be.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00655"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member> moved to amend paragraph (<i>b</i>). after the word "person" ["and the work was made in the course of his employment by that person"], by inserting the words "or where a work was ordered
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0076"/>
<col>143</col>
by some other person and made for valuable consideration in pursuance of that order." The noble and learned Lord said: The object of this Amendment is to deal with cases where a work is ordered and valuable consideration is given for it&#x2014;that is to say, to deal with other than cases of mere service or apprenticeship. Several cases can be suggested which bear upon this point. The first proviso in this clause enacts that where in the case of an engraving, photograph, or portrait the plate or other original was ordered by some other person and was made for valuable consideration in pursuance of that order, then, in the absence of any agreement, to the contrary, the person by whom such plate or other original was ordered shall be the first owner of the copyright. There are many cases, it seems to me, where it would not be right to describe what has taken place as work done under a contract, of service or employment, and yet it is work which is, in fact, bought and paid for, and is analogous to some of the exceptions mentioned in proviso (<i>a</i>). For instance, proviso (<i>a</i>) deals with a portrait, but does not deal with a bust. A person may order a bust and pay value for it. Yet the clause as at present worded would leave the copyright with the artist unless there was an agreement to the contrary. This would apply to other kinds of work, such as the painting of your house or your horse, where the artist is employed on commission. Then there is the case of a book of an educational character where the materials are provided more or less by the person who orders the work, which is simply done on commission and paid for. Those would be at present outside the. scope of these two provisos. If your Lordships will look at the proviso in subsection (2), which proviso I understand Lord Courtney proposes to move to omit, you will see that it provides that the author of a work who is the first owner of the copyright is unable to dispose of his copyright in the work beyond the expiration of twenty-five years after his death. The last twenty-five years, as I understand this proviso, can only be disposed of by will. A person who would acquire a copyright in the way this Amendment would effect would not necessarily be in that position. The Amendment would have the effect, in cases where a person really bought and paid for some thing done on his own order, of providing that that person should obtain the benefit of the copyright to its full extent. There
<col>144</col>
fore I venture to suggest that this Amendment is deserving of consideration, and that its object would be beneficial to authors because it would enlarge the exceptions in the proviso and enable them to have a better power of disposition if they were employed and paid by the order than they would have under this Bill.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00657"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know that the argument of my noble and learned friend at the conclusion of his speech will commend this Amendment to your Lordships. The proviso to which he referred says that where the author of a work is the first owner of the copyright, which he has for his life and fifty years afterwards, ho cannot assign it to another person for more than twenty-live years after his death, and then the copyright reverts to his legal personal representatives. As a rule in practice he can get just as much for life and twenty-five years as for life and fifty years. But my noble and learned friend's Amendment would relieve the author from the protection which it is sought to give him. And for whose benefit? For the benefit of his employer, who has not put any literary skill or artistic gift into the production which is protected. If anybody is deserving of attention here it is the author himself, and it anybody is open to the criticisms of my noble friend who sits behind me (Lord Courtney) it is the person who is not the author at all but who, by becoming the first owner under Lord Gorell's Amendment, has bean able to make an extension of the power to assign the copyright beyond what the law allows in the person of the author. Therefore I think my noble and learned friend has disclosed a serious morass into which his Amendment would lead us if we followed his guidance.<lb/>
What my noble and learned friend proposes to do is to put literary work on the same footing as photographs, for instance. The scheme of the Bill is to divide works which acquire copyright into different classes. In the case of the author we protect him by saying, "You are generally rather weakly fenced round when you are dealing with a skilled man of business, and therefore unless you part with the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0077"/>
<col>145</col>
copyright expressly the copyright shall be yours. My noble, friend proposes to repeal that, and to say that wherever anybody is employed by some other person and paid for the work then the copyright is to be in the person with whom he entered into that contract. That seems to me to be extremely hard upon a. great many people. It is very hard, for instance, on the author of a play who has been commissioned to write it for the purpose, say, of a particular theatre, and for a particular run, with no thought of parting with his dramatic copyright. It is very hard in the ease of numerous people who are not in the regular service of newspapers, and who are commissioned to produce articles because they possess great skill in doing so, but who, by this Amendment, would be prevented afterwards from re-publishing them in a volume. It seems to me that the balance of advantage is all against the Amendment of my noble and learned friend if the principle is to be that the author keeps his copyright in literary work unless he has expressly parted with it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00659">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00660"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> moved to add at the end of the clause the following proviso&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this section shall be held to deprive the author of any rights in respect of the re-publication of his contributions to a newspaper, magazine, or similar periodical in a book or in any other from distinct from such newspaper, magazine, or similar periodical."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00661">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I hope I may be a little more successful than some noble Lords have been in appealing to the noble Viscount to reconsider the position which has been taken up on this point. The noble Viscount a few moments ago said that an effort was made by this Bill to clear up the law on a point on which it had been doubtful, and he more especially, I think, alluded to the point which I venture to bring forward. I believe that the clearing up of the law in the sense in which the noble Viscount proposes to clear it up will cause astonishment and almost consternation among a very large body of journalists. The question of the working of this clause has been carefully considered by the Institute of Journalists, which, as the noble Viscount probably
<col>146</col>
knows, is a corporate body representing between 2,000 and 3,000 men in the journalistic profession.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00662">I do not wish to put the point too high. I do not say that this clause changes the law as it at present exists. If I did so, I should probably be met by those who have much higher legal experience than I have and be told that the law has always been that the proprietor rather than the journalist, the contributor, is the owner of the copyright. I believe that I shall be correct in saying that even that contention is open to some modification. I came across a statement in regard to this put forward in Shortt's work, "The Law relating to Works of Literature and Art" [2nd Edition, 1881]. That work cites a statement by Mr. Justice Maule, in which, with some reservation, he states that&#x2014;
<quote>"where a man employs another to write an article, or to do anything else for him, unless there is something in the surrounding circumstances or in the course of dealing between the parties to require. a different construction, in the absence of a special agreement to the contrary &#x2026; the copyright therein shall belong to the employer&#x2014;"</quote>
But Mr. Justice Maule went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"subject, of course, to the limitation pointed out in the I8th section of this Act."</quote>
The Act referred to is the Copyright Law Amendment Act, 1812. Section 18 contains one very remarkable exception. It execpts the case of essays, articles or portions first published in reviews, magazines or other periodical works after a term of twenty-eight years, and enacts that the right of publishing the same in a separate form is to revert to the author. Therefore although for the moment it gives the right apparently to the proprietor the Act; does, after a period of years, reserve to the author and not to the proprietor the right of republication. Then, again, there is another proviso that&#x2014;
<quote>"nothing herein contained shall alter or affect the right of any person Who shall have been or who shall be so employed as aforesaid to publish any such his composition in a separate form who by any contract express or implied may have reserved or may hereafter reserve to himself such right."</quote>
The words "express or implied" would, I suppose, even refer to a conversation, or to something at all events far less definite than a covenant or contract such as is contemplated by this Bill. All I desire to establish from that is that this question of republishing rights in con-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0078"/>
<col>147</col>
tributions Certainly has been in the past very different from the elementary law as between master and servant, and practically the elementary law as between master and servant is that which is established by the clause we have now under discussion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00663">I would venture to put two arguments to the noble Viscount on that. First, that if the law has been on the side of the proprietor in the past the undoubted practice has been that the proprietor should in all cases consult the author before republication. So much is that believed to be the case that even in such an authoritative work as Chambers' Encyclop&#x00E6;dia I find this statement&#x2014;
<quote>"The copyright of articles contributed for and included in encyclop&#x00E6;dias, magazines, reviews, or other periodical works &#x2026; being paid for and assigned, belongs to the publisher, but ho cannot publish them separately without the consent of the author."</quote>
I do not say that that contention has the force of law, but it is obvious that that has been the belief founded on practice, which practice must now become a nullity so far as the law is concerned if this clause passes in its present form.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00664">The case for asking for more consideration for journalists in this matter is greater now than it has ever been before. Whereas thirty or forty years ago articles of great importance were usually published in quarterly, and subsequently in monthly, and more recently, perhaps, in weekly periodicals, now articles of real sustained merit appear in daily newspapers; and the change would surely argue that we ought to consider those articles which are now published in what have hitherto been considered ephemeral journals as carefully at least as our predecessors considered those which were published in reviews and on which a bargain could more easily be made. The noble Viscount in charge of the Bill will no doubt say that all this is governed by the contract which may be made between the proprietor and the author, and which would safeguard entirely the contributor. But, in point of fact, is that a good argument? Everybody knows, especially in these days when so many newspapers are controlled by one hand, what the budding contributor feels when he approaches the editor and endeavours to obtain work from him.</p>
<col>148</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00665">While formerly, or at all events thirty years ago, most of these articles were independently contributed by men unconnected with the paper, they are now written by men under contract of service, the majority of whom would, therefore, come under the operation of the clause if my Amendment is not accepted. As a rule the minority who would escape are those who do not require the protection given, and the majority included within the meshes of the clause are those who do. The better men, the men whom the editor desires to attach to his standard permanently, are the men who are hit by this clause, and are the men who perhaps would not see at the outset what they were doing in not asking for a contract. This is deeply felt by a large number of persons who are quite unable to protect themselves, and whose representatives were certainly under the impression that their case, having been represented to the Government, would have been dealt with by the Government in Grand Committee. Unfortunately the very strong views legitimately held by the proprietors have prevailed, and at present these gentlemen, in whose interests I am moving this Amendment, so numerous and so hardworking, are practically left without protection. I hope that the subsection which I now venture to move will be accepted by the noble Viscount.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00666">Amendment moved&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00667"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one possessing practical knowledge of the way in which this might work, perhaps I may be permitted to say a few words upon the Amendment. I speak to-day not in the capacity of a newspaper proprietor, or editor, or contributor to newspapers. I can look at the matter from the three points of view, and am in a position to speak impartially. I cannot say that I can support the Amendment. I think personally that the plan proposed by the Government is the better. May I recount to the House the usual procedure in these matters? Supposing that I contribute an article to <i>The Times;</i> they pay me for that article, and it is understood
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0079"/>
<col>149</col>
that I do not send the article to any other newspaper and do not publish it in a monthly magazine without their permission. That is an understood custom. Tint if the noble Viscount's Amendment were accepted it would be possible for me to write an article for <i>The Times</i> on Thursday, sell it again to the <i>Spectator</i> on Saturday, and republish it in the <i>Strand Magazine</i> the following week. That would upset the whole custom of the trade, and would obviously be to the disadvantage, not only of the editor and the proprietor, but of the journalist himself.<lb/>
Then take the case of a serial. The House knows that a great many distinguished novelists now write serial stories for newspapers and reserve the right to republish in book form. In that case the payment is nothing like so great as if the author had not reserved the right of republication in book form. Personally I do not think the noble Viscount's Amendment would add to the rights or the remuneration of journalists. On the other hand, it might work out to the disadvantage of the. smaller newspapers in the case of syndicated work. Some very distinguished journalist contributes an article which goes the round of several newspapers. It is well known that that article is published in various weekly newspapers all over the country, and he is paid at so much per article in each of those newspapers. That is all arranged. But if the Amendment of the noble Viscount is passed, he might extend it indefinitely and bring the whole thing to a state of chaos. I think that the Government's plan in the Bill is the better. From a practical point of view, these difficulties are always solved by means of contracts between the employer and the writer. I may remind the House that it is the present practice of newspapers to print on the back of the cheque by which the contributor is paid words to this effect, "A. B. hereby acknowledges payment for the publication of such and such an article the copyright of which is reserved," or, in the case of pictures, "the reproduction of which is reserved." That is the under stood custom of the trade, and after the matter has been discussed I hope the noble Viscount will see that there is a very strong case against his Amendment, and that it would, if accepted, disturb the whole custom of the trade which at present works very fairly and satisfactorily to all parties.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00668"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech to which we have just listened shows the enormous difficulties of this subject, and perhaps throws light on why the clause is framed as it stands in the Bill. I think we all agree with the noble Viscount that the contributor as the weaker party wants protection in this case, and therefore we ought to lay down as much protection for him. as we fairly can. But, on the other hand, you must not give him the right to take away other people's property. Let us take an instance which is analogous to one of those already put forward, of a war correspondent sent out at immense expense by a great journal to the theatre of war and who telegraphs back his article; day by day to that newspaper. Is it conceivable that he is the, next afternoon in the evening papers to have the right to republish those articles which cost the journal that seat him out thousands of pounds to obtain? That is only one out of thousands of examples I could instance.<lb/>
Take another case. There are articles published now in the great papers in what are called their supplements where special subjects are investigated at the expense of the newspaper. These supplements are sometimes commercial, sometimes they deal with technical industries, and sometimes with literary matters. The newspaper gets together at considerable expense a large body of material, and employs journalists of skill and experience to produce the articles for it on these special subjects. Is the journalist to have the right at once to republish those articles in a weekly paper, appearing, perhaps, the next day, notwithstanding that he has already been very highly paid for his services by the journal to which he belongs? These might be some of the outrageous eases which the Amendment would permit.<lb/>
Let us see if the author is protected by the Bill as it stands. In the clause as it is drawn there is a provision which entirely sweeps away that vagueness of the law which the noble Viscount instanced by quoting the words of Mr. Justice Maule. Under the old law, whether there was an agreement or not between the journalist and the newspaper for which he wrote under which the copyright was reserved to the journalist, it was a question of what was the agreement to be spelled out of the transaction between the parties. But the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0080"/>
<col>151</col>
Bill puts that on a safe footing; it provides that in the absence of an agreement to the contrary the journalist is the first owner of the copyright, and there is an exception made to that only in the case of a contract of service&#x2014;an exception which would certainly cover the case of the war correspondent to which I have referred. Now I ask your Lordships would it be just or fair, when articles have been written under a contract of service for a newspaper at great expense, that the journalist should have the right to reproduce those articles?<lb/>
The noble Viscount quoted the Talfourd Act of 1842, and said, truly enough, that by Section 18 there was a provision analogous to his Amendment. I know that section well, and I can assure the noble Viscount that nobody has ever been able to construe it. But one thing is clear, that the journalist had no right to republish the article. until twenty-eight years had elapsed. That is a very safe right to give to anybody. In the case of the war correspondent the war articles would not be of much value if published twenty-eight years alter. But the noble Viscount proposes that the war correspondent should be entitled to republish his articles immediately after they have appeared in the newspaper for which they have been written. My Lords, I am far from saying that these things are easy. They are not easy; we are all trying to protect people's rights, and particularly to protect those who most require protection; but we must. consider the publisher or the employer for whom the article is written as well as the author, and I submit to your Lordships that in eases such as I have put, and in many other cases also where vast outlay has been incurred by the newspaper in making possible the writing of the article, it would be very serious indeed to alter the law in another sense, and I therefore hope that the noble Viscount will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

will not quarrel with the formula so long as the noble Viscount can meet the substance of my noble friend's requirement. Let me, to begin with, take note of what. I thought was an important admission made a moment ago by the noble Viscount. He was at great pains to distinguish between the case of literary work and work of a different kind. We are now considering the case of the author and the publisher, who may be conveniently described as the contributor and the employer. No one questions the right of the employer to republish the articles contributed in the same form as they were originally published. There is no doubt as to that. But a question does arise when these same articles are at a future period published in a different form&#x2014;in the form of a book, or in some form different from that in which they were originally published&#x2014;and by either party. Unless I am mistaken-the noble Viscount will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;when this Bill first made its appearance it contained a clause, Clause 21 of the original draft, which, to some extent at any rate, dealt with the point raised by my noble friend, but as the Bill now stands, so far as I can understand it, the point is not dealt with. Two questions seem to me to arise. Does the contributor of these articles in the absence of a special agreement part absolutely and finally with his right?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00674"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: No: not unless he is under a contract of service. If he is not under a contract of service he keeps the copyright unless he has made an express agreement to part with it.</membercontribution></p>

If the noble Marquess will refer to the last line but one of subsection (<i>b</i>) he will see that the author, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, is to be the first owner of the copyright. That means unless you can prove an agreement that he has parted with the copyright to the person for whom he has written the article he retains the copyright. That is the advance we have made on the old state of the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00677"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Am I to understand that the clause as it now stands actually strengthens the position of the person who originally contributed the articles?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00678"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, immensely. Under the old law it used to be a spelling out by the Judges as to what was the intention, and sometimes the decisions turned one way and sometimes the other.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00680"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Assuming he is not under a contract of service it is quite clear that he retains the copyright and can publish the articles in book form.</membercontribution></p>

It is merely a question of drafting, but it seems to me t hat as the words stand they would not effect his object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00686"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I do not think we can quite leave the matter where the noble Viscount has left it. His contention, as I understand it, is that the position of the author is rather improved than otherwise by the Bill. My contention is exactly the reverse. I contend, first, that practice is opposed to the provision in subsection (<i>b</i>); secondly, that the old law gave the author the reversion which is now taken away from him; and, thirdly, that you lay the necessity of making a contract, on the weaker party instead of on the stronger. All that fell from my noble friend Lord Montagu is, of course, entirely cut away by the fact that the proprietor has it in his power at, any moment by a single word to bind the author not to republish without his consent; he has absolute power to make that contract at any time.</membercontribution></p>

he comes home; and if the Amendment of the noble Viscount is accepted the articles that that correspondent sends home could be published in the evening papers, and the daily journal which sent him out and paid all the expenses would get nothing further out of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00688"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Anybody may make a contract to bar the right of copyright, and my contention is that the stronger power is the one on whom the burden ought to be laid of making the contract. That, I think, the noble Viscount did not entirely dispute. I think my noble friend behind me and the noble Viscount have given the Amendment a much wider scope than it. was intended to have, or that it actually has, and if it is desired to meet me there is not the smallest difficulty in merely reserving the right of the author to republication in a book, or similar publication, rather than to run any of the risks of republication in other magazines at short date as anticipated by my noble friend Lord Montagu. I hardly like to assume, after the case that has been made out for it, that the noble Viscount does not propose to endeavour to meet this suggestion, and I should like to hear from him, before we decide whether we are going to divide on the Amendment or not, that some such limitation of the Amendment as is in our minds&#x2014;of republication entirely apart from ordinary journalistic work; that is to say, in a book, or some permanent record&#x2014;would have support from His Majestys Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00689"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I should very much like to see what the new clause would be before expressing any opinion. The Amendment as it stands would enable an author to break his contract in cold Wood, and that is a thing which I am sure would not be even contemplated and is not often proposed in this House. The author may have entered into a most solemn bargain to go out as war correspondent and produce exclusive articles for the journal which sent him out. Yet under the subsection of the noble Viscount it is contemplated that lie should be at liberty to republish those articles a very short time afterwards. There is great force in the criticism of the noble Earl opposite (Lord Camperdown) that the Amendment as drawn would not really have that effect, because it only proposes to reserve "any rights" I do
<col>156</col>
not know what that means, and obviously the noble Viscount would have to put the wording in a much more precise form before we could consider it. But I want to repeat this. The Bill in the clearest form vests the copyright in the author of the article in all ordinary cases, and he retains it unless he chooses to give it up by agreement. If he enters into a contract of service, or makes an agreement to part with the copyright, is it right that he should be allowed to break his contract? He has contracted not to republish his articles, and I really do not see why he should be freed from the ordinary consequences of his contract.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00690"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I cannot argue the matter further if the noble Viscount does not see his way to accept the Amendment. But I wish to put it on record that the decision of the Government really amounts to this, that if a man has been paid only three or four hundred a year on a contract of service and produces articles so valuable that they can be reproduced by his proprietor in a book which realises a profit of ten thousand pounds, he does not get a single sixpence for the use of his brains beyond the three or four hundred a year for which lie was originally employed. I do not think the noble Viscount can consider that that is an equitable result. After what has been said I will not press the Amendment at this moment, but I should like to consider before Report what has been said.</membercontribution></p>

The proposal in the Bill is this: the copyright having been extended to the life of the author and fifty years after, the author is to be disabled from assigning that copyright for the last twenty-five years of the term. He can assign the copyright for his life and the first twenty-five years after his death, but he cannot assign for the second twenty-five years after his death. That is so far inalienable. He may by his will dispose of this residue of his copyright, and in any case it becomes part of his personal estate at his death and becomes liable to administration and devolves on his legal representatives as part of his estate, but he is disabled from entering into any agreement dealing with the copyright for the second twenty-five years after his death. I do not know how the proposal originated, and I do not know that it is found in the system of laws of any other
<col>158</col>
country. We therefore approach this question free from any embarrassment as to the laws of other countries; it is an entirely novel proposition to secure apparently to authors by a new species of entail, for which there is no parallel elsewhere, an inalienable copyright in their works after a period of twenty-five years from their death. That is, indeed, putting authors in leading strings, and treating them as persons who cannot take care of their own interests and who must be protected in this very unusual fashion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00697">I do not know in whose interests this extraordinary proposal has been conceived, or how it will work, and I beg your Lordships to consider for a moment the effect it will have upon the printing and publishing of books. A man writes a book and gets a publisher to publish it for as long as he has power over it&#x2014;that is for his life and twenty-five years after. The twenty-live years subsequent he cannot deal with. It is like a man having a lease for 100 years which he wishes to dispose of, and being able to sell for the first fifty years and not the second fifty. What advantage does the assignee in the ease of a house, for example, get by the possession of the first half if he is not able to acquire the second half? He is not able to develop the property properly, because he has always got the approach of a term which will put an end to his interest. And so in this case if you assign the copyright of a book for twenty-five years after your death the publisher has got waiting upon him, not an extinction of the copyright, but a copyright in some other person over whom he has no power and with whom lie has entered into no business relations. The proposal seems to me to be quite injurious to the circulation of the book as a matter of literature, injurious to the trade, and injurious to the author; and yet this extraordinary legislation is said to be for the protection of those who are able, I suppose, to look after their own interests as well as any other of His Majesty's subjects. My noble and learned friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Gorell), I do not know that I am entitled to say sought to get out of it, but he made a proposition seeking to modify the proposal in respect of the publication of certain collected works, and I invite him to join with me in getting rid altogether of this proviso.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00699"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend is, I think, in rather a difficult case. He has been reproaching us up to a few moments ago for making the term of copyright too long, and now he is reproaching us for putting limitations upon it and strictures with regard to the shutting out of the public. He says the author is able to take care of himself, and asks why he should not be allowed to deal with the publisher himself. The proviso to Clause 3 of the Bill says that at any time after the expiration of twenty-five years from the death of the author anybody may republish the work on giving notice in writing of his intention to do so and on paving royalties at the rate of 10 per cent. Therefore an absolute copyright is only given for life and twenty-five years after death. After that, so far as publication is concerned, the only thing that remains is a right to receive royalties, and the only question my noble friend is discussing is whether that right to receive royalties should go to the publisher or to the author and with every respect to the publisher we think he has enough when he has an absolute right for life and twenty-five years after the author's death. It is the author's descendants we are trying to help. While we do not allow them to shut out the public for the last twenty-fire years of the fifty we secure to them that they shall have at least 10 per cent. royalties, and the meaning of this proviso which my noble friend wishes to strike out is simply that the author is not to be allowed to contract himself out of what we think a fair standard of rights, but that for the last twenty-five years, in the shape either of the copyright itself or of royalties from those who republish the book, the benefit is to be secured to his family. He may assign to his publisher for life and twenty-five years, and after that his right in the copyright returns to his descendants, and they can part with it again, or it can be dealt with in any other way as the subject of royalties. Tile framework of the Bill was the result of very careful discussion in another place. The effect of the extension of the copyright to life and fifty I years after death was fully considered, and this proviso was put in to safeguard
<col>160</col>
the interest of the public in that regard while allowing something for the author's family. We have, we think, taken a sensible and practical course in that respect, and I trust my nobile friend will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00702"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Amendment to add the words "or a work of joint authorship" at the end of subsection (2) is an attempt, it may be not a correct one but. I hope it will be considered so, to get rid of what seems to me to be a very formidable difficulty. The noble and learned Viscount has explained fully the operation of this proviso, but in the case of joint authorship, referred to in another section later on where the length of copyright in cases of joint authors' works is dealt with, I confess that it seems to me a very great difficulty will arise in the operation of this proviso unless the words which I propose are added at the end of it. I fail to see how this proviso works out in the case of a joint authorship, because its scheme is to deal with the ownership in one person of a work. The first owner of a copyright cannot assign for the last twenty-five years of the period of fifty years after his death. On the termination of that period the copyright is to devolve on his legal personal representative. I do not think, with deference, that this clause copes with the difficulties which will arise in the case of a work of joint authorship, and it seems to me that the only way to get rid of the complication is to add to the end of this proviso the words which I propose. You will then eliminate from the proviso the case where the work was a work of joint authorship, and get rid of this difficulty which seems to me to be almost insuperable in the clause as it stands.</membercontribution></p>

the provisions with regard to joint authorship will be found. My noble friend says truly that the application of the proviso as it stands will create considerable complication in the case of joint authorship, but it affords an illustration of how you have to choose between disadvantages. If my noble friend's Amendment is accepted, the proviso would become nugatory, because all you would have to do would be to put in a nominal joint author, and then you are removed from the operation of the proviso. We have considered this very carefully, and on the whole, as at present advised, I would ask my noble and learned friend not to press the Amendment. I think the balance of disadvantages is heavily against it. But I will consider the matter further between now and Report, and see if we can devise any means of meeting the difficulty.</membercontribution></p>

The suggestion is put forward that

it would strengthen the clause if a defendant had to prove that he had no reasonable ground for suspecting the existence of copyright.

The noble Lord said: Authors are much concerned about this Clause 8. They fear that the publishers may avoid all responsibility for the deliberate wrongdoings of their piratical authors. The Society of Authors, for instance, say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is of the very utmost importance that the persons in such a case who print a work or cause it to be printed should be answerable to the same extent as the author who compiles it. If the publisher or infringer can take up the attitude, 'I am innocent, and had no knowledge of the source from which the book was derived; your remedy, if any, must be against the author,' then in nine cases out of ten it would be impossible to get any satisfaction in respect of the damage caused by the infringer."</quote></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00735"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid that this suggested new clause would be very difficult to work, either as it is drafted or with any amendment which carried out its principle. The difficulty is this. It proceeds on the hypothesis that the real defendant is the person who has made the infringing copies. But he is generally not so. The real defendant is generally the unfortunate publisher who publishes a book brought to him by somebody who has pirated it. The publisher cannot tell that it has been pirated; he cannot compare it with all copyrighted works. He has to take it on trust from the author, and the only defence he could successfully set up if this proposed clause was to pass would be if the author had reasonable grounds for believing that the infringed work was in the public domain. He would have to prove the innocence of the infringer, and it might be that the infringer was a person who could not easily he brought forward to give evidence. In that event the case of the publisher would be a very hard one. I think a much more real protection for the publisher is the clause giving a complete discretion over costs and damages in the case of an innocent infringer. It is better, particularly after the strengthening words which have just been added by my noble and learned friend Lord Cored, to leave the law as the Bill proposes to constitute it, than to enter upon this somewhat complicated instrument of defence.</membercontribution></p>

This Bill has passed through the House of Commons without dissent, and the only Amendments that were put in were drafting Amendments inserted in Standing Committee by the wish of the Irish Office. In 1907 a Bill was passed to enable women to sit on county and borough councils in England and Scotland, and we in Ireland now only ask for the same privileges to be extended to our womenkind. There is a proviso that if a woman is elected chairman of a county council or mayor of a borough she cannot sit as a justice of the peace. The same law
<col>168</col>
exists in England and Scotland. I hope the Bill will pass exactly as it stands and that no Amendments may be offered, otherwise there is not the smallest chance, as your Lordships can well imagine, of the Bill becoming law this session.

As the noble Earl has said, there is in the Bill a provision that the rule that a man who is mayor of a borough or chairman of a county council should be <i>ex officio</i> a justice of the peace should not apply in the case of women. I may mention that the Bill does not touch the question of franchise at all. It merely enables a woman to be elected a member of a county or borough council, and the Irish Office see no objection whatever to its passage.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00774">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Amendment which stands in my name, although it is a somewhat lengthy one, docs not need much explanation.

<col>169</col>
fact, practically the whole of the Act of 1862 is repealed by the schedule attached to this Bill. Artists feel sorely aggrieved on this point. They say that it is a matter of very great disturbance to them in their profession that anybody should be allowed to produce a copy of their work, very inferior in quality, and put the artist's initials to it as if it were a <i>bona fide</i> production. I do not think anybody who has the smallest conception of what the artistic nature is can deny that that would be to artists not only a hardship, but an extremely galling hardship.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00775">The noble Viscount, in the, if I may say so, charming speech in which he moved the Second Reading of this Bill, told us that it was a Bill which must take from somebody in order to give to somebody else. That may be so. I think most Bills take from somebody in order to give to somebody else. But this Bill is unique in one point, and that is that as it stands it will tend to take an honest man's work in order to give it to a rogue and forger. That is a position which the artists on behalf of whom I speak feel to be a very great grievance, and they are anxious that the Government should reintroduce the clauses of the Act of 1862 which protected them in this respect. Therefore in the Amendment which 1 am moving those clauses are introduced, and I hope that the noble Viscount may see his way to do in this respect an act of justice which I venture to think is very much called for.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00786"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble and learned Viscount deals with this matter, might I say a few words upon it? I do not think at present it is quite appreciated what this Amendment proposes to do. In the Fine Arts Copyright Act of 1862 there are provisions which are substantially the same as are found in this Amendment, but they are confined to paintings, drawings, and photographs, and, as i understand, this Amendment proposes to extend those sections to works of sculpture. The provisions of the Copyright Act of 1862 which deal with this are still preserved in the latter part of the Bill. Your Lordships will find that while the schedule repeals Sections 1 to 6, certain words in Section 8, and Sections 9 to 12, it leaves standing the penal provisions which deal with photographs, paintings and drawings. Those sections are untouched. There may be a difference as to the length of time at which they could be put in force by reason of the extension of time in this Bill during which copyright runs. But I understand that in drafting this Bill it was not considered that those sections had really any strict relationship to the law of copyright. They were to prevent frauds and punish fraudulent actions of the kinds indicated in the section&#x2014;namely, fraudulently signing a painting, drawing, or photograph; fraudulently selling or distributing any work having the name, initial, or monogram, of the person who did not execute it; fraudulently issuing any colourable imitation; gelling an altered work as though it were an unaltered work, and so on. Your Lordships will sec that those are cases dealt with by that Act in order to prevent fraud. They are not, strictly speaking, copyright matters, with which this Bill purports to deal. It was therefore considered, as I understand, that those two sections of the Act of 1862 were not properly part of the law of copyright, but that as they conferred a right in connection with such frauds it was not desirable that they should be repealed. Accordingly they are, in the schedule to which I have referred, left unrepealed, but it was not thought right in a Copyright Bill to extend those sections. If this matter is considered very carefully it will be seen that, strictly speaking, these provisions as they stand, and the extended ones, have no strict relationship to the law of copyright. They are to prevent people committing frauds by passing off goods as those of an author when they are not his at all, or where they have been altered or
<col>172</col>
dealt with in some such way. The proposal in this Amendment, which is substantially to extend these provisions to works of sculpture, might equally well be extended to all sorts of things in which there is copyright. Therefore I venture to suggest that this Amendment ought not to be accepted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00787"><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I understand what the noble and learned Lord says as to this proposed clause not being really part of a Copyright Bill. But may I ask this question? Do we understand that the protection given in the Act of 1862 is not repealed as regards this particular provision, and that the law, therefore, remains as it is at present?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00788"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: That is so. The question whether Section 7 of the Fine Arts Copyright Act of 1862 should be repealed was considered when this Bill was framed, and the view taken, after a good deal of balancing of opinion, was this. Certain classes of persons with fine art copyrights (which did not include sculpture) have got this statutory offence created for their protection already, and it was thought better not to take away what they have got. But the Government were very averse to the creation of a new statutory offence. It is always undesirable to create new statutory offences. The Common Law gives a remedy for this kind of fraud. At the time when the Act of 1862 was drafted it was thought Tight to make a new statutory offence. The view finally taken was this&#x2014;Do not take away what they have got, but do not extend it. Consequently it was not thought right to create the offence by Statute for sculpture also. Those are the reasons which weighed with those who framed the Bill in the fashion in which it now stands. There was this further consideration, that these provisions in Section 7 of the Fine Arts Copyright Act of 1862 have nothing whatever to do with copyright, and we are very unwilling to load the Bill with something which is really not germane to its scope.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00789"><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand the argument which the noble and learned Viscount uses, but I do think sculpture is rather hardly treated. Sculptors suffer under a very great grievance, quite as great a grievance as painters suffer through the fraudulent attachment of their signatures. Do I understand the noble

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00790"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes. It would be an amendment to a Criminal Code. I do not express any opinion as to whether it would be desirable to extend this class of offence. The noble Earl referred to sculpture. Well, why not a book? Why should not this be extended to fraudulently putting the name of the wrong author on a book and selling it? If you extend it at all, you ought to extend it to every form of copyright article. The reason we have not put in sculpture is that, we rather demurred to the principle of Section 7. Were that being dealt with <i>de novo</i>, we should act differently. But as I have said, we have not thought it right to take away from these particular forms of art protection which they at present possess, and if we extended it to sculpture we should feel bound to extend it to books and other things.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00802"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have put down two classes of Amendments in connection with this clause. I should like to take them quite separately in what I have to say, though it looks as if they all related to the same matter What I propose to do is to try to make plain that I am dealing first with a set of Amendments which are only concerned with the question of what ought to be done with regard to the books which are supplied to the libraries mentioned in the clause. The other Amendments deal only with a minor matter of drafting, in order to make clear the position with regard to books which are published over a period in parts, and as to which I think the clause as it at present stands is not sufficiently clear with regard to the time of demand. I move to insert, at the beginning of subsection (2), the words "Subject to the provisions of this section"; in the ninth line of the same subsection, to leave out the words "subject to the provisions of this section"; in lines 21 and 22 to leave out "to the National Library of Wales" and insert "for the authorities of any library mentioned in this section other than the trustees of the British Museum"; and in line 23, after "may," to insert "as respects that library." Those four Amendments really all relate to the same matter, and perhaps I may be permitted to deal with them substantially in moving what looks like a merely formal Amendment to insert the words "Subject to the provisions of this section."<lb/>
The point that I wish to put before your Lordships is shortly this. If the clause with which I am at the present moment con-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0092"/>
<col>175</col>
cerned is referred to, you will find that it provides for the publisher of every book published in the United Kingdom delivering within one month of publication, at his own expense, a copy of the book to the trustees of the British Museum. I should like to point out that this refers to every book published, whether or not the book is subject to copyright. In addition to supplying that copy to the British Museum, the publisher has also, if written demand is made within a limited time, to deliver a copy of each book to the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the University Library at Cambridge, the Library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh, and the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, and, subject to the provisions of Clause 15, to the National Library of Wales. Subsection (3) of this clause provides that the copy delivered to the trustees of the British Museum shall be a copy of the whole book, with all maps and illustrations belonging thereto finished and coloured in the same manner as the best copies of the book are published, and shall be bound and on the best paper on which the book is printed. The copy of the book delivered to the other authorities I have mentioned is to be on the paper on which the largest number of the copies of the book is printed for sale, and must be in the like condition as the books prepared for sale. Then a special provision is made with regard to the National Library of Wales, which is an addition to the present number of libraries to which copies have to be delivered. The books of which copies are to be delivered to the National Library of Wales are not to include books of such classes as may be specified in regulations to be made by the Board of Trade.<lb/>
I have now stated, I hope sufficiently clearly, what the clause is intended to do. The question of what the Amendment is intended to do is the next matter. The Amendment is intended not to go so far as was recommended in the Report of the Royal Commissioners of 1878, who recommended the repeal of these provisions except so far as they related to the British Museum; but the Amendment suggests that there should be some control or some check upon the right to demand every book that is published. In the Report of the Royal Commissioners of 1878 a short history of the Statutes and so forth which bring about the present situation is given, and it is also shortly stated in the Memorandum which has been prepared by the publishers.
<col>176</col>
I do not know whether your Lordships have seen it, but a copy has been sent to me. The publishers say that the exaction is the remnant of an enactment connected with the literary censorship, established after the Restoration, and intended to prevent the publication of heretical, blasphemous, immoral, or seditious books. The first trace of any special provision as regards the great public libraries is to be found as far back as the early part of the seventeenth century, when Sir Thomas Bodley founded the Bodleian Library, and obtained, in 1610, not a statutory provision, but a grant from the Stationers' Company of a copy of every work published in the country. Apparently an arrangement was made with the Stationers' Company, who at that time would probably be in control of publishing, to give to the library a copy of every book published in the country. The position with regard to the public libraries referred to was developed, as time went on, in the earlier Copyright Acts. The first of those that I have been able to trace is a Statute in Queen Anne's reign which contained provisions that there should be nine copies delivered by the publishers: one to the Royal Library, one to the Oxford Library&#x2014;that is, the Bodleian Library, I take it&#x2014;one to the University of Cambridge, four to the Scottish Universities, one to Sion College, and one to the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh. As far as I can trace it, that seems to be the first Statute of copyright where this matter is clearly and definitely laid down in the terms which I have just stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00803"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: There was a Statute in 1662.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00804"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: The Royal Commissioners of 1878 reported that the obligation dated from the time of Charles II, but I have not gone back so far. I thought it sufficient to stop at Queen Anne. From then the privilege has varied from time to time, both as regards the number of copies required to be presented and the libraries entitled to them. At one time I think it was only three; but the maximum number of copies at any one time was as high as eleven to different libraries. The position was regulated in 1842 by the Copyright Act, which applies not only to the United Kingdom but to every part of the British dominions, and that required a copy of every book published, together with subsequent editions with alterations and additions, to be delivered as follows: one each to the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0093"/>
<col>177</col>
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh and Trinity College, Dublin&#x2014;the same as in this Bill, with the exception of Wales&#x2014;with a best copy to the British Museum. I find that in 1836, before that Act was passed, the other authorities were eliminated, leaving only those that are in the Act of 1842, and some compensation by way of grant was made to them by the Treasury.<lb/>
It will be seen, if the Act of 1842 is referred to, that it applied, as this one does, to every book published and to all subsequent editions if there were any alterations or additions contained in them, and that the British Museum took a copy as a matter of course. The others&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;took, as they will take under this Bill, their copies if demanded, and they would take books of the kind of which the largest number of copies were printed. The Commissioners state in their Report that, as a matter of fact, copies of nearly every work of importance were presented to all the five libraries which then had the privilege, and they said that many witnesses were called before them who complained of the obligation as being a heavy and an unjust tax. They said it was not felt hardly in the case of low-priced books or in the case of books which were in very large circulation, which I take it would include books which had not a great cost, but that it was felt hardly in the cases of books of expensive character; and they also added that large numbers were sent without any demand, though I am not quite sure that that is consistent with what they had previously said. The Commissioners reported that on the whole they considered that the complaint, of the authors and publishers was well founded, and recommended that so much of the law as to gratuitous presentation to libraries as required copies to be given to libraries other than the British Museum should be repealed. The bodies to whom these libraries belong are, they thought, possessed of considerable means and well able to purchase the books required by them, and they pointed out that they would only be deprived of a right to obtain property to be thereafter created.<lb/>
In the Memorandum which they have issued the publishers refer to the well-known article which appeared in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> in 1819, in which a list of books is cited the publication of which,
<col>178</col>
they say, the enactment either prevented or severely handicapped. They say, further, that in course of time it has become the practice of the four libraries other than the British Museum to apply for a copy of every book published, including a vast mass of printed matter which cannot possibly be of any use to their. The fact that the Act which at present exists and also this Bill require that the Universities and other libraries should demand what they want tends to show that what they are expected to demand are books which are really necessary or desirable for the libraries. The publishers contend that for them to demand every book of every kind published in the country is going beyond what is contemplated, and that unless some control i is imposed there is no means actually of stopping anything that may be demanded. This Bill applies to all books published, as did the old Act of 1842, and that is all books whether copyright exists in them or not.<lb/>
The position in this country is certainly more severe upon publishers and authors than it is in any other country. A table is given in the Memorandum which has been circulated by the publishers showing that in four countries, Italy being one, three free copies are provided. In France and a number of other countries two free copies ar provided. In Germany, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Norway and other countries no free copies are provided; so that England at present stands in a position in which more is asked of those who produce books than in any other country, so far as my information goes, in the world. It is obvious that it must add, whatever the amount may be, considerable cost to the publishers, and indirectly through them to the authors, in placing upon them the duty of providing free copies to a certain number of libraries. In the case of very expensive books the charge placed upon the publishers may be a serious matter. One knows from general information that books are nowadays published in which the author's part is very little, and which contain plates, engravings, and so forth which have involved enormous cost&#x2014;books the price of which may be 40 or 50 guineas; and if free copies of those books have to be delivered it would amount to a great additional cost. I dm not suggesting that this right which has existed for so long should be wholly repealed, as was recommended by the Commissioners in 1878. I
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0094"/>
<col>179</col>
understand that the publishers themselves state that what they require is a provision that none but such books as can be of value in academic libraries should be supplied. Therefore the suggestion is made that there should be some regulation of the books which ought to be supplied.<lb/>
Then the question arises how should this be regulated. At present the suggestion with regard to Wales is that there should be regulations made by the Board of Trade. The words in the clause are&#x2014;
<quote>"The books of which copies are to be delivered to the National Library of Wales shall not include books of such classes as may be specified in regulations to be made by the Board of Trade."</quote>
It may be said that the Board of Trade has not much to do necessarily with the literary world. At the same time if any control at all is to be placed upon the demand, somebody will have to be constituted for the purpose of making regulations on the matter; and if regulations are made by such an authority as that indicated they should not become operative until they had lain on the Table of both Houses for a certain time in order that objections could be made to them if necessary. Broadly speaking, the point comes to this. This is an old privilege; there is a hardship felt by those who have to submit to it, and an expense is put upon them by it. Is it not reasonable that some control should be exercised, so that books which are not really necessary for the purpose of any particular library or institution should to a certain extent be regulated, and regulated in such a manner that the regulations should be placed before the Houses of Parliament before becoming operative? The Amendments which I have put down would enable different regulations to be made for different libraries, and I now leave the matter to your Lordships. I move in the terms of my first Amendment, on which the others will substantially depend.</membercontribution></p>

I need hardly say that those who, like myself, share the noble and learned Lord's view are not animated by the smallest feeling of ill-will against the Universities.
<col>180</col>
I feel quite certain, more especially as we have the advantage of the presence in this House of the distinguished Chancellor of the University of Oxford, that we shall hear the case more especially for the Bodleian Library put before us by him with great force. I quite recognise that the Bodleian Library, owing to its antiquity and high reputation, deserves special consideration, but we have not only to deal with the Bodleian Library but with four other libraries, or, including Wales, five. But really what has raised the whole of this question is the fear of the publishers that the arguments which are made to apply in the case of Wales would apply equally in the case of other Universities, such as Leeds and Sheffield, and they do not exactly see where concessions will end. If the question of Wales had not been raised at all, although publishers and authors have long since complained of the present position of the law, they would have been prepared to bear it.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Cross Benches has pointed out that in this matter we are already far more liberal than other nations. I need not, therefore, repeat what he has said on that point. The complaint is not as regards ordinary works, but as regards certain works of which there is a limited production and which cost large sums of money. I have in my hand a list of books of this nature. Here, for instance, is a work published a short time ago by Messrs. Constable &amp; Co., "The Bridgwater Gallery," containing 120 of the most noted paintings at Bridgwater House reproduced in photogravure, and the cost price of which was fifty guineas. It would be an exaggeration to say that by giving these five copies the publishers lose five times fifty guineas because they might not have been able to sell them at all, but it is a fact they they are making a present of goods which they value at two hundred and fifty guineas, and I think it is asking a good deal of them. There are numerous other cases of works published at smaller sums. There is "The Lives and Works of James and William Ward," by Mrs. Frankau, published at thirty guineas; "John Raphael Smith: His Life and Works," published at thirty guineas; and quite recently "The Story of Emma, Lady Hamilton," published at thirty guineas. The last-named work consists of a story of Lady Hamilton's youth, and contains reproductions in photogravure of a number of those celebrated pictures of Romney representing this remarkable lady as Circe, Euphrosyne, The Nun,

<col>181</col>
St. Cecilia, The Spinster, and several times as a Bacchante. I can hardly conceive a work of a less academic character or one less necessary for the tuition, instruction, and edification either of the authorities at the Universities or of those students who Hock for instruction and study to the Bodleian Library. It may, perhaps, be argued that these works are not; presented merely for academical purposes, but if that is not the reason why they are asked for by the Universities, what is the reason? It is perfectly clear that the Legislature contemplated some control. That is to say, it contemplated that not all the works that are produced should be presented to the libraries.<lb/>
My noble and learned friend on the Cross Benches alluded to an article which was published in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> in 1819 written by the poet Southey. I should like to read a passage. Mr. Southey in this article is quoting from a work by Sir Egerton Brydges, who was at that time a Member of Parliament, and, I believe, an author, though I have never read any of his works. Sir Egerton Brydges said&#x2014;
<quote>"They [the publishers and authors] wore told that the public bodies would exercise their claims mildly and liberally; that they would take lists, and only call for such books as they absolutely wanted; that their main object was to establish their right, but trust them, and it should be seen how they would use the power. See, indeed, how they use it&#x0021;"</quote>
I do think that the University authorities have rather strained the powers which the law has given them by asking for every book, and it is that of which the publishers complain. If they had asked for books which were really required for instructional purposes, no complaint would have been made, but to ask for every book published, whether expensive or inexpensive, is surely going outside the spirit of the law, and some control should be exercised over them.<lb/>
It may, perhaps, be said that it is objectionable to give any Government Department control in these matters, and that that objection applies more especially to the Board of Trade, which has to deal with commercial and not with educational matters. I sympathise with that objection and would be the last to encourage the tendency to increase the powers of Government Departments, but I do not here see how it can be avoided. One way of avoiding it, of course, would be to incorporate the regulations in the Bill, but there are valid
<col>182</col>
objections to that course, as I understand the regulations would require to be changed from time to time, and if they were incorporated in the Act they could only be changed by an Act of Parliament. Another way in which the evil, if it be an evil, could be mitigated is by providing that the regulations when passed should lie on the Table of both Houses of Parliament to enable those who had objections to state their case. Personally I may say, although I shall support the noble and learned Lord if he goes to a Division, I do not attach enormous importance to the precise method which the noble and learned Lord has suggested. If His Majesty's Government are prepared to consider the matter and produce something which will set up control in a different way, I think the noble and learned Lord would be very wise to accept it. I trust that when the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill speaks he will tell us that he will be able to do something in that direction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00807"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Gorell, made, if I may say so, a very moderate and reasoned statement of his case, and it has been supported by the great authority of the noble Earl who has just addressed the House. But I hope that your Lordships will not be persuaded by those arguments but will be prepared to believe that there is another and very different side of the case which is capable of being sustained by reasons not only equal but better. The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, told us how the matter had arisen, and it is very important that your Lordships should bear this in mind. It is proposed, I believe, to constitute a National Library in Wales. The creation of that, institution is a very proper compliment to Welsh sentiment, and I do not think there is any one in this House who would object to the idea for a moment. Such a library, I imagine, when constituted will exist for the most part for the collection of works relating to Welsh history, Welsh literature, and so on. In other words, it will be a library of a necessarily somewhat restricted character. But merely because it is intended to constitute this library with this restricted scope and therefore to apply to it provisions for creating some means by which there shall be a discrimination in the character of the books supplied, it is now proposed at the last moment in your Lordships' House, in the shape of an Amendment to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0096"/>
<col>183</col>
this Bill, to make changes which form no part of the Bill itself, which were not mentioned in the House of Commons, which so far as I know were never heard of by us until the noble and learned Lord put his Amendment down on the Paper, and which are intended to deprive certain great libraries of this country of privileges which they have long enjoyed.<lb/>
These libraries are five in number&#x2014;the two University Libraries of Oxford and Cambridge, the Library at Edinburgh, the Library at Trinity College, Dublin, and the British Museum. We all concede that the British Museum stands in a category apart. No one proposes to modify its privileges. The case arises as regards the remaining four. I am bound to confess that I have no right to speak on behalf of the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh or of the Trinity College Library in Dublin. I know nothing except by repute of those institutions. Neither have I, of course, any right to speak except as a representative of one University for the Library of the other University. But I do speak for the Bodleian Library at Oxford. I am not anxious&#x2014;I do not know that it would be fair&#x2014;to discriminate between the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the University Library at Cambridge, although for my own part, being more familiar with the conditions of the Bodleian, I think I can make out a case for that library which does place it in a somewhat exceptional position.<lb/>
The rights of which you are asked by the Amendment to deprive the Bodleian Library are rights which it has enjoyed for over 300 years. They were first obtained by its founder Sir Thomas Bodley, who when he created the library in the beginning of the seventeenth century made an arrangement with the Stationers' Company&#x2014;which at that time had a monopoly in the publication of books&#x2014;under which they gave him a copy of every book that they published. That right it enjoyed for a number of years, until in 1662 it was confirmed by Statute; and the privilege was again endorsed in the first Copyright Act of 1710. In 1836 the curators of the Bodleian Library were offered &#x00A3;500 by the Government to surrender this privilege, but so much value did they attach to it that they declined the offer and the right has been in existence ever since.<lb/>
Now what is there to justify this right? May I be allowed to dispute altogether the conception of the Bodleian Library which
<col>184</col>
was put before us by the noble Earl, Lord Cromer? He spoke of it more than once as if it were a purely academic institution existing solely for the instruction of Dons and undergraduates. He even took the case of the history of Lady Hamilton and asked what was the good of giving a book of that sort to the Bodleian Library. It could, he said, hardly appeal to the Dons &#x2014;about which I am not at all certain&#x2014;and it ought not to appeal to the undergraduates, about which I am even less sure. Again, when he was speaking about the instructions that might have to be issued in the future he argued, What could be easier than to lay down whether a book is or is not of instructional value? But these are not the tests. The Bodleian is more than an academic institution. It is an institution, it is true, which exists to a large extent for the encouragement of study and learning amongst the residents of Oxford. But it is much more, than that. If you go into the Bodleian Library at any time you will find its galleries filled not merely with students of the University, but with scholars from all parts of the world, who go there to study books under conditions of tranquillity such as exist nowhere else. Not only that, but we make a return for this. I happen to know myself, from my connection with Oxford, that we lend manuscripts, books, and so on all over the world. Moreover, when the books are sent to our officials we bind them, store them, catalogue them, and in every way place them at the disposal of students. Thus we stand, not in the position of an academic library at Oxford, but in the place of a great national institution, one of the principal repositories of literature in this country.<lb/>
I think I might make another point. Is it wise, even admitting the special character of the British Museum, that you should treat that as the only great national repository of published books in this country? Supposing some great conflagration were to occur or the British Museum were to be wrecked and its contents destroyed, what a lamentable thing it would be if there were no other institution to which to turn for that which you had unfortunately lost. I submit that this is a consideration worth thinking of, and that it might, indeed, be wise, whatever you do with regard to the other libraries, that you should maintain at least one University library on the same footing as the British Museum.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0097"/>
<col>185</col>
The noble and learned Lord said it was rather hard on the publishers to have to give to a number of institutions copies of books of an expensive character. The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, was quite fair in saying that the burden to the publishers is, of course, not to be measured by the actual pecuniary value of the book. I am not concerned to dispute that the gift of these books does involve some sacrifice to the publishers. The question is whether it is a burden that they can legitimately be asked to bear. I think it is, for these reasons. In the first place, publishers as a body gain enormously by the privileges conceded to them in. the Copyright Act, and the noble Viscount opposite pointed out on the Second Reading that those privileges are really enhanced under this Bill. Publishers on the whole, and authors with them, are placed in a better position. It is, perhaps, therefore not unreasonable to ask that they should make some return to the public for the privileges that they enjoy. I would put another consideration to your Lordships that occurs to me. The noble Earl seemed to think that when a thirty-guinea book or a sixty-guinea book goes into the Bodleian Library it disappears from sight I here, and is, so to speak, buried in this vast tomb of unread literature. I do not think that is by any means the case; and if I were a publisher I would rather be disposed to welcome the gratuitous form of advertisement for important books which I thus obtained. What I mean is this. Publishers publish books, but in order to be successful in their trade they want, in the first place, authors to write books, and, in the second place, purchasers to buy them. I should imagine that the spectacle of a book, particularly of a book like the "Life of Lady Hamilton," lying on the table of the Bodleian Library might act as a distinct advertisement of the book and tempt persons who saw that book to buy it. It might induce others to write similar or better works. I may tell your Lordships that I am speaking from what has happened in my own case. One of my practices, being a busy man, is to go to a library and see the books which are lying on the table, and if I am attracted by one of them I buy it. I think, therefore, there is a form of return to the publishers for the slight burden&#x2014;for I do not think it is anything more than a slight burden&#x2014;which they are asked to bear.<lb/>
Then there was a further point dealt with
<col>186</col>
by both noble Lords about possible restrictions on the use of this right in the future. It is proposed in the Bill that the restrictions upon the National Library of Wales should be framed by the Board of Trade, and the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, seemed to contemplate, although with some hesitation, that the same authority might be applied to the University libraries. Lord Gorell, I think, was rather more doubtful about the point. He suggested that it might be desirable to constitute some other body which he did not name. Just think for a moment what that body would have to be. I take it the Board of Trade means a collection of different officials and clerks mostly interested in non-literary questions. Imagine a Board of Trade clerk sitting down to draw up a sort of <i>index expurgalorius</i>&#x2014;a list of what books ought to be admitted to the Bodleian Library and what books ought not. Imagine him going in with his list to the President of the Board of Trade, who is a very busy man and frequently quite destitute of literary instincts. That official promptly puts his signature at the end of the list in order to get rid of it at once and the matter is settled. I ask your Lordships to imagine the supply of books to a great library being made dependent on a procedure of that kind.<lb/>
Again it is said, Why not lay the regulations on the Table of the House? Do we not know that countless Papers are laid on the Table of the House and are noticed by no one, simply because our attention is not called to them? Does this suggestion mean that the regulations are to lie on the Table in this House, or on the Table in the House of Commons, and that the Members for the University of Oxford in the other House or the unfortunate Chancellor of the University here are always to be ferreting about on the Table in order to discover what books it is proposed that the Bodleian Library shall have and what it shall not have? I venture to think the plan would be found impossible.<lb/>
There is one other point to which I must refer. A noble Lord&#x2014;I think it was Lord Gorell&#x2014;said, "If you cease to give these libraries these books they will buy them of their own accord." Will they? Have they the means? Has the noble Lord satisfied himself as to the funds of these great institutions? I happen to know very well what
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0098"/>
<col>187</col>
the funds of the Bodleian Library are, and I know that if these books, perhaps more particularly the expensive books, are not given <i>gratis</i> they will not be bought at all. Let me give you the figures for last year of the acquisition of books by the Bodleian Library, because they are really more eloquent than anything I can say. Under the terms of the Copyright Act the Bodleian Library acquired last year 54,000 items. It purchased from its own funds&#x2014;money that comes in no case from the State, but from the University, the Colleges, and elsewhere&#x2014;263 new and second-hand books in the United Kingdom and 7,700 books from abroad. The latter is really a most important consideration, because it shows that such money as the Bodleian Library, for instance, allocates to the purchase of books it wisely devotes to accumulating foreign literature. Provided as it is with our own books, it goes abroad to secure others. Is it not quite clear that if you diminish its existing privilege that form of expenditure will cease, and that the library will only buy a small number of our English books, and will have to knock off its supply of foreign books altogether? I hope I have made out some case for saying that the University libraries in general, and the Bodleian Library in particular, deserve some consideration from the Government. I can only, in conclusion, ask your Lordships not to inflict in this sudden and unpremeditated way a great hardship and injustice on one of the principal national institutions of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00808"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, speaks, I would like to offer a few remarks on this most interesting subject. I would like to know first, how the present system works, and whether it is proposed that a new system should be established under the Bill in after years? Do all these institutions get every book that is published as a matter of course without any question of constant examination or criticism? Mast there be a demand made, general or special, or is each of these libraries given at once every book that is published? I would be glad to know exactly what the present practice is in reference to that. Again, is it intended under subsection (2) of this clause to make any, and, if any, what change? I rather gather from the general common-sense construction that would be put on this clause&#x2014;a clause on which the noble and learned Viscount on the Government Bench is
<col>188</col>
specially competent to speak&#x2014;that it is contemplated that each of these very learned bodies would make a request for books, and that request would be met by compliance. What I would like to know is whether it is intended that the request would be general, that is for all books that are published; whether it would be for books of a special character; or whether a requisition would be made for each particular book as it came out. I ask that for information, because it is obvious that the form in which these learned bodies asked to be supplied with books would make an immense difference in administration according to the plan adopted.<lb/>
I think the Universities may very well rest content with the admirable statement made by my noble friend who has just spoken. He has put their case before your Lordships with great clearness and skill. I can quite appreciate the point of view of the publishers in regard to this matter. I think that they deserve a good deal of sympathy in being asked as a matter of course to give, it may be, expensive books, for which there is a very small market, to the favoured institutions mentioned in this clause. I myself, having special sympathy with one of these favoured institutions, have not a word to say against this. I was Member for the University of Dublin in the House of Commons, I was educated at that University, and it follows that I have the highest sympathy for that great institution. In addition to the arguments used by my noble friend, Lord Curzon, I would point out in reference to Dublin University Library that it is an institution situated in the capital of Ireland, in a great city, and that its permits to read are readily extended to, and liberally used, by all those who are desirous to get the benefits of research in that institution. I trust the matter will be considered from a reasonable and historical point of view, which is not at all inconsistent with keeping in mind the great opportunity which these libraries afford for study, and for calm and useful research. I am not prepared to say that if some method of discrimination could be indicated which would prevent a great deluge of books flowing into these institutions, hundreds and thousands of which they cannot particularly need, I would not be ready to consider it in a fair and reasonable spirit, provided that the wishes and feelings of the Universities in reference to the selection were clearly and strongly borne in mind.</membercontribution></p>

<col>189</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00809"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Viscount speaks I would ask permission to intrude for a few moments if only to repeat in some measure what I said on the Second Reading of this Bill, because it appears to me that the argument I then used has not been referred to in the course of this debate, and, perhaps, has not been quite appreciated. On the general question I should be quite content to rest the case on the speech made by the noble Earl opposite who has spoken for the Bodleian Library and has used the strongest possible argument in support of the maintenance of the existing privileges. I claim for my own University of Cambridge the benefit of all the arguments which the noble Earl has used, and especially the last one, by which I lay great store, that the pecuniary resources of the University libraries, which are comparatively small, are practically exhausted in obtaining a supply of foreign books absolutely necessary for the use of the students of the University, and that no margin is left for the purchase of English books if that should become necessary.<lb/>
The point I wish to impress on your Lordships is that in the case of this privilege, such as it is&#x2014;and the argument against it which has been most relied upon by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches is one that will not stand examination, although that argument was implicitly in some measure adopted by the noble Earl on the Bench opposite&#x2014;the tax is not a tax upon publishers, but is really a tax upon the purchasers of the books. As many of your Lordships are aware, publishers as a class are very capable and keen-sighted people. Everybody who has had to do with them knows that their business is highly developed. It has received from generations of publishers the closest possible attention, and it is now worked in a very complete and exact form. If your Lordships would reflect upon the way in which a book, such as was referred to by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, is produced you would see at once that this question is not to be treated as one between the publishers and the Universities, but that it is a tax on the reading public as a whole.<lb/>
Take one of that class of books to which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches specially directed attention, a book, say,
<col>190</col>
with an issue of 250 copies at a price of thirty guineas. When the publisher contemplates the issue of that book he enters into most minute and careful calculations of the cost of production. He scrutinises the quality of the paper in order to sec what quality he can afford to put into the book, and, of course, the cost of production varies according to the particular paper chosen. He settles the style of printing which will be adopted in the book, and again the cost varies according to the choiceness and elegance of the type which is adopted. He knows the binding in which the book will be made up, and he knows the remuneration he will have to give to the author1 or the compiler. He knows also the cost of printing and preparing the book for distribution. All these numerous items, which are most elaborately calculated, go to make up the average cost of production of each copy of the book. Before launching the enterprise he questions how many copies can be usefully produce, and at what price can be put the book on the market. Say an issue of 250 copies is contemplated. He knows that if he publishes an issue of 250 copies he will have to give away ten, or probably more, and he must fix a price, for the other 240 which will repay him the whole cost of production, besides providing him with the reasonable profit which he expects to secure from the enterprise. If the price is fixed at thirty guineas, that price for the 240 copies sold will have to pay for the cost of production and the publisher's remuneration in respect of the whole 250 copies produced. Therefore the publisher is no more in himself the bearer of this burden than the maker of the paper on which the book is printed, the founder of the type in which it is dressed, the binder who makes up the volume for the market, or any other person who contributes in some way to the production of the book. Ultimately, you may be sure, the price which will be paid by purchasers of the book will be a price which will cover the cost of, and provide a profit upon, the whole issue. If instead of having to make 240 copies produce by their sale the cost of production of 250 copies the publisher had the privilege of selling the whole 250 copies, the effect would be that he would be able to sell the book for &#x00A3;30 instead of thirty guineas. I hope I have now made it clear to your Lordships that it is the purchaser and not the publisher who really bears the burden
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0100"/>
<col>191</col>
of the privilege enjoyed by these Universities and Colleges.<lb/>
The question comes to this, Is it beneficial that such a tax should be laid on the purchasers of these books, making them a little more expensive, though not appreciably more in the case of ordinary books, in order that the Universities may have the privilege of receiving them? The noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Cromer) mast forgive me if I say&#x2014;the noble Earl opposite has already referred to it&#x2014;that he appears to have a most limited notion of what the function of a University is, and who are the persons who study in it. You would think he had not so much as a sixth form in his contemplation when he spoke of the books which should be supplied to a University for the purposes of study and instruction. The reproduction of the Bridgwater Gallery pictures in photogravure, produced at twenty guineas, is just the sort of book that ought to be supplied to a University. The Universities of Cambridge and Oxford are now the resort of students from all parts of the world, especially America who come there to enjoy the privileges of study which they find they can obtain in a somewhat calmer atmosphere and amid better surroundings than are possible in London, though, of course, great facilities are at their command in the metropolis. You find at the Universities students of all classes of subjects. Many of them are students of the fine arts; and what could be better for a person really engaged, say, in a study of the great Masters, identifying their production, studying their styles, and otherwise getting up the history of Italian or other paintings&#x2014;what could be better than for him to be supplied with such books as that which reproduces the treasures of Bridgwater House? Such a book enables him to study the pictures at his leisure and, having addressed his attention to them in that way, he will probably desire afterwards to see the pictures themselves on the walls of Bridgwater House. Such books are a part of the range of material necessary in a University if it is to discharge its functions in any special and satisfactory manner.<lb/>
I may refer in this particular, especially in connection with the study of art, to the recent action taken by the Slade Professor of Fine Art, who has now given up his profession. He is offering a considerable
<col>192</col>
amount on the part of himself, and soliciting endowments on the part of others, to establish chairs in the allied professions of fine arts in the University of Cambridge, so as to make it more than hitherto a place for the study of the history and development of art, though it has not been weak in that respect in the past. I may speak in my own person, because I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in my earlier years, and after I took my degree I was a very frequent visitor to the library at the Fitzwilliam Museum. There are excellent rooms, an ample service, and an admirable library, and one was able to study there the whole history of Italian and German art at leisure, and to one's great satisfaction. If the argument is good that institutions should be maintained as general places of study, then the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and, I take the word of my noble friend opposite, the University of Dublin in the same way, do supply particular centres where these studies can be maintained. The question, I repeat, is not one of taxing the publishers. I could scarcely repress my resentment when I heard the suggestion that the publishers are enduring this tax, and that they are paying 3 per cent. out of profits in order to bear it. The fact is, as I have shown, that it is a tax on an entirely different class of persons&#x2014;on the customers. In conclusion, may I express the belief that the arguments, if examined impartially, will be found to be strongly in favour of maintaining the privileges as they exist and should remain.</membercontribution></p>

If any reasonable arrangement could be made I would rather not be found voting against the privileges of the University of which I have the honour to be a member. On the other hand, I do think the publishers have a real grievance, and I hope there may be some indication from the noble Viscount opposite that reasonable terms may be arranged, as I would rather not vote against a provision which is in the interests of the Universities.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00811"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am a, young member of this House but a fairly old member of Parliament, and perhaps your Lordships will allow me to say that never in the whole course of my Parliamentary experience did I listen to a more illuminating debate. We have had every point of view presented in what is the perfection of Parliamentary style&#x2014;brief and with full knowledge&#x2014;and at every stage there has come a question which has brought out a new aspect of the discussion. The noble and learned Earl opposite has just put a very pregnant question which, I think, has been too much lost sight of. It is all very well for my noble friend Lord Courtney to say that the publishers do not pay for the books. The publishers think they pay; that is obvious from what they have said. It does seem to me that if they have to pay more for producing each copy of a book, which upon even the hypothesis of my noble friend they must, then they do have to pay, and as they have to raise the price they lose chances of selling. The fact remains that for this or other reasons that very capable and well instructed profession thinks this is a very heavy burden upon it, and I have great sympathy with the view put by the noble and learned Earl opposite that the publishers should be considered in this matter. The noble Earl opposite, Lord Curzon, who so admirably sustains the great position of Chancellor of the University of Oxford, has given us a very powerful presentation of the case for the Bodleian Library. He said in the course of his speech truly enough that this is in many respects a new point, and that it was not included by the Government in their Bill as it was originally framed. That is so, and it was not included because it is a question really of very great difficulty, a question in which interests conflict, and in which it was extremely difficult for the Government, who did not wish to overload their Bill, thorny enough as it was without it, with this most thorny of points. But it has been raised now, and a decision has to be come to.<lb/>
The view of the Government is that it is not a matter in which the Government as such should take a part. We propose to have the benefit of opinions in this House as to what decision should be come to on the point. Therefore in what I am going to say I am speaking for myself individually, and it may be that some of my friends and
<col>194</col>
colleagues who sit on this Bench will not, if my noble friend goes to a Division, vote in the same Lobby as I shall. The noble Earl opposite discussed this&#x2014;and I think it was a defect in his argument&#x2014;too much as though the proposal were to exclude the great libraries of the Universities from the possession of books which they ought to have. I entirely sympathise with my noble friend behind me (Lord Courtney) in thinking that you ought to take the widest view of the contents of a University library&#x2014;the widest view, that is, in point of quality. I do not think you ought to take, a restricted view of the books to be delivered to such an institution, and I do not believe the noble; Earl on the Cross Benches meant to limit them in that way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00812"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Certainly not; I quite agree with what the noble Viscount says.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00813"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I have interpreted the noble Earl rightly. I feel sure, speaking as one who has had to do with Universities in his time and has to do with them now, that; no conception can be wide enough of the quality of the library of a University. At the same time, that is not a reason for thinking that a University should be overloaded with what, from the point of view of a University library, is often rubbish. It is no reason for thinking that every book published should be put in a University library. The noble and learned Lord asked, me what was the title of these four libraries other than the British Museum to the delivery of copies. It is given in Talfourd's Act, which provides that while in the case of the British Museum the publisher is bound to deliver, he is only bound to deliver those books which, are demanded by the University libraries. If a rational system had grown up, the librarians at the Universities would have looked at the catalogues from the various publishers, and would have written for those books which they wanted. Then I do not think any question would have arisen, even if they had asked for expensive editions. But that is not what they do. They put in a sort of omnibus demand for every book that appears. A clerk apparently makes out a list from the catalogue and demands every book, whatever its utility.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00820"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I am told that every book is asked for. That must form a heavy tax upon the publishers. I do feel that; and while sympathising thoroughly with the view that every book which is of what i may call University quality&#x2014;of value for the purpose of education taken in its widest sense&#x2014;should go to those libraries, there must be enormous quantities of books which are demanded and sent which are of no value from this point of view, and never ought to be asked for. This grievance has arisen because of the practice of demanding every book. I do think that that is a difficulty with which we ought to try to deal. Whether there is any other way of dealing with it than by excluding certain classes of books I am not sure. In the case of the Welsh National Library, what is proposed is that the Board of Trade should have power to exclude certain classes of books. There are large classes of books which certainly ought to be excluded&#x2014;catalogues, time tables, sixpenny novels&#x2014;but which at present go to such libraries. What is done with them, whether they are sold, given away, or destroyed, I do not know. It may be possible to make a classification&#x2014;to draw up a clause which will go some way in that direction. I should be very sorry if this clause were to exclude books merely because of their expensiveness, but there are many expensive books which cannot be of any value to the Universities. 1 am speaking of classes of books which obviously on the face of them are not adapted for University purposes.<lb/>
I have put very shortly my own individual view. I have not asked my noble friend beside me (Viscount Morley) whether he agrees with me or not. He may take another view. But we feel that this is a question on which we should like the House to give its advice, and I hope that advice
<col>196</col>
will be got in the form of a Division taken on the Amendment of the noble and learned Lord. If the House, by voting for the Amendment, thinks that something ought to be done, then I should propose that between now and Report we should set to work to see whether the Amendment requires to be put into shape in order to obtain the object, at which I, for one, aim, of giving to the Universities every book they ought to have, and excluding others which on their face are not so adapted. Should your Lordships decide in favour of the Amendment, we will set to work and see in what form it is best to make this provision. I should think, in any event, the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord is a right one, that any order made by the Board of Trade on this subject should lie on the Table of both Houses of Parliament and should be subject to being made inoperative by an Address from either House. Unless both Houses concur in that order, at any rate at the present time, it would not be well to let the University libraries be exposed to any risk.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00821"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I stand before your Lordships in an unwonted capacity&#x2014;as a member of the Board of Trade. I do not know who the other members are, or whether they ever meet. I have never heard of a meeting, and I believe there is some doubt in the popular mind as to what that Board consists of. But I have been wondering during this debate whether my hitherto undiscovered functions have not at last been found, and possibly it may devolve, as it did two or three centuries ago, upon the occupant of my office to decide by a new form of censorship as to the admission or non-admission of particular books to particular portals. I have listened with the greatest interest to the speech just delivered on behalf of His Majesty's Government, who have declined to express any opinion on this point in favour or not in favour of their own Bill. I want to stand by the Government Bill. I believe the Bill to be, on the whole, and notwithstanding many difficulties, a reasonable and fair arrangement. But, if it requires amendment, why should we before the Report stage make a change in it which would <i>prima facie</i> give it a totally different character in order that we may afterwards modify it in some way? If alterations are required on Report, let them be made in the Bill as it now stands. I confess that in
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0103"/>
<col>197</col>
my own mind all the arguments I have heard&#x2014;to my great misfortune I had an engagement which made it impossible for me to hear the noble Lord on the Cross Benches&#x2014;but all I have heard since getting back to the House makes me believe that the Bill as it stands is reasonably good. We had better keep to it; as it is. We surely need not pass this Amendment in order to make an attempt to bring about some discrimination as to the books which ought or ought not to be added to the libraries in the great Universities of the Kingdom. I think the proposals as they stand are based on sound principles. I quite admit there may be particular cases in which publishers are rather hardly used. They may find it an expensive thing to carry out the injunction the Bill contains. But, as Lord Courtney has pointed out to-night, the publishers have their remedy from the British public who purchase books of an expensive kind, and I believe the burden will in the end fall upon the shoulders of the British public whatever decision we arrive at. Therefore I venture to hope the House will support the Government, and that the Government at this stage at least, and pending the possibility of some Amendment on Report, will adhere to their own Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I venture to suggest that that would be a very dangerous thing to do so far as the Universities are concerned. The Amendment, in my humble opinion, proposes something which the noble Earl (Lord Curzon) sitting beside me&#x2014;and I quite agree with him&#x2014;thinks is perfectly unworkable. That the Board of Trade should select and determine the books which ought to go to the University libraries seems to me a grotesque suggestion. We understand that that particular method is not necessarily to be adhered to, but I do think the House should have some indication, if it is to accept an Amendment of this sort, of a workable scheme for carrying out this most difficult operation.</membercontribution></p>

It is impossible, if one claim can be made, to deliver within one month of the written demand for parts which are not yet published and will not be published for many months. The several Amendments which I propose, beginning with this one, are to make it clear how that demand should be met in the case of encyclop&#x00E6;dias, &amp;c, which are published over a lengthy period. I think, subject to any corrected drafting, these Amendments meet the difficulty. I do not know whether I need elaborate the point.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00835"><member>THE EARL OF GALLOWAY</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to leave out subsection (2) of Clause 15. The noble Lord said: After the Division that has just taken place I do not think I should trouble your Lordships by moving this Amendment. As your Lordships have rejected the smaller part you are not likely to accept the larger. At the same time I want to point out that in the course of this debate one thing has been overlooked, and that is the interest of the author. A good deal has been said about the publisher, who can always take care of himself. It is the author who will suffer from this, in spite of what Lord Courtney said, and I hope the noble Viscount who has charge of the Bill will, on Report, bring in something or other which will help to meet the difficulty. It is a very small House which is voting on this question, and I feel quite sure that when it is known throughout the country that
<col>200</col>
individuals have to pay these large sums of money for the sake of these different institutions it will be seen that it is unfair, and that the country ought to pay for it. In the circumstances I shall not move the Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00838"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> proposed an Amendment to insert, after the word "alterations" in subsection (7) of Clause 15, the words "other than petty or verbal alterations." The noble and learned Lord said: This is a very small Amendment, and I question myself whether it is necessary. It is to meet what may be a grievance of the publisher being called upon to give a second edition for nothing when only a petty or trivial verbal alteration is made.</p>

Take the word "verbal." A man publishes substantially the same work but improves his style, and it may make a very great difference to the book. He may produce a very much more valuable edition than the first edition, and yet the changes are only verbal. In that case the library would be deprived of the book. When you come to the word "petty," it is again very difficult to tell, because the mere addition of a foot-note may make all the difference to the value of a work.</membercontribution></p>

A distinction of a marked character was drawn between artistic works and those which are not artistic. The principle was this: extended posthumous production may safely be given in the case, of works of which the originals apart from reproduction are comparatively worthless. The manuscript of a book is a sufficiently obvious illustration. It is of no special value, and there is, as a rule, no reason for keeping it hidden. But in cases such as paintings and sculpture, and works of art generally, the original is valuable itself apart from the copyright, and such works may very well be hidden from the public in private collections. We think it is not good policy to put a premium upon such a proceeding. We do not want to encourage people to hide a picture away.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00876">The noble and learned Lord said: This Amendment deals with a point which was referred to both in the Report on which the Bill was drawn and in the notes prepared by the draftsman upon it. It raises the question of the position of the proprietor or owner of an author's unpublished manuscript after his death. There are
<col>204</col>
cases in which a contest may arise between a man's representative and the person to whom he has left his manuscripts by will. It does not necessarily follow that the copyright goes with them. The copyright might belong to his personal representatives, whereas the manuscript itself might belong to the person to whom it was bequeathed. The object of the Amendment is to provide, in the case of an author's unpublished manuscript, that proprietorship should be <i>prima facie</i> proof of possession of the copyright. The point was considered by the Committee, who recommend [page 19 of their Report] that the provision which provides that the copyright is to be the property of the proprietor of the author's manuscript&#x2014;that is the provision as it at present stands&#x2014;should be altered, and that the mere possession of the manuscript should not be conclusive proof of the copyright being with the holder of the manuscript; in other words, that it should only be <i>prima facie</i> proof.

I would ask your Lordships to allow me to read the clause to you. [The noble Earl read the clause as set out above.] This to me is a most extraordinary clause to proceed from this Government. It is a piece of pure retaliation, as I understand it, and in my humble judgment it is a piece of very wise retaliation, but, as we know, retaliation is <i>anathema maranatha</i> to His Majesty's Government, if Lord Ridley were here I am sure he would give his blessing to this
<col>206</col>
clause and congratulate His Majesty's Government on their conversion. I have observed that His Majesty's Government deal with this question of retaliation just exactly as it happens to suit their purpose at the moment. Let me give them an instance which occurs in the immediately preceding clause, which refers to the Patents Act of 1907. As we all know, that Act was entirely a Tariff Reform Act, just such an Act as Tariff Reformers would have passed. And here on this occasion we have Clause 23 inserted in this Bill. Therefore I hope that His Majesty's Government will not in future take up such an absolutely irreconcilable line against Tariff Reform&#x2014;indeed, they do not, as I said before, when it suits their purpose. I am not going to ask them to strike this clause out. Far from it. I think they have acted very wisely and very properly; it will keep foreign nations on good terms with His Majesty's Government in this matter of copyright;: At the same time I think it is rather a strange clause to originate with His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00898"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Earl opposite does His Majesty's Government an injustice from several points of view. In the first place, His Majesty's Government is not so peaceful as is contended. Secondly, the instances he has taken are not very fortunate instances. I cannot find the analogy with Tariff Reform. Tariff Reform may or may not be a good thing, but the Patents Act of 1907 was a very different Act. A patent is a monopoly, and what we said was that we were not any more going to let, people? take out patents in this country which deprived other people of the right of making things unless they conformed to certain conditions, one of which was that they manufactured them here. That is not anything like Tariff Reform. The Patents Act is simply a restriction on an existing right of monopoly&#x2014;it is rather Free Trade; it encourages free trade in patents. It says that if an applicant for a patent does not agree to manufacture the article in this country he should not be allowed to prevent other people from manufacturing the article here.</membercontribution></p>

We said it was quite right that anybody who published a book in this country, even if he is a foreigner, should get the protection which the law gives to British subjects. We put the foreigner on the same footing. According we say in this clause, "If you come here and publish your book here we will treat you just as well as any one of our own subjects." But we say to anybody who will not do that, who maltreats our people by refusing the benefit of the Copyright laws, "If you come here you cannot expect to get the benefit of the Copyright law."

I do not think I need go into the merits any more than they were gone into last week. I have been prompted to recommend the adoption of this clause to your Lordships owing to the exceptional circumstances of the case which I consider exist
<col>214</col>
in Belfast. The clause is practically in the form now in which I held it in my hand last week when I first mentioned it to your Lordships. The actual form in which I held it was the form in which it was originally circulated. It has since, however, been slightly amplified in order to remove a doubt which it was felt by all parties might arise under the definition of the phrase "public health rate." I understand that the railway companies are agreed that the clause carries out what the Belfast Corporation offered, though, of course, they are not satisfied, as we all know, with the. actual settlement; and, of course, their case by any action they have taken in this matter is in no way prejudiced as regards any future action they may take in other Bills that may come before your Lordships' Committees. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00964">Moved, That this House do not insist upon the Amendment to which the Commons have disagreed, but propose the following new clause in lieu thereof: "In respect of any rate levied by the Corporation for defraying any expenses of the Corporation, which at the passing of this Act were defrayed out of that portion of the Borough Rate or Fund then known as the Public Health Rate or Fund, and in respect of any increase of, or addition to, the General Purposes Rate which may be made for any of the purposes of this Act, all lands used as a railway constructed under the powers of any Act of Parliament shall be assessed and liable in the proportion of one-fourth part only of the net annual value of such lands."&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Donoughmore.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00965"><member>VISCOUNT CHURCHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the statement on the last occasion of my noble friend the Lord Chairman that he considered that any further opposition on behalf of the railway companies would lead to the abandonment of this Bill by the Belfast Corporation, and in view of the fact that undoubtedly the Bill gives powers to the Corporation which are very urgently needed and of vital necessity, the railway companies concerned have desired me to say that they have decided not to press opposition to this measure further. The question, however, is of much wider importance; it is, in fact, of great importance to the whole of the railway interests in this country as well as in Ireland. I am sorry to say that in arguing this question expressions have at different
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0112"/>
<col>215</col>
times been used which might imply that the exemptions which are sought for by the railway companies are in themselves unreasonable. The principle of allowing railway companies in urban districts what is known as the three-fourths exemption with respect of rating of the actual railway lines has been recognised by Parliament ever since the inception of general sanitary legislation, and the few exceptions which exist, of which Belfast is one, are anomalies arising out of peculiar and particular local legislation. I must therefore say, my Lords, that had the companies thought that in this expression of opinion the Lord Chairman was in any way supporting this view, we should have felt it our duty to oppose it by every means in our power in the hope of persuading your Lordships to reject this suggestion. But the Lord Chairman informs me that in advising the House to accept this proposed compromise he wishes in no wise to give support to this particular view, and in those circumstances the railway companies have decided not to press the matter further on the present occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00966"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of what the noble Viscount has just said, I think it desirable to state that from my point of view I greatly regret that the matter has not been thoroughly discussed, because I think it might have been shown to your Lordships that the special exemption which the railway companies claim is against the law in Ireland and against the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation over which Lord Balfour of Burleigh presided. I think it could also be shown that no such exemption as the noble Lord has claimed for railway companies exists in London; and it might also, I think, be shown that the cases in Ireland in which exemptions are allowed do not, when really examined, support the contention of the noble Lord. However, as matters have reached the present stage, I can only express my regret that circumstances do not permit of the whole case being fully argued.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00967"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in considering the position at which this question has arrived, I think we are all agreed that the proper course is that recommended by the Lord Chairman. At the same time, I should like to express my regret that the other House was not able to accept an
<col>216</col>
Amendment which I venture to think was a perfectly fair one. I am afraid I must disagree with Lord MacDonnell in what he said on that subject, though I fully bow to his great knowledge of Irish affairs. I cannot help thinking that the general law as laid down in Ireland is extremely clear. The Committee, at all events, could find no reason why what the noble Earl the Lord Chairman has described as an anomaly should exist in the case of Belfast. I venture to think that great care is required in dealing with railway companies at the present time. Demands are being made upon railway companies which are very likely to eventuate in great concessions being asked from them, and I cannot help thinking that it is the duty of both Houses, as far as lies in them, to weigh very carefully the conditions under which railway companies are dealt with by Parliament, in order to make sure that while, on the one hand, Parliament is anxious that railway companies should make concessions to meet the spirit of unrest, Parliament, on the other hand, does not press them unduly on the side of the contributions they are called upon to make to public authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00968"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this case is a very instructive one as to the method by which we proceed and the method in which changes in important matters of practice are brought about. Here is a sort of compromise passing through without opposition, with which I venture to say no one of the parties concerned is absolutely satisfied. It is perfectly clear that the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees does not think that on its broad merits, except, as he said, of exceptional circumstances, this is a wise change to make. The noble Lord opposite, who was Chairman of the Committee which adjusted the clause that went down to another place, is not satisfied. The railway companies, as represented by the noble Viscount, are clearly not satisfied, and there are other persons who are not satisfied, of whom the noble Lord opposite (Lord MacDonnell) was the mouthpiece. He said that the whole custom as now existing was contrary to law, and he made an allusion to the Report of the Local Taxation Commission over which I had the honour to preside.<lb/>
I have also at intervals had to deal with this matter from the position occupied by the noble Earl the Lord Chairman, and I can see, reading between the lines,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0113"/>
<col>217</col>
exactly what has happened. A hard case is pleaded, and owing to the very great hardship of that case and the exceptional circumstances a new departure is made and a sort of compromise suitable to those particular circumstances is, if not agreed to, at any rate passed. Well, somebody comes along with a slightly different set of circumstances in a subsequent year and says, "Oh, here is a precedent in the case of Belfast." And they say it will do for, it may be, Liverpool, or Manchester, or Glasgow, or Birmingham, and it is very difficult for any one in the position of the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees to go into all the circumstances and make sure that the precedent is on the same lines. Therefore I want to put in a word of caution, not on behalf of any particular interest, whether corporation or railway company, but really for the sake of having these sort of changes considered on broad principles, and not so much on the exceptional circumstances. It may be that some particular privilege which is possessed by a railway company or a corporation is attacked by those against whose interest it seems to be, and it may be that something in that particular provision was condemned by the Local Taxation Commission, but you must not plead for a particular change of this kind on the authority of that Commission unless you are going to take the whole of the reform in local taxation of which this was a part.<lb/>
I am not going to oppose what is suggested now, but I do want to put in a word of caution, in regard to this being pleaded as a precedent, that we must take great care that by pleading a series of precedents we do not break down the whole position of rating of railway companies in this particular matter of sanitary provisions. I would venture to say that in this matter the position of railway companies is very hard, because they have no vote, and it is very doubtful whether they get any direct benefit from all these sanitary provisions, and yet if their <i>quasi</i> exemption is to be broken down they will be penalised to a very large extent. Therefore upon the ground of the undesirability of making exceptions of this kind upon what is a well understood and general code, and further upon the ground of the grave doubts as to whether the change itself is expedient, I do hope that if we pass it to day it will not be pleaded as a precedent against railway companies in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-00969"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are disposed to welcome the compromise which has been reached between the Belfast Corporation and the railway companies, chiefly because this Bill contains clauses dealing with sanitation which were the outcome of an inquiry instigated by the Local Government Board in Ireland. As I daresay is known to your Lordships, the state of health in Belfast has been far from satisfactory in the past, and those clauses are regarded by the Local Government Board as essential to the hygiene of that city. Although one welcomes the compromise, I certainly agree with what has fallen from Lord Balfour of Burleigh that there is something rather unsatisfactory about it. It is quite true that there is a great deal to be said for the merits of the case when railway companies expect a certain rebate, but what is, I think, rather objectionable is the way in which their case is brought before Parliament. If they were to put forward a general Bill dealing with their position and attempt to get the Legislature to treat them with the consideration which they think they should obtain, that would be all very well, and this House would be disposed to consider the case of the railway companies on its merits, and I think there is a good deal to be said for them. But I think it is a little objectionable that railway companies should, as it were, lie in wait, and then when a corporation comes before Parliament with a general Bill, dealing not specifically at all with railway interests or not adversely affecting railway interests, should seize the opportunity and practically hold the corporation up to ransom, and, in effect, be in a position to prevent the passage of the Bill unless the corporation comes to terms with them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00970"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but if corporations never held railway companies up to ransom we should probably get on a little better than we do at the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00971"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I was speaking generally. As to precedents, there is a precedent in the case of Dublin, which I consider a very bad precedent.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0010P0I0114"/>
<col>219</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00973"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord did not consider it a precedent, but the railway companies were encouraged by the success which attended similar action on the part of railway companies in the case of Dublin. I think we shall agree that it is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the situation. As far as this particular case is concerned I would remind Lord Balfour, who says that corporations are apt to hold railway companies up to ransom, that in Belfast, owing to peculiar circumstances, the railway companies have for the last thirteen years enjoyed a privilege which they were not entitled to enjoy in strict legality. I may say, with regard to what fell from Lord MacDonnell, that it is perfectly true to state that there is no general Act in Ireland exempting railway companies from rates or granting them any preferential conditions. As a matter of fact, there are only two Acts under which railway companies do obtain preferential treatment. The first is the Towns Improvement Act of 1854, the provisions of which were availed of by a great many&#x2014;I think by nearly all&#x2014;of the small towns in Ireland. But in that case the preferential treatment only applies to lighting and scavenging, quite minor matters; and I believe that in regard to Belfast the original case which the companies tried to make out was that they were to get a rebate of all rates, including the police rate. Surely the noble Lord cannot say that railway companies do not benefit from the protection of the police.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00974"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Railway companies do not get any deduction on that rate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00975"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: But they asked for it; and in that respect they went a great deal further in their demand than can be claimed in the precedent of the Towns Improvement Act, 1854. The other Act under which railway companies claim rebate is the Act of 1878, which applies only to urban sanitary districts, and in that case the companies are able to obtain a rebate of three-fourths on the public health rate alone. But with those two exceptions there is no rebate in Ireland for railway companies in any municipal borough or in any rural district, and so it is not right to say that there is a generally recognised principle of law in Ireland under which railway companies are entitled to a rebate. I think some misconception has arisen because
<col>220</col>
it was thought by many members of your Lordships' House that the claim on the part of the railway companies in this case was merely to remove an anomaly which existed in Belfast only, or in Belfast and a few other towns. The Government, however, do not wish to say anything which would upset the compromise which has been reached. Although, perhaps, not quite satisfactory in principle, I think it is not quite unsatisfactory in practice, and if the Bill goes through as it is now proposed to amend it, His Majesty's Government see no objection to it whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00976"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: I should like to be allowed to correct the noble Lord on one point. He referred to the police rate, but if he will look at the details of the police rate in Ireland he will see that it is by no means in the nature of a police rate as generally understood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00977"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I only speak again in order to make two points clear. The first was the point just mentioned by Lord Welby, and it reacts on what was said by Lord Balfour, who is anxious that this case should not be quoted as a precedent. I am quite satisfied that there is no parallel whatever between the rating system as worked in Ireland and the rating system as worked in England, Scotland and. Wales, and I am also satisfied that it would be very difficult indeed for a railway company to draw a precedent from the decision that your Lordships are taking this afternoon that would help them at all in any case which might be before a Committee of your Lordships' House at some future time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00978"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Or for a corporation to draw a precedent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00979"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: It would be difficult for either side to draw a precedent. The actual names of the rates are so different in Ireland from what they are on this side of the Channel that it is almost impossible to draw a parallel. For instance, the police rate has been mentioned. I understand that in England, Scotland, and Wales the police rate is what it is supposed to be, but in Belfast the police rate includes public lighting, fire brigade, street widening, and public conveniences, and I think it would be very difficult to draw a precedent from a rate of that kind when it is called a police
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0115"/>
<col>221</col>
rate and apply it to a police rate in this country. I wish to make this second point quite clear. My noble friend behind me spoke of a compromise reached between the Belfast Corporation and the railway companies. This is a compromise reached between the corporation and the noble Lord who was Chairman of the Committee who gave the decision. The railway companies are not parties to the compromise, and I do not think anything would have made them parties to the compromise.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SALFORD HUNDRED COURT OF RECORD<lb/> BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00984" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00985">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00986"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the object of this Bill is to amend the Salford Hundred Court of Record Act, 1868, which amalgamated into one Court two previously existing Courts&#x2014;namely, that for the Hundred of Salford and that for the borough of Manchester. This Act also extended the jurisdiction of the Salford Hundred Court into a number of places outside the limits of those two which I have mentioned. The Court has always worked well and been popular in Manchester, but its jurisdiction was resented by certain places outside. Bury and Oldham, for example, obtained exemption from it in private Acts, and certain other places obtained exemption, in small cases where the County Court had jurisdiction, under Orders in Council, and these exemptions are made statutory in the Bill. There have been certain complaints made for some time past against this Court, the principal of which regarded the scale of
<col>222</col>
costs, which was considered to be a great deal too high, and also the great inconvenience which was caused to various persons owing to the transference of default judgments to distant County Courts.<lb/>
On the last day of October, 1910, therefore, it was decided to appoint a Departmental Committee to inquire into the whole matter, and this Committee, which consisted of Lord Mersey, Mr. McCall (the Attorney-General of the Duchy of Lancaster), and Mr. F. Maddison, held eight sittings, examined a number of witnesses, and considered a considerable mass of documents, with the result that they made a Report on December 22 containing ten recommendations, among which the most important were as follow. First, they recommended that the territorial jurisdiction of the Court should be limited to the areas of the County Courts of Manchester and of Salford, but that jurisdiction should attach wherever a material part of the cause of action arose within those areas, and where the Court was satisfied that the case could be more conveniently tried there than elsewhere. Secondly, they recommended that in so far as it was possible the scale of costs should be assimilated to that which exists in the County Court. Thirdly, they recommended that the High Court system of applying for speedy and summary judgment should be recognised. I should, perhaps, say that a reservation was made by one member of the Committee, although he signed the Report, to the effect that in his opinion the whole business of the Court might with advantage be transferred to the County Courts. Whatever may be said for or against this proposition, it could not, very well have been dealt with on the present occasion, for the simple reason that this Court does not stand by itself. It is on a similar footing with various other Courts throughout the country, amongst which I might mention the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Derby Court of Record, and the Lord Mayor's Court. Therefore, before considering the question of the abolition of the Salford Hundred Court, it should be considered whether all these other Courts should be abolished or whether they should all be retained. Consequently, it was thought that the best course to pursue was, pending any consideration which there might be with regard to this point, to amend the law with regard to this
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0116"/>
<col>223</col>
particular Court, in so far as it was possible, with a view to meeting the grievances which had been found in the working of the Court.<lb/>
This Bill was therefore founded upon the Report of the Departmental Committee. It passed its Second Reading in the House of Commons on July 23, and was then referred to a Select Committee of five, including the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Sir Frederick Low, K.C., Mr. Gill, and one of the Members for Bolton. Some objections, it is true, were threatened with regard to its further progress, but the Chancellor of the Duchy met the various representations and made several concessions. Amendments were introduced into the Bill in order to meet these objections, and finally the only petition which was actually presented against the Bill was withdrawn. The Bill then passed its Third Reading in another place, and I hope that in view of the fact that it can be said of this Bill that it is entirely a non-contentious measure your Lordships will be disposed to give it a Second Reading this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE IRISH RAILWAY STRIKES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00993"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> rose to call attention to the late railway strike in Ireland; and to move to resolve, "That this House is of opinion that the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland should have been at his post during the continuance of the strike when life and property were in danger, and when the trade of the country was paralysed."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00994">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the matter which I wish to bring before your Lordships this evening would have been better brought forward in the House of Commons, but there was no chance of getting a day there for such a debate in consequence of the Government taking the whole time of the House for the National Insurance Bill. I do not wish to treat this in any way as a Party question, but to allude to the inaction of the Government during the late railway strikes in Ireland and the absence of the Chief Secretary during the whole of those troubles. We had nineteen days of strikes in Ireland. The principal strike was on the Great Southern and Western Railway; there was a strike at Dundalk on the Great Northern Railway; there was a complete strike at North Wall, which prevented the shipment of cattle and disorganised the whole of the cattle trade of the country, our most important industry; and there was also a slight strike at Amiens Street, the terminus of the Great Northern Railway. The strike began by a claim put forward by the men of the Great Southern and Western Railway as to the goods traffic the company should handle. The object of the strike was not to redress any grievances of the men. It was a deliberately planned conspiracy to deter the railway companies from complying with their statutory obligations as carriers for the public. As such I contend&#x2014;and I am sure many of your Lordships will agree with me&#x2014;that it was criminal and illegal in its inception, and called for the immediate and active intervention of the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00995">What did the Government do? They did nothing at all at the beginning of the strike.</p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0117"/>
<col>225</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00996">The Lord-Lieutenant was away; the Chief Secretary also was away, and he kept away during the whole of the strike. Under what is called "peaceful persuasion" the men who remained loyal to their employers were intimidated in the grossest manner and violence was used towards them. In the early days of the strike the Executive at Dublin Castle was embodied in the person of the Under-Secretary, and it is reported of him that he said that he had never known a more peaceful strike, and that the policy of the Government in respect of it would be to "keep the ring." That was a most unfortunate expression, and the worst of it was that it was made use of by the Press throughout the country and encouraged the strikers. Whether the Under-Secretary said it or not I do not know, but the statement was never contradicted. I do not mean to say that the minor officials at the Castle should be blamed and made scapegoats. You must remember that the Chief-Secretary was away and kept away. Protection was asked for by the directors of the Great Southern and Western Railway, and I will give your Lordships an instance of the wretched attempt which the Government made to offer protection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00997">The railway directors asked for protection for their engine drivers at Inchicore and at the railway works there. The Government gave them five policemen. These policemen patrolled this small town, and directly after them came the strikers frightening the women, threatening them in every possible way, and saying, "I wonder how your husbands will come home on the shutters." They broke windows in the houses of the sick, in fact, did very much what they chose. The chairman of the Great Southern and Western Railway, when interviewed by the Press, said that things were so bad he would not be responsible for keeping the line open&#x2014;in fact, if he did not get immediate protection the line would be closed down. I must draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that the whole of the branches were already closed down at that time. When that statement appeared in the Press, and only then, after a week of chaos, the Government and the military authorities consulted together and military protection was given. I cannot praise too highly the dispositions that were made by the military throughout the country. The termini were protected, and there was peace. Indeed it was time something was done, because a signal-box had already been fired into at Thurles, there
<col>226</col>
was intimidation and assault at the station in my own district, and there were also many Dublin cases. Where was the Chief Secretary? I do not know where he was. I hope he was enjoying himself; but we had not the smallest enjoyment at all in Ireland. There was no pleasure in living in the country during this time. You could not get goods sent you; you could not travel by the railways&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00998"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: You could not travel?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-00999"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: You could only travel by a very limited number of trains. I remember cases where people went to local stations, and. after waiting hours and hours, had to go home as there were no trains. Who, I ask, was the greatest striker of all? Why, the Chief Secretary himself. And he was different from other strikers because during all the time he was neglecting his duties he was receiving a very large salary. It is comforting to know that one of his colleagues in the Cabinet has quite a different idea of the duties of the Executive under such conditions. Speaking at Dundee on October 3, the night before the Irish strike was settled, Mr. Winston Churchill, who was then Home Secretary, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The duty of the Government, when such an emergency appears, is obvious. No Administration, Liberal, Tory, or Socialist, could neglect its duty or refuse it without being a traitor to its trust. The Government are bound to take the most effective measures in their power, first, to maintain order; secondly, to prevent intimidation; and, thirdly, to secure the working of the food supply. No other considerations could be so important, and no questions of the interests or a political Party, or of the popularity of a particular Party, or of the popularity of a particular Minister, could be allowed to weigh even for a moment."</quote>
The Irish Government did not attempt at the commencement of the strike to maintain order, they did not prevent intimidation, and so far as the working of the food supply was concerned, we had to look after ourselves. During the railway strikes there was a bread strike in Dublin, and people in many cases simply collared the bread carts, upset the loaves in the street, and helped themselves.<lb/>
I should like to say something with regard to the chief originator and promoter of these strikes, and tell your Lordships a little with regard to his record, and also what we understand were the relations between him and the Irish Government. The prime mover in this strike was a man named
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0118"/>
<col>227</col>
Larkin, who was tried before Mr. Justice Boyd and a common jury of the county of Dublin in June last for obtaining money by false pretences from quay labourers in Cork, and with diverting money so received from the object for which it was received. He was found guilty, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labour, and an application which was made to the King's Bench Division for a new trial in July was refused by Justices Gibson and Madden. As I say, he was sentenced in June to twelve months' hard labour, but was released by the Lord-Lieutenant after he had been in prison under three months and a-half. The beginning of the strike was a dispute in the timber trade, and the Great Southern and Western Railway men refused to handle the timber sent by the merchants involved. During that dispute it was strongly suggested by the Lord-Lieutenant that this man Larkin should meet one of the leading timber merchants and confer with him with regard to the troubles in the timber trade, but the suggestion was warmly resented by that merchant. This man Larkin is the editor of a paper published in Dublin called the <i>Irish Worker</i>, and there appeared in that paper on August 19 last an article from which I quote the following extract&#x2014;
<quote>"If a man deserted the British Army to fight for the Boers and was afterwards captured, he would be shot. When a man deserts front our ranks in time of war (for a strike is war between capital and labour), he on the same principle forfeits his life to us. If England is justified in shooting those who desert to the enemy, we also are justified in killing a scab."</quote>
That is nice sort of language to appear in a paper. I see the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack smiling. I do not think it is a matter to smile about. This is an incitement to murder, and&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01001"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Up to the present time the Government have totally ignored this language. They have taken no notice whatever of it. I have other complaints to make against the authorities at Dublin Castle. They took up exactly the same position as the Lord-Lieutenant did, for later in September they expressed a wish that some members of the timber trade should meet and discuss matters with this man Larkin. This was most politely
<col>228</col>
declined. Then during the strike on the Great Southern and Western Railway there was published in the <i>Irish Worker</i> an article headed, "Gentlemen Scabs at Inchicore," and in this article were set out the names and addresses of twelve young gentlemen serving in the engineering works at Inchicore who left their particular work for the time being in order to take the places of the men on strike. Their action was described in this paper as "discreditable and discreditable." What is more, this man Larkin, without let or hindrance, held a meeting at Inchicore and at this meeting repeated his violent language and actually went so far as to defy the Government to prosecute him. Sir William Goulding, chairman of the Great Southern Railway Company, sent a copy of the <i>Irish Worker</i> to the Lord-Lieutenant, and concluded his letter with these words&#x2014;
<quote>"Will you kindly inform me what action the Government are going to take for the protection of these citizens, in our service, to prevent this incitement against their loyalty, and whether criminal proceedings will be taken against those responsible for the publication?"</quote>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01006">Happily the strike is now over, but neither the Chief Secretary nor the Lord-Lieutenant had anything whatever to do with the arrangements that led to its termination. Do the facts that I have stated show that the authorities at Dublin Castle in charge of the government of the country helped to bring an end to this miserable affair? The directors of the companies remained firm, and the men have gone back to work under conditions imposed by the railway companies. Ninety per cent. have been taken back, and fifteen per cent. of those are in a lower grade. We are trying to forget all about this affair in Ireland; we are trying to forget Larkin and his methods of "peaceful persuasion," and we hope he will not trouble us again. In the Irish nature there
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0119"/>
<col>229</col>
is a lot of resiliency. We cannot, however, forget that our Chief Secretary deserted us in a time of trouble, and we certainly cannot forgive him. He was not there at his post as he should have been, and I venture to say he is the first Chief Secretary who has ever acted in such a way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01007"><i>Moved</i> to resolve, That this House is of opinion that the Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland should have been at his post during the continuance of the strike when life and property were in danger, and when the trade of the country was paralysed.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Mayo.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01008"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to add very few words to the remarks made by my noble friend, but as I was present in Ireland during the whole of the strike and had at least some personal knowledge of the events in my own locality, and naturally, having a great interest in what was taking place, ascertained what I could of what was passing in other places, I wish to say, without anticipating the explanation that may be given of what was actually done by the Government, that it did appear to most of us in Ireland at that time that from the beginning the measures taken by the Government were not sufficient, and that the situation was not adequately recognised.<lb/>
A private individual, of course, cannot know what was taking place in the councils of the Government; but, as far as I have been able to learn or obtain information, at the outset of the strike there was really hardly anything done to prevent intimidation and to secure the communication that is necessary for the life of the country. That was the very moment when assistance and protection was most required and would have been most effective. I say that because I am really convinced that the great bulk of the men, having, as is perfectly well known, no quarrel whatever with their employers, would have welcomed any opportunity of not going out; but, admiring as we do the qualities of our countrymen, we know in Ireland that their moral courage to resist pressure when pressure is brought upon them is not so great as in some other countries; and I am quite sure that if the bulk of the men employed by these railway companies in Ireland had been assured of protection, there would have been a
<col>230</col>
very small number who would not have continued to perform their duties. By lack of support at the beginning of the strike the crucial moment was lost when everything might have been saved. At a later stage there is no doubt that a measure of assistance was given, but from what I have heard I do not think it was quite adequate to the necessities of the case, and I believe even then that with more energy the strike might have ended sooner.<lb/>
I wish to call the attention of the House to the very serious situation that was created by this strike. The small country towns in Ireland suffered, and the poor especially suffered acutely. Supplies&#x2014;necesaries in some cases&#x2014;were lacking; trade stocks. Hour, and bacon could not be secured; small farmers could not sell their cattle because they could not be got away; and the situation was one in which I think they had a right to look to the Government. It was the public who suffered, and it was the public who sought protection, and I must say I do not think the public had quite the protection they were entitled to expect. I should in this connection like to say one word about the behaviour of the Irish people in this juncture, because I think too much credit cannot be given to them. From the very outset they recognised the indefensible character of the strike, and notwithstanding their sufferings&#x2014;I am talking of the very poor&#x2014;one and all of them supported the companies in holding out, because they were determined that pressure on them, which was the only pressure that could make the strike successful, should not in this case succeed.<lb/>
Speaking with no bitterness, I honestly hope there may be an explanation from the Government which will afford satisfaction. But we have waited for it a long time, and in view of the fact that no explanation has yet been forthcoming, though there have been many opportunities for it, we must be forgiven if we have some measure of doubt whether it will turn out to be altogether that which we hope for. As to the absence of the Chief Secretary, I do think that when a country is in the condition that Ireland was in, one would naturally have expected that the Minister responsible for the government of the country would have been taking an active part in all the measures thought
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0120"/>
<col>231</col>
proper to bring the strike to an end and to bring about industrial peace. I expected every day to see in the newspapers some reason given for the absence of the Chief Secretary. I do not approach this subject with any pleasure. Mr. Birrell is a personal friend of my own, and I had hoped for, and still hope for, a satisfactory explanation.<lb/>
In the Chief Secretary's absence the duties of dealing with the immediate situation devolved on a permanent public official. Though he was doubtless in communication with his Chief, the questions involved were questions of policy which must have changed almost from hour to hour. He had to act on the policy laid down, and really to do what was policy in applying it. I do not wish to say anything against Sir James Dougherty. I feel that his position was one in which a public servant ought not to be placed. Then there was that unfortunate expression which was attributed to Sir James Dougherty. If it was inspired, the attitude of "keeping the ring" in a dispute of this kind does account for a great deal of what we think we have a right to complain, and does require explanation. If you "keep the ring" between railway companies and their servants, what becomes of the public who suffer? It is they who have to be protected. I am sure we shall receive from the representative of the Government in this House information as to what took place, and possibly an explanation which may be satisfactory; but I do hope, even if that be not so, and it may not be so, there will be coupled with the explanation an expression of the Government's view in regard to policy which may reassure us should unfortunate circumstances of this character recur in any part of the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>

In some cases I myself have been the victim of the attack&#x2014;the noble Viscount opposite (Lord St. Aldwyn) and I are the only two men who have ever had the temerity or fortitude to be twice Chief Secretary for Ireland&#x2014;and in other cases I quite admit I have been the critic. Every point made by the noble Earl I have
<col>232</col>
heard made ever since I was first Chief Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01010"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: There have been no strikes before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01011"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the Chief Secretary was ever attacked before for being absent when there were troubles like these going on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01012"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: As the noble and learned Lord challenges me, I may say that I remember distinctly that in 1888, when the Coercion Act&#x2014;so called&#x2014;was in full operation, I commented in public on the absence of the then Chief Secretary from Ireland, and to the best of my knowledge and belief the reply of Mr. Balfour was that there was no reason why at Whittingehame he should not be able to superintend the administration of that famous Act as efficiently as if he had been at Dublin Castle. I have not got his exact words, but my memory of the incident is perfectly clear. I think the whole House will agree that the noble Earl who called attention to this matter to-day has not used the language of good taste when he talked of the Chief Secretary neglecting his duties while drawing a large salary. I think that is a kind of remark which is not worth making. In reply to my noble and learned friend on the Cross Benches, the idea that because the Chief Secretary was at Balmoral or Sheringham, or wherever Mr. Birrell happened to be, therefore the whole undivided responsibility was thrown on to the shoulders of the Under-Secretary&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01013"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: What I said was that the situation was changing from time to time. I specially said that the Under-Secretary was doubtless in communication with his Chief, but that he had to settle what were really questions of policy in applying the instructions he received.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01014"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: The answer is this, that Mr. Birrell was at one end of the telegraph wire the whole time, so I am assured by him, and was receiving hourly telegraphic communications from Dublin Castle. He knew everything that was done; in fact, he was as much responsible as if he had been inside the rather gloomy precincts of Dublin Castle all the time. Earlier in the year there were two or three strikes, and they were accompanied by violent looting and assaults,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0121"/>
<col>233</col>
and so forth. Was the Chief Secretary absent then? On the contrary, he was in Dublin attending to his duties and earning his salary. When the Chief Secretary was in Ireland the rioting was rather violent; when the Chief Secretary was not in Ireland there was no rioting at all. The argument may be drawn from that that it is a good thing for peace and order that the Chief Secretary should be absent.<lb/>
But, seriously, what has the noble Earl brought forward to-night which is not an exact description of what has been going on in this country, except that it has been in some ways more violent or more marked here? There are hardships inflicted by these strikes, and, of course, we all detest them and the sources of them. But do not let us be led into exaggeration. There was no incident in Ireland that was not perfectly common when the railway strike was going on in this country, and there were the same complaints here about the supineness and want of energy of the Government. I was rather astonished that my noble and learned friend on the Cross Bench quarrelled so violently with the expression about "keeping the ring." That is the accepted and recognised attitude of the Government in industrial strikes. The Government have to see that law and order are preserved. But the Government are not, therefore, on that account to go beyond their true and recognised sphere. The noble Earl opposite said that the criminal law ought to have been set in motion against Larkin for the odious and detestable things written in his newspaper. But the Government were advised in the first instance, by their Law Officers, that there was no certain evidence that this man was either the owner or the publisher of the newspaper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01015"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: He is the editor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01016"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: Towards the end of September the Government did have evidence that Larkin was responsible; but the Law Officers advised that there ought to be no prosecution unless the case was clear and certain. We should all agree with them in that. In the second place, they advised that the language which has been read by the noble Earl opposite, detestable as it was, was not, in the circumstances, indictable. Would anybody say that the Government should have acted
<col>234</col>
against their own Law Officers by commencing proceedings that could have had no profitable end? The noble Earl, Lord Mayo, used the word "conspiracy" very frequently in his reference to trades union combinations. Has any action been taken in England against these "conspiracies"? We are surrounded by conspiracies, according to the exaggerated description of the noble Earl.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl referred, at somewhat less length than I had expected, to the position of Larkin; for one of the Law Officers of the late Unionist Government has not scrupled to use most violent language about the association of the Executive Government in Ireland, or of Sir James Dougherty, and, I think, the Lord-Lieutenant, with Larkin. The Lord-Lieutenant has not seen Larkin for three or four years, and has not seen him at all during these strikes. It is also unfounded to say that Sir James Dougherty has been in close association with Larkin. Sir James Dougherty was asked by the timber merchants to intervene between them and the men, and when he applied to the men they said, "We cannot go unless you allow Larkin to come."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01017"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: The Lord-Lieutenant suggested that a leading timber merchant, whose letter I have in my pocket, should meet Larkin, and he indignantly refused to do so. The authorities at Dublin Castle desired one of the merchants, or a representative from the merchants, to meet Larkin.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01018"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that shakes my statement. Sir James Dougherty, very sensibly, saw these men. Whether he persuaded them to come to terms or not I do not recall at the moment, nor does it matter; but the association with Larkin was in no way culpable or worthy of any remark whatever. Some flagitious language has been put into the mouth of the Under-Secretary by Mr. Campbell&#x2014;the noble Earl has not reproduced it&#x2014;to the effect that he had recommended men who applied to him for protection, railway directors or timber merchants, to "Go and get a permit from Larkin." Could that be thought to be true for five minutes after what happened? I will tell your Lordships what happened. The statement, which was made in a speech or in a letter to <i>The Times</i>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0122"/>
<col>235</col>
by Mr. Campbell, was immediately contradicted and denied by the two gentlemen who knew all the facts. Even that was not accepted. The statement was repeated, and it has taken some effort to get a frank withdrawal of that most injurious and shameful charge.<lb/>
The noble and learned Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Desart) wants an explanation. He kept using the word explanation. My explanation is this, that the language of the Motion is extravagant. We have not heard anything from the noble and learned Earl or from the noble Earl opposite to show that life and property were in danger and that the trade of the country was paralysed. The trade of the country, I can well believe, was injured, but so it is here when we have a strike. It is one of the curses of a strike. Life and property were no more in danger than they are in any case of industrial warfare; probably a great deal less. There was not a single life lost, and what is very rare from my experience of Ireland, there was not even a head broken. Therefore does not that show that the exertions of the Government were successful in preventing these disturbances taking an overt form? There was no injury, so I am assured, to the property either of the railway companies or of the timber merchants beyond what is common to all industrial warfare.<lb/>
I do not know that I have anything more to say, but I will vouch for the force of the case I am presenting to the House. A meeting of the council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, a body comprising 500 or 600 members, was held on November 2, and a vote of censure of that inordinate length which is too common in Irish votes, whether of censure or of applause, was moved. Did this council of leading men pass that vote of censure? Would they have voted to-night for the noble Earl's Motion? On the contrary, the motion was not only rejected, but only twenty-three members of the council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce could be got to vote for that censure which the noble Earl is asking your Lordships to vote for to-night.<lb/>
One more citation. Every one who has taken an interest in Irish affairs is familiar with the name of Sir Horace Plunkett. He, again, is not a supporter of Mr. Birrell or of Mr. Birrell's Government. What did Sir Horace Plunkett say? He said, on the
<col>236</col>
occasion to which I have referred, and I commend his statement to the House&#x2014;
<quote>"Was there any evidence before their that would convince any reasonable man&#x2026;that the Government were less active in Ireland than on the other side of the water? He was not in the country at the time, but he had read the newspapers carefully, and the conclusion he had come to was that the strike, on the whole, although subject to unhappy influences here and there, was singularly free from violence, and had caused less suffering and less dislocation of business than had been experienced in other parts of the United Kingdom."</quote>
My Lords, with that deliberate declaration of opinion from a man so impartial I confidently leave the Motion to the judgment of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01019"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount will, I hope, not be greatly surprised if we regard his explanation&#x2014;for it was for an explanation we asked&#x2014;as not altogether a satisfactory one. He began, singularly enough, by suggesting that the charge brought by my noble friend behind me was, after all, only the kind of charge constantly brought against those who have held the high office of Chief Secretary. The noble Viscount seems to me altogether to misapprehend the gravity of the situation with which the Chief Secretary was confronted. It was an altogether special and unprecedented situation, and I venture to say that in the opinion of all right-thinking people the occasion was one when the head of the Executive Government in Ireland should have been at his post. The noble Viscount said, "Oh, but Mr. Birrell was at the other end of the telegraph wire, and that did just as well." My Lords, what was wanted on an occasion of that kind was that the conduct of the Executive should be of a nature to restore public confidence, and nothing could more restore confidence in such circumstances than the presence on the spot of the chief administrative officer of the Government. The Chief Secretary upon an occasion of that kind is very much in the position of the officer in command of the forces arrayed on the side of law and order in Ireland. I wonder whether the noble Viscount would suggest that a General Officer would be as likely to inspire his troops with confidence if he remained in his office at Pall Mall at the end of a telegraph wire, instead of being on the spot to guide and inspire them.<lb/>
The situation was, as my noble friend described it, an extremely serious one, and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0123"/>
<col>237</col>
there was this that, to my mind, made it exceptionally serious. In all the history of labour disputes I do not believe there has ever been a strike so entirely unprovoked and so wantonly set in motion. These railway men had no grievance against the railway companies. What they did was to espouse a quarrel between some firms engaged in the timber trade and their <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i>, and in order to back up and support the men engaged in that quarrel they plunged the whole country into the grievous troubles caused by the strike which took place. The noble Viscount seemed to think that my noble friend used exaggerated language when he spoke of the strike as having led to a paralysis of business. My noble friend was entirely within the mark. Paralysis expresses it exactly; and that paralysis and that dislocation of trade which took place affected not so much those living in the great centres of industry, but the humblest and most helpless people in the remotest parts of the country. The people who really felt the effects of the strike were such people as the peasants, who after driving their cattle many miles to market found that the fairs could not take place because there was no means of getting the cattle conveyed to the larger towns, and the fishermen, who found themselves unable to market their catch because the trains were not running.<lb/>
What was the duty of the Executive Government at such a moment? My noble friend quoted with great effect a remarkable speech delivered not long ago by the colleague of the noble Viscount who at the time held the office of Home Secretary. But may I be allowed to quote two or three lines from a more recent and more important deliverance by another of the noble Viscount's colleagues? May I read Mr. Asquith's words at the Mansion House the other evening? Speaking of industrial warfare he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Executive Government of the day has cast upon it two clear duties. First of all, it must exhaust all its available opportunities, without meddlesome and mischievous interference, to provide the machinery and to facilitate the methods of conciliation. And, next, it must maintain order, prevent and punish violence, and secure, so far as it can, the community at large against the stoppage of supplies and the suspension of services which are indispensably necessary for the maintenance of its everyday social life."</quote>
And then he ended&#x2014;
<quote>"These are duties which no civilised Government, however tangled may be the circumstances
<col>238</col>
of the hour, can afford to ignore or leave unperformed."</quote>
I could not ask for a more admirable or better expressed recapitulation of the duties of the Government of the day in the face of a serious labour dispute such as that with which we had to deal in Ireland.<lb/>
Those views appear to me to be doubly sound for two reasons. We have by recent legislation very greatly strengthened the position of these industrial combinations. By Acts now on the Statute Book we have given special immunity to individuals for acts which, if performed in other circumstances, would bring them within the reach of the arm of the law, and we have given immunity to the funds of the trades unions from claims for compensation to which, if they did not enjoy this special protection, they would unquestionably be liable. But, my Lords, surely these special privileges&#x2014;for they are privileges&#x2014;were given in the anticipation that they would be used in a reasonable and moderate spirit by these industrial combinations. They were given in the hope that the trades unions would exercise a restraining and moderating influence upon the men who till their ranks. But, my Lords, at this moment, so far as one is able to judge, the councils of the trades unions are directed by men who, far from exercising a moderating influence, spare no pains to inflame and embitter these conflicts. You have only to look at the publicly reported utterances of some of these leaders to see the kind of doctrines which are now being inculcated on the members of these trades unions&#x2014;open war upon capital, the refusal to enter into agreements, the claim of the right to repudiate agreements that have been entered into, and open incitement to crime and violence directed both against the employers of labour and against those men who have the moral courage to dissociate themselves from their fellow workers and stand aside when these disputes take place. All these things seem to me to double the obligation which lies upon the Government of the day to carry out to the letter the policy laid down by Mr. Asquith at the Mansion House. Now, my Lords, how was that policy carried out by the Executive at Dublin? The Chief Secretary's absence, as my noble friend has truly said, gave a great shock to public confidence, and an equal shock was given by the attempt to employ the man Larkin as an intermediary between the companies and the men.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01027"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It appears, nevertheless, that a communication did take place. At any rate, the noble Viscount may take it from me that there is a universal impression abroad that there was an attempt to use this man Larkin as a means of bringing about an understanding in spite of the fact that he had been convicted of a serious offence, that he was an open advocate of disloyalty, and an open instigator of murder and outrage. Both these occurrences gave, as I said, a shock to public confidence in Ireland, and the feeling of insecurity was not diminished by the delay which took place in taking measures to protect those who were in danger owing to these occurrences. All that
<col>240</col>
is past and done, but I trust the noble Viscount will permit me to express the hope that His Majesty's Government have learned something from this lesson, and that if the law is, as the noble Viscount told us just now, insufficient for the purpose of dealing with the kind of incitements of which Mr. Larkin has been guilty, if the existing law is not strong enough to prevent the kind of intimidation which, in the guise of peaceful picketing, now takes place whenever these disputes occur, the Government will make it their business, if necessary by means of further inquiry, to ascertain whether the law does not require to be strengthened. If with the somewhat sinister outlook which lies before us at the present time we are to be left with an inadequate law administered by officials who think it consistent with their duty not to be at their posts in times of emergency, I am afraid we may look forward to very troublous times indeed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01028"><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: With your Lordships' permission I should like to add a few words to what has been said. During the course of the strike I was not in the United Kingdom but I very carefully followed the course of the strike in the newspapers, and when I returned I made it my business to make inquiries as to what the true state of things in Dublin was and what was the course of procedure followed by the officials. I could not find, and I think the sources of my information were good, that whenever protection was asked for from Dublin Castle by any interest in Ireland that protection was refused. I made it my business to verify the statement that the Under-Secretary did take the earliest opportunity of assuring the railway companies, especially the Kingsbridge railway authorities, that on application to him he would do all he could to meet their wishes for protection and assistance. I have verified that statement and found it to be correct. Therefore the transactions began with the assurance to the railway companies that, so far as the Government of Ireland could give them protection, that protection would be given. From that time onwards no application, so far as I have learned, was made to Dublin Castle for protection which was not granted so far as the means at the disposal of the Irish Executive permitted.<lb/>
The police at an early stage managed to get complete control of the City of Dublin,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0125"/>
<col>241</col>
but after a time the claims upon their services became so great that an application had to be, made, to the Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabulary for assistance. That assistance was given, so that from the outset the Executive had the situation in Dublin completely at their control. When next difficulties arose throughout the country it became essential to call in the military. The military were not, and I think most wisely, brought into the streets, but the military were stationed, after consultation with the railway companies, at those railway stations and centres of railway activity where their services could be more fully utilised. The police throughout Ireland were employed in guarding the railway lines and protecting bridges and tunnels, and from beginning to end no accident and no loss of property that need be talked of occurred. That, surely, my Lords, is complete proof that from beginning to end of this strike the authorities in Ireland had complete control of the situation.<lb/>
It is said that the Chief Secretary ought to have been there. Well, the Chief Secretary no doubt would have been there if he had not complete confidence in his Under-Secretary, and knowing the Under-Secretary as I do, having served with him for nearly six years, I believe that Mr. Birrell's confidence was absolutely well placed, and that no advantage to the country or to the public interest would have ensued from Mr. Birrell's presence in Ireland, because he could have added nothing to the protection which was given by the Under-Secretary at the time. During the course of this debate it seemed to me that the action of the Irish Government was more or less criticised by reason of the great difficulties and loss inflicted on the Irish people, especially on the poorer classes, during the strike. The Executive Government could by no means that I know of have relieved that tension. It was a question between the employers of labour and their labourers. If the railway servants refused to work, it was not possible for the Government to assist, but so far as the military authorities were able to afford engineers for running trains and so on, they gave them; so that if your Lordships have before you the question of a censure of the Irish Government because of their inaction in regard to this strike, I think a true knowledge of the facts would lead your Lordships to a different conclusion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01029"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with great, attention to this discussion, and. so far as the noble Lord who has just spoken has made a defence of Sir James Dougherty he has my sympathy. The noble Lord said he served with him for six years. I was at Dublin Castle for a longer period with Sir James Dougherty, and he is a friend of mine. But I submit that he was left in a cruel and unfair position. It is not reasonable, the head of his Department for all I know being wilfully absent, to leave any man in charge of great responsibilities which should not be left unaided on his shoulders. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House has made an ingenious speech, and with his great mastery of language has skated round a great many topics. But he hardly applied himself at all to the real gravamen of my noble friend's Motion&#x2014;namely, Why was the Chief Secretary absent? What excuse has the noble Viscount suggested for the absence of the chief Executive officer of the Irish Government at this most critical time? Not a vestige of reason has been given. I observed that the noble Viscount slipped in the word Balmoral, why I do not know. It might convey the notion that the Chief Secretary was at the time in attendance on the King. Is there any truth in that? Was he in attendance at Balmoral at the time? If not, why on the living earth mention Balmoral?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01035"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Viscount suggest that the reason of the Chief's Secretary's absence at this most crucial time in Ireland was owing to his attendance at Balmoral? Why; if he had gone to the Sovereign and said, "Urgent

<col>243</col>
duties call me to Ireland, "the King would have at once said, "Go and attend to your business." It is not suggested that a single bit of public business kept the Chief Secretary away. Every newspaper in Ireland kept asking, "Where is the Chief Secretary? Why does he not come and mind his business? "The Lord-Lieutenant left the north of Scotland and came to Dublin and spent a week there. Why did not the Chief Secretary come? We all know the advantage of the personal attendance and the personal weight of the head of a Department. It would have gone out at once that the Chief Secretary was there, and was going to give his mind and the weight of his authority to the questions involved. He would have been there for the Under-Secretary to consult, not at the end of a telegraph wire, but <i>viv&#x00E2; voce</i> across the table in a room where they could consider and discuss everything at their leisure.<lb/>
The strike is now, happily, over. I do not think it is over through any action on the part of the Government, but through the vigorous resource and courage of the railway authorities. They showed throughout firmness, resolution, and resource. I saw in the Press that Sir William Goulding and the other railway authorities stated that they had pressed for protection. The noble Lord who has just spoken said they always got it. I do not know how that may be. I do not think it was the view of the railway authorities that they got the protection when they asked for it and as quickly as they desired it. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House has referred to the action of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. It must be remembered that the strike was over then, and possibly the members thought they had better not pass ally resolution on the subject. There was nothing said in the resolution about Mr. Birrell; it was the Government that was referred to. But the incident was over then, and they were probably not anxious to exasperate the position by putting such a resolution on record. The statement by Sir Horace Plunkett which the noble Viscount read is what might have been expected from him. I should think he is as hard a man to get to fight as any man I have the pleasure of knowing.<lb/>
<col>244</col>
The noble Viscount the Leader of the House said it was a familiar incident in a Chief Secretary's career to be absent when his duties required him to be in Ireland, and I think the noble Lord who spoke last conveyed the impression that the less Mr. Birrell is in Ireland the better. But I think if these incidents had occurred when my noble friend behind me (Lord St. Aldwyn) was Chief Secretary, or when the noble Viscount opposite (Lord Morley) was Chief Secretary, they would have been in Ireland twenty-four hours after the strike had commenced. I dare say Mr. Birrell is now rather sorry that he did not go. I believe he said recently that he was over in Ireland for two days at the end of the strike. Well, we thank him for nothing. Probably other duties brought hint over. Probably my noble friend will not think it necessary to press this Motion to a Division. But I am rather disposed to think that no answer has been given to his charge, and that it would have been better and wiser and more in accordance with his duty if the Chief Secretary had been present in Ireland during this critical period.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01036"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not consider the answer which the noble Viscount the Leader of the House has made as at all satisfactory. He challenged me on one point, and I answered him. I also gave chapter and verse with regard to the wish expressed by the Lord-Lieutenant that the leading timber merchant to whom I referred should meet this man Larkin. The noble Viscount said that Mr. Birrell was at the end of a telegraph wire. Well, I suppose that for the future we must be content with a Chief Secretary who is at the end of a telegraph wire. On the question of dates, I would point out that the strike broke out on the 16th, and Mr. Birrell left Balmoral on the 10th&#x2014;six days before the strike commenced. In view of what has been said and the appeal made by my noble and learned friend who has just spoken, I beg to withdraw the Motion, though I am by no means satisfied with the explanation which has been given.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01072">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in putting this somewhat, I fear, rather long list of Questions to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, I have no desire to occupy your Lordships' time with any lengthy speech, but I should like, by way of preface, to remind your Lordships that since its inception the responsibility of the Territorial Force has been considerably increased&#x2014;that is to say, judging from the statements of official and responsible people, it is asked to perform duties far exceeding those which were originally demanded of it. I feel I must again remind your Lordships of the last authoritative statement that we had from the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Prime Minister, as the Chairman and speaking on behalf of that Committee, made this statement in the House of Commons&#x2014;
<quote>"With regard to the military aspect it is, in consequence of the finding of this Committee, the business of the War Office to see that we have under all circumstances a properly organised and properly equipped Force capable of dealing effectively with a possible invasion of 70,000 men."</quote>
If language means anything at all, "under all circumstances" means when the Expeditionary Force or the Striking Force is out of the country, and "under all circumstances" must also cover the case of the Fleet being away. That is a very strong statement by the Prime Minister, and especially strong as it is the statement of the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Since that pronouncement in the House of Commons we have had no words, official or non-official, issuing from that Committee altering, weakening, or changing that statement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01073">Since then the Secretary of State for War, speaking at Tranent in September of this year, made a statement which I maintain is entirely contrary to the view
<col>248</col>
expressed by the Prime Minister. The noble Viscount said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Navy did its duty it was not probable that any considerable body of aggressors would get here."</quote>
The object of my Questions is to obtain information, so that we may be able to form some sober estimate of the facts and the condition of the Territorial Army. If in the view of the Secretary of State it is not probable that any considerable body of aggressors could get here, the original statement of the Prime Minister that we have to provide against an invasion of 70,000 men is not accurate; on the other hand, if we are again to relapse into the "Blue-water School" view, I think it might be asked under these circumstances, if an invasion is not practicable, how many men will be required. And if it is not probable that we shall have to encounter an invasion, why then should we talk of even the considerable number of men composing the Territorial Force of a strength of 260,000?</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01074">Around this question of the Territorial Force really hangs, if I may say so, a great deal of the value and efficacy of our whole original military scheme. We were to have&#x2014;and that was a prominent feature as regards the Regular Army&#x2014;a Striking Force of 166,000 men with six Divisions. Let us make a supposition. I confess I am I not inclined to think it is a reasonable supposition. But supposing we could send 166,000 men abroad in our Striking Force. We have to ask ourselves what would I remain behind to defend these shores. When this question was brought forward by me in July, 1910, Lord Crewe, speaking in reply to many noble Lords on this side of the House, made use of this very remarkable statement. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I cannot foresee a state of things which would make it imperative to send the whole of the six Divisions out of the country at one moment."</quote>
Had the noble Marquess been able to be in his place this evening, I should have liked to ask him whether in July and August of this year he still held the view that a state of things did not exist in which it might be imperative, in order to maintain the balance of power in Europe and to assert the rights of this country, that we should be able to land on the Continent a Striking Force and to send that Striking Force out of the country at once. In fact, my Lords, if the Striking Force cannot be sent out at once, but only in driblets, it
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0129"/>
<col>249</col>
seems to me a farce and misleading to the public to speak of its being a striking force at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01075">Then there is another point of view as regards the purport of these Questions. I do not myself believe that with a country like this, governed and controlled as we are by public opinion and to a great extent in times of crisis by public excitement&#x2014;I do not believe that the country would allow the whole of the Striking Force to leave these shores and leave the country utterly denuded of all Regular troops. There is one other point. The Secretary of State for War said at Tranent that he would use the Territorial Force for what it is worth the first day of war. Now that is a strong and a bold statement, and my Questions are put to attempt, if that is so, to elicit the worth of the Territorial Force on the first day of war in strength, in efficiency, and in mobility.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01076">I propose, with your Lordships' kind indulgence, to go through the list of Questions which stand in my name on the Paper. In my first Question I ask the noble Viscount what was the strength of the Territorial Force on October 1, 1911. In the second Question I ask for the number of officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Territorial Force who were absent from camp training in 1911, Permanent Staff excluded. As regards the number of officers, non-commissioned officers and men who attended camp training for one week only during 1911, I am informed that figures were given to Colonel Sandys&#x2014;no doubt the noble Viscount will confirm this when he replies&#x2014;showing that the number was, in round figures, 76,500. As regards the number who attended for two weeks the figure was given at 155,000. Now I come to a very remarkable and, I must confess, a most unsatisfactory condition of things. In reply to Question (<i>c</i>)&#x2014;the number who did not attend camp training at all&#x2014;it was stated in reply to Colonel Sandys that this number amounted to 33,500. That represents twelve per cent. of the whole Force, and in that connection I cannot help remembering what the noble Viscount himself said on March 4, 1907. Speaking of the Bill which was then before the House of Commons, the Secretary of State said he hoped the men would fake a good long camp in the autumn. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"In a mild way we have made camp compulsory. That seems a drastic thing to do, but it is absolutely essential."</quote>
<col>250</col>
I am sure that is good sense and perfectly true. The maximum of training under the Territorial conditions is not a burdensome or a great one, and to say that there shall be no camp training at all, as is practically the case with these 33,500 men, reduces their service to a farce.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01077">I now come to Question 3. My object in asking for the number of men whose engagements expired on September 30 last and who re-engaged for further service in the Territorial Force is this. If these men re-engaged in such very large numbers, I cannot understand what happens, say, to the Territorial Reserve. With regard to Question 4, I have been able to extract some rather remarkable figures from the Annual Army Report I find that for the half year 1908 the number of Territorial recruits was 39,000. Then came the boom in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, which did great service, and in the year 1909 the number of recruits sprang up to 110,000; but for the year 1910, which are the last figures that I have, the number of Territorial recruits dropped again to 42,000, which is very little more than for the half year in 1908. Then I come to Question 5&#x2014;the number of non-commissioned officers and men whose ages are under nineteen. It will be very interesting to hear what the Secretary of State has to say upon that. In Question 6 I ask how many men fired the standard test on an open range during the last musketry year, and, of those, how many qualified and how many failed to qualify. I have not got very much to say as regards that, except that I should like to call your Lordships' attention to the fact that the standard test is not at all a high one. The distance is 100 yards, the number of rounds 23, the maximum of points 97, and the qualification is only 30 points.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01078">Now I come to Question 7, in regard to the Imperial Yeomanry. I ask how many horses are shown in the latest Yeomanry training returns under the heading "Own" or "Relatives." The object of that Question is to ascertain in the case of mobilisation how many horses would be available. In Question 8 I ask whether the Territorial Horse and Field Artillery batteries are marked for "fire tactics" at annual practice. I see so many military experts here that I feel it to be presumptuous in me to mention anything on this subject, but there may be other of your
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0130"/>
<col>251</col>
Lordships who are not experts on this subject, and perhaps I may remind them of the fact that the Artillery practice is divided into three classes&#x2014;first, fire tactics, which, speaking concisely, means the selection of the position and getting the guns into the position; secondly, fire discipline, which implies the handling of the battery after the guns are in position; and, thirdly, fire effect, which means the effect on the target. In all these three points a Regular battery has to be efficient. I want to know how this relatively applies to the Territorial Horse and Field Artillery batteries. As regards the second part of Question 8&#x2014;how many of these batteries carried out annual practice in 1911&#x2014;I am assured by all those who have personal experience in this matter that annual practice is most essential, in fact, is absolutely essential for any kind of efficiency at all. I do not think Question 9 is quite as clear as it should be. What it means is, What is the number of these batteries which earned out annual practice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01079">As to Questions 10 and 11, the Secretary of State told us at Birmingham that the cost of the Volunteer was &#x00A3;7 and the cost of the Territorial &#x00A3;11. That is a very interesting and significant fact, and I cannot help in regard to that calling your Lordships' attention to the number of men who did not attend camp at all. Taking the cost of the Territorial at &#x00A3;11, I arrive at this fact, that the cost of the 33,500 men who never attended camp amounted to &#x00A3;368,000, and it seems to me that a great part, if not the whole, of that money was completely wasted. I have nothing to say upon Question 12, and as regards Question 13 I want to be assured that there are no officers on the return of the Territorial Force who are not resident in the United Kingdom. For that purpose I ask how many officers there are on the returns of the Territorial Force who are not resident in the United Kingdom. I beg to put the Questions standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01080"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl touched, among other things, upon events which he thinks happened recently, and on those he will not expect me to speak. If he has any Questions upon them, they should be addressed to the head of the Government. But he touched also on a number of
<col>252</col>
questions relating to the Territorial Force on which it is my duty to give him as full information as I can. He spoke of the responsibility of the Territorial Force and of that responsibility as an increased responsibility. I do not think it is an increased responsibility. It is the same responsibility as existed when he so ably carried out the duties of Under-Secretary of State for War in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Government and dealt with the scheme. I can tell him broadly nothing new but what has already been stated publicly. I will sum up, and put into form the functions which the Territorial Force is designed to fulfil. Here they are, and I will state them in words which represent the advice furnished to me by the body on which I always rely for shaping policy&#x2014;the General Staff.<lb/>
I am advised by the General Staff that from their point of view the important thing is the organisation in suitable units of a Force sufficient to provide for three things, and I ask the noble Earl's attention to this, because on the accurate comprehension of it depends the answer to a good deal of what he said. The first of these three things is coast defence; the second is defence against raids on a comparatively small scale&#x2014;that is to say, raids by a small force of 2,000 or so which may slip past the Fleet; and the third is the formation of a Central Force capable of reinforcing the local forces required for defence against these raids, and also capable of dealing with attack on a larger scale. The maximum strength of an attacking force of this nature has, for purposes of calculation and comparison&#x2014;we wish to be on the safe side&#x2014;been assumed to be 70,000 men. That is the standard up to which we wish to prepare. But I may observe that, according to the considered views of the Admiralty, which were expressed and published last January, no force of anything approaching that strength could possibly land on these shores. That is the considered Admiralty view.<lb/>
Dealing first with coast defence, for which we make provision, we rely, to begin with, on the Regular Royal Garrison Artillery and Royal Engineers, who are required to man fixed defences. Next we rely on the Special and Extra Reserve battalions, which, when they have absorbed the unfit left behind by Line battalions and the surplus Regular Reservists, will
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0131"/>
<col>253</col>
amount to 100,000 in all ranks. These Special Reserve battalions are small in time of peace, but the Extra Reservists and the other additions swell up these third battalions in many cases to 1,100and 1,200. We also rely for coast defence on certain technical units of the Territorial Force raised locally in defended ports and trained there. The Army Troops battalions and a few batteries from certain Divisions of the Territorial Force are also allotted to garrison duties.<lb/>
Now I come to the second heading&#x2014;defence against raids on a comparatively small scale; and this implies that we should have troops along the coast for the purpose, of repelling these raids and being in superior force when they come, and, above all, being able to hold them until the Central Force can come up. For that purpose we have assigned eleven Mounted Brigades and ten Divisions of the Territorial Force. As regards the third heading&#x2014;the formation of a Central Force&#x2014;three Mounted Brigades and four Divisions of the Territorial Force are originally allotted, and in the event of serious attack this Force would be augmented by Mounted Brigades and Divisions forming part of the local forces as soon as the main point of attack had been determined. Arrangements are also made to include in the Central Force two Divisions of the Regular Army if, when the necessity for taking expeditionary action arises, the Territorial Force is not considered capable of undertaking the duties of home defence without the aid of Regular troops. I do not think it is desirable to go further into the details of organisation for home defence.<lb/>
As regards the case which the noble Earl put of the Expeditionary Force being abroad, it is the business of those who are responsible for forming a judgment on that matter to consider the whole of the circumstances of each case, and in shaping their campaign to see how they stand. I would remind the noble Earl that if the Expeditionary Force was going away for a long time or distance, the Territorial Force would be adequately trained, because the Territorial Force must be embodied on the very day on which the Expeditionary Force is embodied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01081"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: How about Belgium?&#x2014;I mean if they had to go to Belgium.</membercontribution></p>
<col>254</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01082"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Assuming such a hypothetical case, it is the business of those who are responsible for the strategy of this country to see that proper dispositions are made, either that the whole of the Expeditionary Force does not leave or that the coast is so protected by the Fleet that the Expeditionary Force may safely leave. The view expressed in the Admiralty Memorandum points to the second alternative. But I do not think it either desirable or possible to lay these things down ahead. They are matters of military and naval strategy which must be decided in reference to the circumstances of the case arising. It is the duty of the General Staff, and it is what the General Staff exists for, to advise when certain steps can be safely taken and to advise when those steps cannot be taken. They may think it desirable to keep two Divisions at home, or they may not. Finally, it is considered that in certain contingencies the forces which would be now available for home defence in the absence of the Expeditionary Force are sufficient for the duties which they would be called upon to perform, although I entirely agree with the noble Earl that it would be more satisfactory if the Territorial Force was recruited to full establishment in peace. It may, however, be assumed that the ranks would rapidly be filled on a crisis arising. Moreover, we have now over 50,000 veterans on the list, of whom it is probable that we could count upon at any rate 15,000 or 20,000 active men to reinforce the Territorial Force, and these are men who would have valuable influence from the i fact that they are highly trained.<lb/>
These forces, taken together, amount to the following total. If the Expeditionary Force is at home you have, of course, an enormous Army of nearly 600,000; but if the Expeditionary Force is away, if the whole of the six Divisions are away, you still have 100,000 in the Special Reserve battalions, and, taking the figures to-day of the Territorial Force, over 260,000 Territorials and probably from 15,000 to 20,000 National Reservists ready and willing to take their part; and with a considerable number of Regulars, including Garrison Artillery Engineers and the fighting units left over after the requirements of the Expeditionary? Force on mobilisation have been satisfied, there would be upwards of 400,000 troops at home. The standard which we have set ourselves to compare against is a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0132"/>
<col>255</col>
possible invasion of 70,000. If the number is above 70,000, our superior Fleet would have a target which they would at once pierce and destroy, and if anything like 70,000 men came over the view of the Admiralty is that they would be in a similar position.<lb/>
Look how we stand as regards 70,000 men. If 70,000 men were to come over they would be in this unhappy position, that with our superior Navy their lines of communication would be in danger. I do not know how many of your Lordships have studied these matters, but I. need hardly remind you that the last thing an enemy is likely to risk is the sending of any considerable body of troops with their lines of communication liable to be broken at any moment. That means they may do a certain amount of mischief, but they lose the great body of their troops. With 400,000 troops at home, organised in proper units, with an admixture of Regulars and Special Reservists, with Regular Garrison Artillery in the fixed positions, and with the formations which exist now, all I can say is that I think the last thing that is likely is that any enemy would risk the certain destruction of his Army of 70,000&#x2014;that is, assuming he could get it here.<lb/>
The great difference between the two views that obtain on this subject is this. The first lays stress on the deficiencies which exist to-day in the numbers of the Territorial Force, and treats the Territorial Force, organised in fourteen Divisions and fourteen mounted brigades, with their etceteras, as a huge Army which is to be marched to the field of action. If it were to be so, with their want of training, and to some extent affected by deficiency of numbers, the Territorial Force would be a most unwieldy body. But as I have explained, the Territorial Force is rather to be looked upon as a large reservoir, not of men, but of organised units, with auxiliary services, with their transport and everything as complete as we can make it, out of which is formed the Central Force, the real Striking Force, the Force which is there to swoop down on an invading force. In front of that, is the line of Territorial troops along the coast in the I various commands, and then the troops defending important positions, consisting of 100,000 Special Reservists, well-trained men containing among them a large pro-
<col>256</col>
portion of Regular Reservists highly trained. That is the system, and the Central Force, which is organised partly of Territorial units and partly out o Regular units, is so designed as to make it as rapidly mobile as possible. The organisation of this Force has been a matter of the closest, attention for several years past, and I now believe it to exist in a condition of considerable efficiency.<lb/>
It is quite true that the Territorial Force is unfortunately short of a good many men. It is five-sixths of its establishment. That is considerable; but still it is between 40,000 and 50,000 men short, I wish that it were fuller. It ought to be fuller. It could be fuller. I know districts in London where people are keen about the Territorial Force, where they work, and where the Territorial units are in consequence up to establishment and in an efficient condition. I know other districts of the country where nobody takes any great interest in the Territorial Force, and where as a result things are slack. I know Territorial commanders who have put their backs into the matter, and not only have their full number of men, but have waiting lists. But there are other commanding officers&#x2014;and, unfortunately, in this great city of London there are some&#x2014;who take the view that they have only to lie on their backs and the apples will somehow fall into their mouths. But people must work. The great bulk of the commanding officers of the Territorial Force and their stairs do work, otherwise we should not have got five-sixths of the establishment as we have at present. But, as I say, there are others who take a more easy-going view of their duty. I hope those will be stiffened up before long, and that people will recognize that the Territorial Army can only be kept alive by patriotism and the energy which patriotism inspires.<lb/>
Then there are a number of people&#x2014;some of your Lordships, I think, among them&#x2014;who say, "Oh, it is ridiculous to try and organise a Territorial Force on a voluntary basis; what we want is compulsory service." Assuming that you do want compulsory service, how soon are you likely to get it I Are you agreed upon it? Is any large party in the country likely to influence an election on your Side? And if you have to wait years before you convert people to your views, what are you to do in the meantime?
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0133"/>
<col>257</col>
One would have thought that these considerations would have led those who favour compulsory service to say, "Any-how, in the meantime let us do all we can to recruit the Territorial Force up to its strength." But there are many who take a different view, and who go about advising people not to enlist in the Territorial Force. I have no doubt that the, as I think, misplaced services of these men have cost the Territorial Force between 20,000 and 30,000 men by this discouragement. There can be no doubt about the effect which the energies of the National Service League have had upon recruiting&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01083"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: The National Service League has brought in a great many recruits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01084"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has been an honourable exception to the general rule of the members of the National Service League. There are a good many people who have worked hard, but there are a large number who have taken an exactly opposite course, and have gone about preaching, "Do not join the Territorial Force. Let us get rid of this sham, and then let us get compulsory service." I think I heard the noble Lord opposite once say that the coming into existence of compulsory service would not be a thing of to-day or the day after. If people hold those sound views, then I should have thought the sensible course was to throw themselves with energy into stirring up the national spirit in favour of enlistment in the Territorial Force. Be that as it may, the Territorial Force stands to-day in this position. This year we had some 45,000 men who were due to go out. Over 25,000 of them re-engaged, and the, shortage was more than made up by new recruits. There were others who went to the Regulars and some who emigrated. Good trade always has an adverse effect, and the Territorial Force has suffered through the prosperity of these times. But you have, as I say, five-sixths of the Territorial Force, enough to give you the organisation which the General Staff desires, enough to provide the Central Force and to provide the coast defence force. I am far from saying that I do not want to get the rest. I should be thankful if I could get them, but there is no reason to sit down and despair at this moment about the Territorial Force. If people will only throw their energy into it in the way that is being
<col>258</col>
done in many parts of the country, the Territorial Force would be very quickly up to establishment.<lb/>
I will now turn to the specific Questions raised by the noble Earl. In Question I the noble Earl asks what was the strength of the Force on October 1, 1911. The strength of the Force on that date was 9,475 officers and 254,692 non-commissioned officers and men, and in addition there were 724 Royal Army Medical Corps officers of general hospitals and sanitary service available only on mobilisation, and 976 officers of the Officers Training Corps and Unattached List&#x2014;a total of well over 265,000. The reply to Question 2 is that the numbers present in camp for fifteen days and over were&#x2014;Officers, 6,975; noncommissioned officers and men, 148,318. Those who attended for eight days and less than fifteen were&#x2014;Officers, 1,011; non-commissioned officers and men, 75,523; and those who attended in camp for less than eight days were 63 officers and 330 non-commissioned officers and men. The totals are&#x2014;Officers, 8,049; non-commissioned officers and men, 224,171. The numbers absent with leave were&#x2014;Officers, 1,450; non-commissioned officers and men 25,317. The numbers absent without leave were&#x2014;Officers, 41; non-commissioned officers and men, 6,703. Totals&#x2014;Officers, 1,491; non-commissioned officers and men, 32,020. The noble Earl said that taking the cost of the Teiritorial at &#x00A3;11, the men who never attended camp must have cost &#x00A3;368,000; but I would point out that, being absent from camp, they were not paid.<lb/>
The answer to Question 3 is that out of the 45,957 whose engagements were due to expire between October 1, 1910, and October 1, 1911, about 27,000 have reengaged for the following periods&#x2014;for one year, 23,427; for two years, 2,004; for three years, 492; for four years, 1,036; total, 26,959. The numbers actually discharged on termination of engagement were 34&#x00B7;7 per cent. of those due to go, as against 35&#x00B7;8 per cent. last year. I now come to Question 4. The number of recruits taken was as follows: For the year ended September 30, 1909, 110,020; men enlisted with previous service, 10,573. For the year ended September 30, 1910, recruits 42,239; men enlisted with previous service, 3,391. For the year ended September 30, 1911, 39,086; men enlisted
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0134"/>
<col>259</col>
with previous service, 2,203. In Question 5 the noble Earl asks what is the number of non-commissioned officers and men whose ages are under nineteen. The number on October 1, 1911, was 32,494 out of 254,602&#x2014;that is to say, 12&#x00B7;70 per cent. With reference to Question 6, the standard test can only be fired on an open range. The figures for 1910&#x2013;11 will not be available till the end of the year, but the following are the figures for the musketry year 1909&#x2013;10: Recruits, 66,624 tested&#x2014;36,089 qualified, 30,535 failed. Trained men, 113,096 tested&#x2014;90,672 qualified, 22,424 failed. These figures have been affected by the shortage of ranges, but we are acquiring ranges as rapidly as we can. I wish golf links did not sweep so many of them away, but we have acquired or reconstructed about 100 new ranges, including 51 miniature ranges, since the beginning of the year.<lb/>
I now come to the noble Earl's Question regarding the Imperial Yeomanry. In answer to Question 7 I may say that the number of horses at this year's camp was 20,660, made up as follows: Property of officers, non-commissioned officers and men, 7,778; hired, 12,868; Government, 9; property of Association, 5. This is the only information we have as to horses. Following upon the new powers which were given in the Army Annual Act of last April the horse organisation has been altogether recast. Under that Act the Associations now have powers to take horses compulsorily, and for that purpose an accurate census of horses was required. We began by taking before the Act passed a police census, which was valuable as giving us some indication of the number of horses in the country. I estimated that there were upwards of a million and a-half useful horses at the disposition of the Associations, and they are classifying them all over the country. Additional remount officers have been appointed for the purpose, as well as veterinary officers, and the adjutants and non-commissioned officers allotted to them are making a complete classification and census of the horses in the country. The Yeomanry will have their own horses assigned to them, and the Regulars will have their own horses assigned to them. The horses are classified&#x2014;those fit for Cavalry and Artillery and so on&#x2014;and the census is proceeding rapidly. It has already given us sufficient result to enable us to mobilise the Expeditionary
<col>260</col>
Force with the requisite horses, and I see no reason to doubt that it will provide adequately for the Yeomanry. The Yeomanry are naturally interested in looking after their own horses. In addition to that, we are encouraging and advancing funds for the Associations to purchase horses.<lb/>
I now come to Question 8. The answer to the first part of the question is, No. If the noble Earl will refer to the Instructions for Practice of Artillery, he will see I that Section 17 provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"Brigades and batteries of Territorial Force Artillery will not be classified, but officers commanding Divisional Territorial Force Artillery are at liberty to issue locally an order of merit. The order of merit should be based on the instructions issued for the classification of batteries."</quote>
In 1911, 127 Territorial Horse and Field Artillery batteries carried out practice. Biennial practice can only be carried out at regular practice camps, but commanders-in-chief can authorise practice annually where other ranges are available which are primarily used for Regular troops. We have been hampered hitherto by want of Artillery ranges, but this year we have acquired two new ones, one at Salisbury Plain, and the other in Northumberland, which ought to prove very useful.<lb/>
In answer to Question 9, the percentage is 76&#x00B7;8. In Question 10 the noble Earl asks what was the total cost of the Yeomanry and Volunteers for the year ended March 31, 1906. The Imperial Yeomanry cost &#x00A3;527,250, effective; &#x00A3;19,550, non-effective; (total, &#x00A3;546,800. The Volunteers cost &#x00A3;1,528,400, effective; &#x00A3;140,540, non-effective; total, &#x00A3;1,668,940. That is to say, the total cost, effective and non-effective, of the Imperial Yeomanry and Volunteers was &#x00A3;2,215,740. The Territorial Force cost &#x00A3;3,017,855, effective; &#x00A3;147,760, non-effective; total, &#x00A3;3,165,615.<lb/>
As to Question 12, looking through the <i>Gazettes</i> for the twelve months ended September, 1911, the number of Territorial Force officers who resigned during that period was 916; the number of new officers of the Territorial Force&#x2014;that is, on first appointment&#x2014;during the same period was 875. Both these figures are exclusive of officers of the Unattached List and of the Officers Training Corps. The answer to the thirteenth and final Question is that officers of the Territorial Force must have their permanent residence in the United Kingdom under the Territorial
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0135"/>
<col>261</col>
Force Regulations. We have no figures showing how many officers have been given leave to travel abroad or in the Colonies. I may mention in this connection that the Territorial Force has the following Regular officers, in addition to those of whom I have spoken. There are fourteen Divisions of the Territorial Force and there are fourteen Major-Generals who are commanders of Divisions, each of whom has a General Staff officer. Those, of course, are all Regulars. In addition, there are thirty-one Regular Brigade commanders, and there are some ex Regular commanders still commanding Brigades, but the policy is to substitute active Regular officers on half-pay for the retired officers who were in during the earlier stages of the Force, so that the Brigade commands may as nearly as possible be filled by Regular officers, who would know that their promotion depended on the success they made in handling their Brigades. Nine exceptionally capable Territorial officers have been promoted to command Brigades. There are 406 Regular adjutants and 4 ex-Regular adjutants. These represent the Regular element which is attached to the command of the Territorial Force. I think I have now answered all the Questions which have been put to me, but if there is any further information which any of your Lordships desire, of course you have only to address a Question to me on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01085"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl made the object of his Questions very plain in his opening statement, but I think there is some little embarrassment in mixing up a question which is so largely one of Territorial Force statistics with the more general considerations with which the noble Earl prefaced his Questions. We who sit here and who heard the noble Earl when he was seated on the Front Government Bench as Under-Secretary for War fully appreciate the interest which he takes in the Territorial Force; but I must admit that his view was then rather different from what it is now. He used to speak in the accents of a fond and indulgent parent. He now always seems to me to speak as if he were afraid that an affiliation order was going to be made on him with regard to an offspring which he desires to discard. The difference is certainly very marked, and I notice that the noble Earl feels so much the change that he does not even designate the noble
<col>262</col>
Viscount by that more affectionate appellation which usually obtains between colleagues.<lb/>
We are, I think, in some little difficulty this evening if we pass by the first part of the noble Earl's speech in order to address ourselves simply to the statistics which we have heard, because the noble Viscount opposite also speaks in two voices. When the noble Viscount first introduced this scheme we were given to understand that the numbers upon which he relied for the Territorial Force were really the minimum, not the maximum. I do not propose to follow those who speak of the Territorial Army as if it were a failure. Not for a moment do those of us who were concerned with the Volunteers, as they were before, feel that anything but good has been done by the efforts of the noble Viscount and of the General Staff as regards the organisation, the equipment, and the training of the Territorial Force. And I think we should do ourselves great injustice if we appeared in this House to show ourselves wanting in appreciation of the spirit which the Force has shown, and the efforts which the Force generally has made to come up to the demands of the military authorities. But when we have said that we have not said all.<lb/>
I am afraid I must press upon the noble Viscount again, without wishing to go into the broad question, which will be rediscussed, no doubt, in this House on some Motion before we leave the whole composition of the Territorial Force, that we are still in ignorance of some most material facts which really will settle the competence of the Force for the business on which it is to be engaged. The noble Viscount two or three times to-night alluded, in that rotund manner in which he treats all big figures, to 100,000 Special Reservists and remnants of the Army who will be here after the Expeditionary Force has left these shores. I have said, on behalf of noble Lords on this side and with the authority and support on one occasion of Lord Roberts and on the other of Lord Grenfell, who is present to-night, that the quotation of that figure is really valueless to us unless it is accompanied by a clear military opinion of the value of those 100,000 men, disjointed as they are to some extent and consisting to a large extent of battalions from whom the best men have been already taken.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0136"/>
<col>263</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01086"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I gave that figure on the authority of the General Staff. I should not have said it if the whole scheme had not been prepared by the General Staff, and the Adjutant General had not assured me that the numbers would be there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01087"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: A second point which is left in doubt is this. I listened with a little impatience to the noble Viscount's reiteration of the old argument that while the Expeditionary Force would be going abroad the Territorial Force would be under training. There are a number of cases in which that would not take place. If there was trouble in India, a large number of troops would be sent, and then more would be sent; and it would be at a late stage in the operations that any Secretary of State for War would feel himself justified in dislocating the trade of the country by calling out the Territorial Force. Yet unless you call them out you cannot train them, and unless you train them I do not think there is any military authority in the country who would like to pit them against Continental troops.<lb/>
There is another consideration. We quite agree with the noble Viscount that there is no occasion to despair. But the fact remains that he asked for 315,000 men and has only got 260,000, and of those 260,000 a certain number have not been able to come up to the training that he desires. I think that some day these points must be reckoned up, not from the parental standard nor upon the critical standard of the past parent, but as a national subject. We must consider how the ranks of the Territorial Army can be filled up if we are to continue our voluntary system. I have before from this place pressed on the noble Viscount what I believe is the only possible solution. It is that he should adopt a National Reserve; that he should take all men in the National Reserve who in military opinion are fit for service, men under forty or not much above forty; that he should organise them in companies in each county, and that those companies should be attached on mobilisation to the Territorial Force, eliminating from that Force, at all events for the first six months, all those men who had not got a year's service and who had not shot their classes.<lb/>
I know, of course, that you may say that more may yet be done in the way of
<col>264</col>
recruiting. The noble Viscount complained of persons who went about the country and decried recruiting for one reason or another. The greatest elements in the matter of recruiting are not individuals, however distinguished or however biassed in favour of national service; they are members of the whole Government themselves and the whole policy of the Government. You have spent, according to the figures which the noble Viscount gave us, &#x00A3;1,500,000 extra annually trying to induce good citizens up to the number of 315,000 to give up their leisure and ease in order to serve the country in the Territorial Force. But you have spent thirty millions on the Estimates in the last five years in inducing people not to consider what they can do for the State, but in teaching them that the business of the State is to look after them. So long as you preach the doctrine that it is for every man to consider how much he can get out of the State, you certainly will not induce people to come forward in as large numbers as you desire and give gratuitous service to the State under conditions that have ruled hitherto.<lb/>
I feel great difficulty in urging the noble Viscount to spend more money on the Territorial Force. I know that there are those who think that another &#x00A3;300,000 will arrest the depletion which almost inevitably must occur this year and next year. If that be so, it may be wise to make the expenditure; but if that expenditure is coming off the Expeditionary Force and the Regular Army, then I think we ought to look afresh at the whole of our military expenditure. As regards the figures which the noble Viscount has given, I do not know that any of them are very new to us. I do not think they are discouraging from the standpoint of those who believe that you can go a certain distance, but you never will be able to go the whole distance, in the direction the noble Viscount desires. For my own part I hope that in the course of next year, when we see how far the rather gloomy I anticipations of recruiting are realised, we i shall be allowed to take stock of the whole position without being told that we are actuated by any desire to make political capital out of the possible failure of the Territorial Force to come up to the expectations of the Government. I trust we shall recognise that, with the advance of foreign affairs and with the great changes
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0137"/>
<col>265</col>
in naval armaments, it is imperative for this country to have a Force up to the full numbers which the General Staff desire on which to rely in case of invasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01088"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not intend to take any part in this debate, but the noble Viscount opposite made an unprovoked attack on a body of which I am a member, and I feel some resentment at the charges winch he has brought against us in this connection. From the long statement to which we have listened from the noble Viscount I grasp two, and two only, important facts. One is that the Territorial Force continues to decrease in numbers, and the other is that it continues to increase in expense. In charging other persons with being responsible for this state of things the noble Viscount shows himself the most ungrateful of men. Nobody has ever succeeded in obtaining from his political opponents such support as the noble Viscount has obtained for this particular scheme. I do not think he ever had more enthusiastic supporters of it than the noble Lords who sit upon the Front Opposition Bench in this House. The persons who have done more for it than anybody else are those who belong to the opposite side of politics, and the only opposition that his scheme has encountered has been from the Party to which the noble Viscount himself belongs, and principally from the Labour Party, by whose votes the noble Viscount is kept in office. Therefore maintain that not only is he a singularly ungrateful politician, but he has no right to bring charges of the kind against any body of persons whatsoever. I do not believe, with the exception of the members of the Labour Party, that anybody has ever said a single word to dissuade persons from enlisting in the Territorial Force. The noble Viscount knows perfectly well that the reason why the Force is in an unsatisfactory condition is that the obsolete voluntary system is no longer able to meet our requirements. And what, apparently, we are destined to discuss session after session and year after year is the continual diminution in numbers and the continual increase in expenditure of the Force, because no responsible member of the Government has the courage to come forward and tell the country the plain truth, the plain truth being, as the noble Viscount knows as well as everybody else, that the voluntary system is played out and that under it
<col>266</col>
there is no probability whatever, so far as any reasonable person can see, of his ever obtaining the numbers for which he originally asked.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01089"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are some points arising out of the questions and answers which we have just heard to which I should like to draw your Lordships' attention. One remarkable fact is that the numbers of the Territorial Force seem subject to great variation. In September the Secretary of State for War, speaking in Scotland, is, reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"On the 1st of July last the strength of the Territorial Army was 270,000 officers and men."</quote>
But on the day of speaking&#x2014;which was the 27th of September&#x2014;the noble Viscount mentioned the Force as then numbering 273,000 officers and men, an apparent increase in three months of 3,000. But three days later, on October 1, the strength was 264,167; that is a. decrease in three days of 8,833. We have no information later than the 1st of October. I trust that the rapid decline which set in during the last three days of September has ceased.<lb/>
In the same speech the noble Viscount referred to the points mentioned in the third and fourth Questions asked by the noble Earl&#x2014;namely, recruiting and re-engagement. The noble Viscount is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"There were 35,000 recruits, and 25,000 had re-engaged, making 60,000 men who had come in this year."</quote>
But I demur to the statement that 60,000 men had come in this year, because of that number the 25,000 men who had re-engaged had never really gone out of the Force. They are the same men remaining on in the Force for one, year only, and they are not new recruits. It is just the same as saying that if you took 9 gallons out of an 18-gallon cask, leaving 9 gallons at the bottom, and then were to add another 9 gallons, that you had taken in 18 gallons when of course you had only taken in 9. So the noble Viscount has not taken in 60,000 recruits&#x2014;he has taken in 35,000 recruits, and 25,000 men never went out of the Force but remain in for one extra year.<lb/>
The second Question of the noble Earl's upon the Paper deals with the efficiency of the Territorial Force. The efficiency of any Force as an instrument of war depends both upon numbers and upon training. For instance, on the point of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0138"/>
<col>267</col>
numbers, take a battalion 400 strong; no matter how well trained those 400 men are, they cannot possibly perform battalion duties which require 800 men to adequately carry them out. The battalion would be inefficient on the score of numbers. As each unit in a Division is inefficient on the score of numbers, so the whole Division would be inefficient, and for the same reason the whole Army. We see from the Return that the Territorial Force is numerically a decreasing Force, and consequently annually less efficient in point of numbers. On the point of efficiency in training it appears that 33,511 officers and men did not attend camp this year. That is an increase of 7,516 absentees in comparison with the year before. Moreover, of those who did attend camp, 12,882 fewer attended for the full period of training. We arrive, therefore, at the fact that as the Territorial Force decreases in numbers, so the number of untrained men in the ranks increases, and the number of men attending camp for less than the full period increases. The Under-Secretary of State for War is reported to have said, in a speech made at a distribution of prizes to the London Rifle Brigade last week, that&#x2014;
<quote>"He hoped to lay before Parliament a Report by Sir John French on the efficiency of the Territorial Force."</quote>
Until that Report appears, dealing, as it must deal, with the facts and figures I have just mentioned, I shall make no further comment on the efficiency of the Territorial Army.<lb/>
Questions 10 and 11 of the noble Earl make a comparison between the cost of the Yeomanry and Volunteers in 1906 and the cost of the Territorial Force in 1911. The noble Viscount, speaking at Birmingham on October 24, is reported to have said that&#x2014;
<quote>"He was a believer in spending money on raising the quality of the Force. They had gone up in the last four years from &#x00A3;7 spent on the Volunteer to &#x00A3;11 on the Territorial."</quote>
But as the total cost must depend upon the total number of men in the two Forces, I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to a comparison in numbers made between these two Forces by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War on September 27 last. The noble Viscount is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"Instead of a nominal 250,000 Volunteers and Yeomanry which they previously possessed, they had now 273,000 Territorials."</quote>
<col>268</col>
I find, by referring to the General Annual Report on the British Army published in 1911 that the total strength of the Yeomanry and Volunteers on October 1, 1906, excluding the Permanent Staff, was 278,719, which is not a nominal 250,000. We now know that the strength of the Territorial Army on the 1st of October was not 273,000 but 264,167. In making the comparison the noble Viscount has added to the Territorial Army 8,833 officers and men who were not present, and at the same time has dispensed with 28,719 officers and men from the Volunteers and Yeomanry who were actually present and serving. Consequently in making the comparison between the two Forces the noble Viscount has credited the Territorial Force with 37,552 men to whom they are in no manner of way entitled. If the noble Viscount wishes to make a comparison between the old Auxiliary Forces and his new Territorial Army which shall be favourable to the latter, I think he would do well to avoid the point of numbers and rely upon the excellence of his paper organisation. The Territorial Army will be fewer in numbers than the old Auxiliary Forces but will cost more. How much more, if bounties and bonuses are to be given, rewards paid for bringing recruits, and separation allowances granted, it will be difficult to estimate.<lb/>
The important point is the efficiency of the Territorial Army for the purpose for which it is maintained. The old Auxiliary Forces were condemned lock, stock and barrel, by a Royal Commission as inefficient. I trust that we may before long see this Report on the Territorial Army by Sir John French, and that he will inform us if that Force is efficient for the purpose for which it exists, namely, to be able to defeat beyond all doubt 70,000 Continental invaders in the absence of the entire Regular Army. On the departure of the Expeditionary Force we are left at home with four Regular battalions of Infantry, three regiments of Cavalry, and some 16,000 Artillery Reservists. I have often mentioned these figures in your Lordships' House, and they have never been challenged. The noble Viscount has mentioned that 100,000 Special Reservists would be available for home defence after the departure of the Expeditionary Force. But the noble Viscount has also told us that the Special Reserve was not for mobilisation. Again, in the Special Reserve are 27 fourth battalions earmarked for
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0139"/>
<col>269</col>
service abroad with the Expeditionary Force. You cannot have these battalions abroad and at home at the same time.<lb/>
In Question 6 the noble Earl asks how many men have qualified in musketry. The musketry of the Territorial Army is a perfect puzzle. But this much I have grasped, by a laborious study of War Office orders and letters, that in the Territorial Army there are two ways of qualifying in musketry. One is in virtue of the value of hits made on the target; the other is in virtue of discharging a certain number of rounds quite irrespective of hitting the object aimed at. In short, men may qualify by hitting or by missing the target. I submit that it is necessary that these two classes should be separated into distinct headings&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) men qualified by hitting the target, and (<i>b</i>) men qualified by missing the target the required number of times. Unless the return is separated, as I suggest, it is of no value. It would also be useful to add the number of men who have not fired at all, or who have not completed the musketry course.<lb/>
The noble Earl, in Question 7, touches on the horse supply problem. There is no need to discuss that subject any further, because the noble Viscount has announced to the country in the most decided terms that the problem is now solved beyond all question. Speaking at Birmingham on October 25 last, the noble Viscount is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"There were a number of problems on which they were working now. He was glad to say the horse problem, not only for the Territorial Force but for the Regulars, was practically solved, although it had been deemed insuperable. It was quite true that the motor car had superseded a great many horses, but it superseded them in the Army as well as outside. Large portions of the transport were now conducted with motor cars, and that relieved them from the obligation of providing a certain number of horses, and, for the rest, there were enough and to spare by a large margin in this country for all the requirements of the Army."</quote>
I understand from that statement that if the Regular Army and the Territorial Force were mobilised to-morrow, there would be enough horses and to spare by a large margin. There is a finality about that beyond which I shall not attempt to go.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01090"><member>LORD WYNFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, might I ask the noble Viscount to make the answer to Question 8 a little clearer? Do I understand that no account is taken
<col>270</col>
of fire tactics during the practice of the Horse and Field Artillery batteries? If not, how is it possible to arrive at any idea of the efficiency of the batteries? Fire tactics is a most important matter, and it is the chief difficulty that occurs with the Territorial Horse and Field Artillery batteries. It is a matter in which it is very difficult to give them practical training and instruction.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MILITARY MAN&#x0152;UVRES BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01093" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01094">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01095"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill introduces no new subject. In the year 1905 a Bill similar in most material respects passed through your Lordships' House and was a good deal discussed. The Military Man&#x0153;uvres Act which was passed in 1897 was a very useful measure, but those who promoted it felt themselves bound to go in a very careful and gingerly fashion, with the result that they tied themselves up a good deal. It has proved a very valuable Act, and the only reason for now wishing to amend it is that experience has shown certain points on which it is thought that, without initiating hardship on anybody, indeed with general goodwill, improvements can be made. This Bill is not in all respects the same as the Bill of 1905, but it is in the main the same.<lb/>
The purpose of the Bill is this. I will take the case of what happened last year. We scheduled certain districts in the eastern counties and meant to have man&#x0153;uvres there, but the drought made it undesirable to hold the man&#x0153;uvres. The result was that, having surveyed the ground and everybody being really anxious that we should go there, we found ourselves unable to go there next year, as under the law as it stands the same area cannot be scheduled for man&#x0153;uvres more
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0140"/>
<col>271</col>
than once in five years. It does seem right that in a case of that kind you should be entitled to go there notwithstanding that the period of five years prescribed in the Act of 1897 has not elapsed. Further, it seems right that if you have been to a particular area and the people there, the county council, for instance, say they would like to see you back again two years or three years afterwards, that you should be able to go. This Bill on this point proposes to do two things. If you actually have not gone to the place, then it is as if it had never been scheduled and you can schedule it again. If, on the other hand, you have gone and the county council asks you to come back two or three years afterwards, it may be, then, if everybody desires it, you can schedule the area again and go back. That is the first change which it is proposed to make.<lb/>
Another change is this. Subsection (2) of Section 1 of the existing Act requires a draft of the Order in Council authorising man&#x0153;uvres to be sent to the county, borough, district, and parish councils of the area affected not less than six months before the Order is to come into force. Under subsection (3) of Clause I of this Bill, this period of six months is reduced to four, in cases where the draft is sent out before the 30th of April in any year.<lb/>
There is another provision which really causes enormous embarrassment. As your Lordships know, under the Military Man&#x0153;uvres Act, 1897, there is a Military Man&#x0153;uvres Commission, which is not military but is appointed by the local bodies, and to which the Secretary of State appoints a certain number of civilians, always less in number than those elected by the representative bodies. That Commission says where within the scheduled area the troops are not to go. As the law at present stands, it says that you are not to go upon certain ground which might cause inconvenience to the public. That is quite Tight. But there are certain places where the Military Man&#x0153;uvres Commission cannot allow the troops to go even where no harm is done. These places include all plantations and woods. The result is sometimes disastrous. Nobody wishes the Commission to schedule a plantation where damage would be done, but I remember at three o'clock one morning watching man&#x0153;vres at sunrise, and I saw a brigade come up and attack an entrenched position, and even with my lay eyes and inexperience
<col>272</col>
I saw that the attack which had been ordered was an attack which could only end in the utter destruction of the attacking force. I asked the Inspector-General who was with me why this was. Had I judged wrongly "No," he said, "my language about it would be very much stronger than yours." These troops could have come up protected by fire from the woods on each side, and it would have been a perfectly legitimate military operation, but the Military Man&#x0153;uvres Act does not allow anybody to go into woods under any circumstances. The result is we never can carry out effective military man&#x0153;euvres. What we suggest is that, subject to the careful control of the Military Man&#x0153;uvres Commission&#x2014;and I again remind your Lordships that this is a civilian Commission&#x2014;permission may be given to operate in certain woods and parks which are at present shut to the military.<lb/>
I come now to a point in which my noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu is interested. The existing Act gives power to two justices to order roads in the man&#x0153;uvre areas to be closed for not more than twenty-four hours, or, in the case of main roads, not more than twelve hours, but the procedure for obtaining such an order is very cumbrous. It requires seven days to get such an order. What we are anxious for is that we should be at liberty to apply to the justices for authority without the seven days elapsing, and the provisions as to notice are in this Bill made more elastic. The time during which the use of main roads may be suspended is not to exceed six hours in any one day; and in the case of main roads where there would be inconvenience to the public we should not be likely under any circumstances to apply to the justices to make an order. But we are tied up unduly by the provisions of the Military Man&#x0153;uvres Act as they already stand, and we ask to be freed from them.<lb/>
There is another clause which is new. On various occasions attempts have been made by persons whose lands or water supplies had been made "authorised" lands or supplies to escape from their liability to have them actually used during the man&#x0153;uvres by putting up notices suggesting that entry on the lands or use of the supplies was unlawful. Clause 4 imposes on persons who act in this manner liability to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;5, which.
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0141"/>
<col>273</col>
is the penalty for certain offences under the existing Act.<lb/>
Then there is a Scottish clause. On the Man&#x0153;uvres Commission in England you have to have representatives of the county and other large boroughs in the area over which the Commission operates. When the Bill was passing through Parliament a clause was put in for Scotland, by which every royal burgh, parliamentary burgh, or police burgh, was put in the same position as an English county borough. The result is that in Scotland the Man&#x0153;uvres Commissions have become quite unwieldy. Nobody wants this, and we propose to alter it. These are the main provisions of the Bill. I think they are not very onerous; they certainly would enormously arid to the value of the machinery of the Military Man&#x0153;vres Act of 1897, which I think was a child of the noble Marquess's opposite. That Act has worked extraordinarily well, but we have outgrown it, and what we want is to adapt the Act to the circumstances which experience has shown us we ought to deal with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01096">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Haldane</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01097"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to delay the House on the Second Reading of this Bill, with the general principles of which I am entirely in harmony, but there are two or three points about it which possibly in Committee may be arranged. One is with regard to main roads. I do not think the noble Viscount's advisers have quite realised how important main roads are. Take the Great North-road, the Bath-road, and about thirteen roads of that nature. These, I think, might very easily be exempted from the operation of the Bill by inserting a schedule to that effect at the end. It would be, I submit, almost as unfair to interrupt the traffic on the Great North-road as it would be to stop the traffic on the Great Northern Railway at some point between, say, York and London. There is another point, affecting the New Forest. In the case of the New Forest there have always been words inserted in Military Man&#x0153;uvres Acts defining the Verderers Court as the authority to declare it a man&#x0153;uvre area. Possibly between now and the Committee stage there may be something done by the noble Viscount on his side which may lead to a reassurance on these points.</membercontribution></p>
<col>274</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01098"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no doubt that this Bill contains points which may be conveniently examined when we arrive at the Committee stage, but I rise simply for the purpose of welcoming the Bill as a whole and expressing the opinion, which I think will be generally shared in the House, that the proposals of His Majesty's Government for strengthening the hands of the military authorities in connection with man&#x0153;uvres are reasonable proposals. In fact, in our view this Bill is an overdue Bill, and some change of the law such as that now contemplated might well have been made before now. The proposal that leave should be given to use the same area in certain circumstances more than once in live years, with the consent of the county council; the proposal that the notice given to the local authorities should be shortened from six to four months; the proposal that the proceedings for closing roads should be rendered less cumbrous; and the proposal that the Military Man&#x0153;uvres Commission should be given leave to include lands enclosed as woods and plantations within the man&#x0153;uvring area&#x2014;all these are, to my mind, distinctly legitimate amplifications of the powers now given to those, responsible for the conduct of these very valuable instructional proceedings.<lb/>
In connection with the question of including woods and plantations within the man&#x0153;uvring area, I am well aware that there has been a good deal of suspicion and heart-burning in the past. I am, perhaps, entitled to be heard as a witness, because I have filled the office which the noble Viscount opposite now fills; and not only that, but I happen to live in a part of the country which is within measurable distance of Salisbury Plain and therefore gets perhaps more than its share i of man&#x0153;uvring. And if the House will not think me too egotistical, I will add that I was Lord Cardwell's Under-Secretary when the first man&#x0153;uvres were instituted, and I have a lively recollection of the difficulties we then had to encounter in coming to terms with those controlling large areas within the districts which were to be used for the man&#x0153;euvres. But there has undoubtedly been a considerable movement I of public opinion in favour of giving greater opportunities to the troops to make use of the surface of the country without restriction and reservation, and I attribute
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0142"/>
<col>275</col>
that change, which I think is a most fortunate one, to the fact that not only have the military authorities always shown themselves most courteous and considerate to those with whom they were brought into contact on these occasions, but that the conduct of the troops themselves has, so far as I am aware of these things, been beyond all praise and has really given hardly any occasion for public or private complaint. The general feeling, I think, in the part of England that I know best is that the people are glad to see the troops, and glad to have them back again when they have been in the country once.<lb/>
I think the noble Viscount was also quite justified in dwelling upon the fact that this Bill places us in the hands of Commissioners, who are a body not by any means purely military in their complexion, but composed partly of a military and partly of a civilian element, and so composed that the civilian element preponderates in numerical strength. We have the less hesitation in supporting this Bill because, as the noble Viscount truly said, a great many of the proposals which it contains are to be found in the Bill which the late Government introduced and. were unable to proceed with, I presume owing to the difficulties anticipated by the then Secretary of State in another place. But I think, as I said just now, that there is a great support from public opinion, a support that seems to me to increase with every year that passes, and that the general feeling in the country now is that the efficiency of the troops must come before all other considerations, and that any sacrifices which individuals are called upon to make in order that their training may be satisfactory are, after all, a comparatively small matter, and not sacrifices which any of us need hesitate to make. I therefore gladly give my support to the noble Viscount's Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ROAD BOARD.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01122"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEALTLIEU</member> rose to call attention to the Report of the Road Board, and to ask His Majesty's Government if an official return of the number of motor cars, motor cycles, and commercial motor vehicles can be published annually.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01123">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I make no apology for introducing this subject to-day, and I ask the House to listen for a moment or two to a few remarks I have to make on the First Report of the Road Board before I proceed to the definite Question which I have put down on the Notice Paper, which is to ask His Majesty's Government whether an official return can be published annually of the number of motor cars, motor cycles, and commercial motor vehicles. All of these are paying taxes, and most of the figures regarding them should, therefore, be obtainable from the Excise authorities. This being the first Report of the Road Board, it is, naturally, of great interest, not only to those who pay the taxes and to those who are interested in road matters, but also to the local authorities. Your Lordships will remember that when the Road Board was originally set up under the Budget of 1909, it was set up as part of the Development Board, and was contained in the same Bill as included the provisions for setting up that Board. But it is a Board Totally different from the Development Board, and it collects taxes from one class only&#x2014;namely, from the users of mechanical vehicles; and it spends this money in co-operation with local authorities upon roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01124">The first Report of the Road Board covers a period of thirteen and a-half months, and it is therefore rather difficult, in criticising some parts of the Report, to deal with it quite easily, because the financial periods dealt with are different from the periods dealt with in the body of the Report. For instance, the revenue which has been collected is only given up to March 31, the end of the financial year, for reasons which I perfectly understand; but the effect is that, as in other cases different periods are given, comparison is made somewhat difficult. I should like to say how much I congratulate the Road Board on their general policy. It is a perfectly right and fair policy for all concerned&#x2014;namely, that they should not give grants to local authorities without the co-operation of those authorities.</p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0144"/>
<col>279</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01125">They are quite right in not giving doles broadcast to local authorities unless those authorities have some interest, direct and pecuniary, in the spending of the money; and if it ever came about that the Road Board, through pressure of any kind were compelled to give grants other than in accordance with this principle, it would be a very bad thing for the Road Board fund, and would lead almost certainly to a great falling off in time proper way in which these grants are spent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01126">The revenue collected in the period dealt with in the Report amounted to &#x00A3;1,426,000, but I will assume, for the purposes of my argument this afternoon, that up to date at least &#x00A3;2,000,000 has been collected. The only complaint I have to make on the financial score is this, that the Road Board seems to have kept back some of the money before distributing to the local authorities, the exact cause for which is not apparent. For instance, until quite late in this year practically no money had been dispersed to local authorities. I do not know whether any great technical difficulties, either financial or engineering, prevented this; but only seventy-five per cent. of the grants promised have been paid. If that is due to a spirit of commendable caution, I have no fault to find. But I think the practice of the Road Board in investing large sums in Government securities pending the distribution of the money is a somewhat risky policy. Surely it would be better financially if that money were put on deposit in the Bank of England, or dealt with in such a way that the capital would remain untouched. I may remind the noble Lord who is going to reply on behalf of His Majesty's Government that if a European war supervened, or there was a financial crisis of magnitude, there would be a serious fall in Consols and other securities, and this might seriously deplete the funds of the Road Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01127">In Ireland there appears to have been only &#x00A3;25,000 collected, a sum which seems to me totally inadequate. We all know that in Ireland the taxation set up under the Budget of 1909 in regard to mechanical vehicles is difficult to enforce. But it looks as if there had been slackness in Ireland in collecting the revenue, and it is common knowledge that there are motor-cars all over Ireland in respect of which taxes have not been paid. If that is so, I hope His Majesty's Government
<col>280</col>
will see that the revenue of the Road Board is properly collected in Ireland. There is a complaint in the body of the Report from Irish county councils that a sufficient sum has not been given to Ireland. I can see no ground for this. While a sum of &#x00A3;25,000 only was collected from Ireland, the sum of &#x00A3;150,000 was given back for the improvement of Irish roads. Most people&#x2014;I am sure England would be glad to be in that position&#x2014;would be pleased if they got back six times what they contributed. I fully realise that the trunk roads in Ireland need more attention than the trunk roads in England; but looking to the future and the possibility of Home Rule becoming law, the Irish Government must not expect that the motorists who possess cars in this country are always going to subsidise Ireland to the extent of &#x00A3;125,000 a year in future. The principle should be that where the money is raised there it should be largely spent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01128">From Scotland &#x00A3;73,000 was collected, in round figures, and Scotland got back &#x00A3;175,000, but there is better reason in the case of Scotland why more should be given. A large number of English cars use the Scottish roads in the autumn, and Scotland has on the whole tried to keep its roads up to a high standard of efficiency. The roads south of Perth are in many cases the admiration of English engineers. In the far northern counties they are not nearly so good, and the Road Board might devote attention to the county of Sutherland to see that money given there is wisely used. There is still a lingering prejudice there against mechanical vehicles. The county councils of the more northern counties have still a feeling that the money is wasted which is expended in making roads fit for mechanical vehicles.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01129">Now I pass to some general remarks about the Report of the Road Board. Reading what is in the Report, and having in mind also the debates which have taken place in various county and borough councils, I must first of all say that I think the claim of certain county councils to have grants of money without spending any of their own is not a sound one. In the case of the Norfolk County Council, I believe great indignation was expressed because the Road Board would not spend money without receiving a local contribution. I gather from the Report that the policy of the Road Board is that they will con-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0145"/>
<col>281</col>
tribute anything up to two-thirds or three-fourths of the expenditure if the local authority will provide the remainder, and that seems to me a reasonable policy. Local authorities also grumble at the cost of collection. Your Lordships will remember that when this new taxation was set up it was specially stipulated that &#x00A3;150,000 was to be set apart out of the estimated revenue of &#x00A3;750,000 a year, or twenty per cent., to take the place of the licence duties which had lapsed in consequence of the new form of taxation, so that local authorities already get, in addition to the grants they receive, &#x00A3;150,000 in lieu of the lapsed licence duties. Therefore I do not think that these authorities have any ground for complaint. Assuming for a moment that the complaint of county and borough councils that it is expensive and difficult to collect the licence money for motor-cars and motor vehicles generally is a good complaint, it would be better, possibly, to substitute a percentage to be paid to local authorities rather than the fixed sum of &#x00A3;150,000 a year. The effect of a percentage would be to quicken the sense of collection in the minds of the local authorities. When they get a fixed sum, whether they collect little or much, I do not think it appeals to them in the same way that it would if they were given a percentage on the amount collected. That is only human nature. I suggest that this percentage should be in the proportion originally fixed in the Budget&#x2014;namely, twenty per cent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01130">To deal with one or two other questions. I would remark that the Road Board is to be congratulated on the general way in which the money has been spent. I know they had a temptation set before them to go into many new schemes of road building and to spend their money in various other ways, but they stuck in the main to what is a really sound policy&#x2014;namely, the provision of a proper foundation for the roads of this country, a foundation which will enable the superstructure put upon it to carry the heavier traffic which the roads have to carry to-day. If some day they decide to build experimental roads, I hope it will be done after careful consideration. Primarily, we want to have our roads dustless and mudless before any ambitious schemes of this sort are entered into. No one who has motored about England and Scotland this year can have helped being struck with the
<col>282</col>
increase in the mileage of tarred roads. Already half of the villages which undoubtedly suffered from dust, and in the winter from mud splashing, have regained their position as places in which it is pleasant to live, and the poor people residing in these villages can now have their windows open in hot weather. I myself sincerely sympathise with people who suffer from the dust nuisance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01131"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: The dust is made by the motor-cars.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01132"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount says that the dust is made by the motor cars. It is raised by the motor-cars, but its existence is due to bad road-making. I think the next step of the Road Board should be to consider the question of by-pass roads. We all know the case of Coln brook and of Kingston. I take those two as instances of which your Lordships are well aware. In both cases an immense traffic has to pass through thoroughfares which are inadequate to carry that traffic, and there are many other such places. The whole of the traffic of time Bath road, leading to the West of England and South Wales, passes through Colnbrook. A speed limit has had to be fixed, and the thoroughfare here is ridiculously narrow and consequently very dangerous. The road originally was wide enough for this traffic, but encroachments have narrowed what used to be a fine thoroughfare before the existence of railways. In the case of Kingston we have there a very dangerous place filled with trams and ordinary local traffic, including motor lorry traffic. This traffic has to pass through the narrow streets of Kingston all through the summer when the streets are crowded, and the result is a very dangerous state of things. These are two cases in which the Road Board might well consider whether they could not construct experimental by-pass roads with advantage to the public. They have power to take land as well, and I am sure if the frontages were taken on each side of the newly-made road they would bring something back towards the cost.<lb/>
I think a word ought to be said about London. The case of London, of course, is peculiar. Street widenings in London have depended largely on the question of trams. I am not going to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0146"/>
<col>283</col>
throw any stones at the London County Council, either the present Council or former Councils, but it is well known, and it is quite natural, as they are the owners of the biggest tramway system in this country, that they prefer to widen streets which affect their traffic. The result is that there are many roads which need to be widened, but of which, as they possess no tramway traffic, the County Council do not seem to desire to undertake the widening. This question of widenings will eventually have to be undertaken. The sooner it is done the better, for land all round London is increasing immensely in value, and the result is that in a few years' time the making of a great trunk road out of London will cost far more than it would to-day. It is to be hoped that the County Council will see their way to co-operate with the Road Board in this matter, and not look at it only from the point of view of tramways, because it is doubtful whether tramways will be the best means of locomotion in towns in the future.<lb/>
The London General Omnibus Company this year have given an order for 10,000,000 gallons of petrol at 1&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> per gallon, which means that they are paying over &#x00A3;61,000 towards the funds of the Road Board; but this company do not get one penny advantage out of that taxation. Until the outskirts of London are reached&#x2014;the London General Omnibus Company hardly run on any roads within the area touched by the Road Board&#x2014;they will get practically no advantage out of this huge taxation which they pay. I am not quarrelling with the taxation. I believe the petrol tax is the easiest collected for the purpose, and I am not criticising it, but I do think when London pays such a large proportion of the total amount of revenue collected London should have more consideration than it gets at present in the spending of the money. But I agree that the London County Council must co-operate, and I hope that the hands of the Road Board will be strengthened in this direction, and that they will be able to come to some arrangement with the London County Council.<lb/>
Now I come to the definite Question which I have placed on the Paper. It is the habit of many journals&#x2014;I myself have done it on several occasions&#x2014;to collect
<col>284</col>
statistics of the numbers of motor cars registered in this country from the various local authorities. There are about 250 of these authorities, and their returns may or may not be correct. I am not saying that the clerks to the county councils do not do their best to give correct returns, but it is very difficult for them to do so because cars continually change hands, and they have no correct list, at any rate of commercial vans, in their county. Then cars change hands from county to county. There is only one way of getting at the correct number, and that is from the number that pay the tax to the Excise authorities. If the noble Lord who will reply to my Question can give some hope that the Government will have an annual return compiled in the way that I have suggested on the Paper&#x2014;namely, with the amount paid by each class of vehicle set down clearly&#x2014;we should be able to say more or less how many vehicles of all sorts there are in the country and the amount of taxation paid by each. It would be a most useful return from many points of view. Clerks of local authorities have written to me saying that, although they have incurred expenditure on account of improvements with the sanction of the Road Board, they find it difficult to get the money promptly. Unless county councils have large revenues they have to undergo considerable inconvenience if they do not get the money promptly, and now that the grants in aid from the Exchequer have been diminished, it is a hardship on local authorities when they do not get the grants paid to them by the Road Board as soon as possible, and it involves them sometimes in interest on loans and difficulties of that kind.<lb/>
In conclusion, may I say that I rose this afternoon, as the House will have understood, not with the intention of criticising harshly the Road Board, but of calling attention to various matters raised in their Report. I repeat that I think their general policy has been sound, but I think we may ask that in their next Report they should give more information than is given in the first Report. I recognise, of course, that the period covered in the first Report is a broken one, and that the Board had not got fully to work. I know that they are doing their best, and that there may be points later on to criticise which may be better now left untouched. I think, on the whole, we should try and strengthen
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0147"/>
<col>285</col>
the hands of the Road Board, and give them more powers. I look forward to the time when the Road Board will be the embodiment of a national authority for national roads. Some day or other the trunk roads of this country must become national roads. Here is the machinery and the funds by which that can be carried out, and when that time comes perhaps the only part of Mr. Lloyd George's proposals in his famous Budget with which we shall all agree will be the part in which he set up the Road Board and provided funds for this purpose. I can assure His Majesty's Government that as far as motorists in general are concerned they are anxious to assist the Road Board to bring its labours to a favourable conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01133"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD or AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure there is no member of your Lordships' House who is more entitled than my noble friend who has just sat down to raise questions of the kind he has raised to-day, and no member of your Lordships' House speaks with greater weight than he does on these subjects. Therefore I am sure it will be a source of great gratification to the Road Board to know that their policy has met with the general approval of an authority so widely recognised on this subject as Lord Montagu. I think we may all agree that the work of the Road Board, as far as we have seen it at the present moment, does deserve the encomiums that it has received. It was a body set up to undertake an entirely new task. The Board are now well on in the second year of their work, and I should think that there is no bit of public work that has encountered such little criticism and has met with such general approval as the work that has been done by Sir George Gibb (the Chairman) and the other members of the Road Board.<lb/>
The noble Lord raised the question of the Board's general policy. That is laid down quite clearly in their Report. They have, as they say, during these early stages in their career confined themselves rather to assisting a considerable number of smaller operations. As they themselves say, they think the most important thing, the thing that will do most good at the present time, is improving the surface of roads. The noble Lord suggested that
<col>286</col>
possibly they were not spending their money quite fast enough. As is clearly shown in their Report, although they are at the present time confining themselves to what I may call minor operations, they have in mind the fact that it will become necessary for them before very long to undertake larger works and works of greater importance, which will cause an expenditure of much larger sums of money; and while they are, on the one hand, keeping sufficient balance in hand to meet these bigger operations which they will no doubt undertake, at the same time they are spending as much money as can be profitably spent, subject to that proviso, on the general improvement; of the roads of the country.<lb/>
I think there has been only one really serious criticism levelled at the Road Board, and that has come largely from county councils and their representatives, and I was glad to notice that the noble Lord did not in any way associate himself with that criticism. I refer to the contention that the Road Board should, for every improvement that it sanctions and is prepared to support, pay the whole of the cost, instead of paying, as it does at the present moment, seventy-five per cent. Paragraph 34 of the Report makes very clear the reasons why they have adopted that policy. They have taken the line which has been so often, and, I think, advantageously, taken in the case of the grant of Government money, that you get work done more economically and more carefully if the authority which has the spending of the money&#x2014;in this case the local authority responsible for the road&#x2014;does have to contribute a certain amount of the cost. And besides that, which I think is an undeniable advantage, they are also reinforced in that position by the general attitude which they have adopted in these cases. After all, the Road Board was never intended, I think, to relieve local authorities of the burden which has always been placed upon them of maintaining the roads; its view of its duty is that it should share with those local authorities the increasing burden of the maintenance of the roads caused by motor traffic.<lb/>
The noble Lord raised what I suppose is probably the largest, most expensive, and most difficult problem which is going to confront the Road Board, and that is the problem of what is going to be done in the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0148"/>
<col>287</col>
case of London. As the noble Lord will see from the Report, the Road Board are by no means neglecting London at the present moment. The problem of what is the best thing to do with London, as you will see from paragraph 27, is engaging their attention, and, as they say themselves, anything which you are going to do in London which is to be of a satisfactory nature will require a policy of concentrated effort and assistance. That is obviously one of the big works which will have to be taken in hand in the future, and which will cost an enormous sum of money. It is impossible to say what it will cost, and I think the Road Board would have laid themselves open to the fair criticism, had they started in the early days of their career with a big scheme for London, that they were embarking upon a somewhat rash policy by taking the biggest and most difficult problems first.<lb/>
Then there is the question of Ireland. I think we have some reason to agree with what the noble Lord said. There is strong ground for suspecting that there are a considerable number of Irish cars in respect of which licences are not paid at the present time. Of course, the position in Ireland is very different from the position in England. Ireland is a happy country where until motor car licences were instituted nobody had to pay any of what are known as establishment licences&#x2014;licences on carriages, dogs, and so on&#x2014;which are in England and Wales collected by the local authorities. Therefore the Irish county councils and county borough councils had no previous experience at all of the collection of these taxes. It was entirely new work which was being thrown upon them. In these circumstances one has to make a certain amount of allowance for the fact that they have not, perhaps, been able to straightway do their work in the manner in which we hope it will be done. The Treasury are well aware of that, and are moving in the matter. The Irish Local Government Board has called the attention of the local authorities to what their duties are in this matter, and I think there is under discussion a proposal that possibly the services of the Irish Constabulary, which is not on the same footing as the police in this country, might be enlisted where necessary in this work. Therefore we have every reason for hoping that a considerable improvement will be shown in this respect in the future.<lb/>
<col>288</col>
The noble Lord called attention to how disproportionate the contribution of Ireland was to the amount which it receives it is quite true that Ireland does receive from the Road Board a good deal more than it finds in the way of money derived from licences, but the noble Lord left out one thing, and that is the amount derived from motor spirit. We have no available figures on that point, because a great deal of motor spirit comes into England and pays the Excise duty here and is afterwards sent over to Ireland. But that does not alter the fact that Ireland does receive a great deal more money from the Road Board than it pays.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01134"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member> I took into consideration the point to which the noble Lord has referred. The figures are&#x2014;&#x00A3;14,907 from motor spirit duties in Ireland, and &#x00A3;17,452 from motor cars.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01135"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I think that is quite true of spirit which is brought directly into Ireland and pays duty there. But there is a good deal of spirit which pays duty in England and is afterwards taken across to Ireland, and which, therefore, does not appear in those figures. It is not a very important point anyhow.<lb/>
Then I come to the question of delay in payment. We would be very glad if the noble Lord would give us further information about that. I understand that the general policy of the Road Board is to pay a portion of the grant in advance as soon as the council are ready to commence work, and they have had no complaints as to lack of promptness on their part in making the further payments. They would be the last people in the world to want to put local authorities in a difficulty in the matter, and any complaint of the sort that was brought forward would, I am sure, receive prompt consideration from them.<lb/>
I now come to the last point which the noble Lord raised&#x2014;the question of numbers. The noble Lord probably knows the numbers that are published in the Report of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs and Excise, but that information, of course, does not give all that the noble Lord wants. It gives motor cycles, motor cars, and hackney motors, and the numbers of those are as follows. There are 48,857 motor cycles, 75,617 motor cars, and 33,199
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0149"/>
<col>289</col>
hackney motors, the term "hackney motor" including the ordinary taxi-cab and such things as motor 'buses and tramcars, and no differentiation is actually made. They are not classified in that sense, though Table 92 of I he Report does give them by weights; and it is stated in the Blue-book that it has not been found possible at present to show separately the several kinds of hackney motor carriages in use. But, generally speaking, motor omnibuses are to be found in column 5, which gives the hackney motors which exceed two tons but do not exceed five tons, and their number is given as 1,887. Motor cabs and tramcars are included in column 3. That column is one ton or under, or exceeding five tons," and their number is 22,720.<lb/>
With regard to commercial motors&#x2014;that is, motors which do not pay an annual licence&#x2014;I am afraid it is impossible to supply any sufficient <i>data</i> at all. As these motors do not pay an annual licence they are only registered once in their existence, and they are not necessarily removed from the register when their life comes to an end and they are broken up. One could, no doubt, get from the registering authorities the numbers of commercial motors that have been registered, but it would not help very much, because one would never know how many of them have ceased to exist. Therefore I am afraid, with regard to commercial motors, we cannot give the noble Lord what lie wants, but with regard to other motors we do at the present moment receive from the local authorities who collect the licence duties a return of the number of motors and the duties that they have paid; so that it would be quite possible to publish, if the noble Lord wanted it, a statement as to the number of motor cars by counties, and, secondly, the number of different classes which pay the different scales of licence duty. I understand that that would largely meet the point which the noble Lord raises. I think I have replied on most of the points to which the noble Lord has called attention. I can assure him that the Road Board will be only too ready to consider the points which he has raised in his speech, and I am sure, as I said at the beginning, that it will be a source of gratification to them to know that in the noble Lord's view they are, as we all think, conducting their work in a most admirable fashion.</membercontribution></p>
<col>290</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01136"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend behind me (Lord Montagu) no doubt approaches this subject with great knowledge from the point of view of those who own and use motor cars and those who are interested in the development of motor traffic on our roads. But listening, to his speech, I confess it appeared to me that he gave no sufficient consideration, if any consideration at all, to the views of those who approach it from a different standpoint&#x2014;namely, the county councils, which represent those who have to pay the main burden of maintaining the roads, and persons using the roads who are not fortunate enough to be owners of motor cars. I think the speech of my noble friend was based upon an entirely wrong assumption. Re secured to assume that, however great and rapid the traffic on our roads might be, the main cost of maintaining the roads ought still to fall on the ratepayers. The history of turnpike trusts shows that tins view was not accepted when roads had to be practically re-made for stage coach traffic, and it cannot be accepted now. There is, no doubt, a small contribution now made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer towards the cost of maintaining our roads, and the tax imposed upon motors and upon petrol is a slight addition to that contribution, but in my mind it is not nearly enough, and this whole subject, as motor traffic develops, will have to be entirely reconsidered by the Government of the day with a view to a much greater share of the maintenance of the roads being imposed in some way or other on the general public and on those who use the roads for this rapid and heavy traffic.<lb/>
My noble friend has complimented the Road board on the way in which they have carried out their duties. I have no desire whatever to criticise them. They had a difficult task to perform, and they have judged as between the competing claims of different parts of the country for assistance, I have no doubt, with great fairness and generally upon proper lines. Where a suggestion has been made to them for making a new road, or for lowering a hill, or for cutting off corners, or for widening a road, they have been perfectly right in maintaining the principle that the locality should bear a certain proportion of the cost of the improvement, because such improvements are for the benefit of all classes of traffic over the roads. But I cannot take that view where it is
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0150"/>
<col>291</col>
a question of improving the surface of the road by tarring or otherwise in order to get rid of the dust nuisance. The dust nuisance is solely due to motors. I ventured to tell my noble friend when he was speaking that the motors make the dust. At any rate, they raise it. There was no such nuisance before the invention of motors as there is now, where cottages in village streets and villas close to main roads near London are rendered simply uninhabitable by dust raised by motors. Therefore do think that the funds derived from the taxation of motors or petrol ought to bear the entire cost of the improvement of the surface which is necessary to prevent the nuisance which the motors cause, instead of imposing the burden on the ratepayers; in other words, I would suggest that the Road Board ought to make grants for such purposes without requiring a contribution from the locality.<lb/>
I know that Parliament has laid clown in the Act under which the Road Board works the principle that these taxes upon motors and petrol are not intended to relieve the ratepayers of any burden that previously fell upon them. I voted against that, and I do not think it was a fair principle to accept; but it has been accepted, and I do not wish to argue that question now. I do, however, wish to say that I do not think motors are sufficiently taxed at present considering the mischief they do to the roads, and I hope that the Road Board will reconsider, with regard to the surface of roads, their rule of requiring a local contribution before they contribute anything to that purpose.</membercontribution></p>

Although it does not give all the information I should like to have, it goes a long way in that direction. With regard to what the noble Viscount has just said, I think he must have forgotten that in the old coaching days dust existed to an even greater extent than it does to-day, as the pictures and records of the time show. There was dust in those days on every main road where there was much traffic. I fully admit that motor cars raise dust, and they are now paying, quite rightly, for the alleviation of this nuisance. With regard to the claim of the county councils, I think the noble Viscount forgets that in addition to the actual

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01154"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the proposals which are contained in this Bill have on former occasions had the advantage of the clearness and the cogency which characterise, as your Lordships well know, the eloquence of the Lord Chancellor in addressing this House, and therefore I must plead for special indulgence in endeavouring to explain them to your Lordships on this occasion. This Bill applies solely to Scotland, and is intended to accomplish three main purposes. First, it is a Land Tenure Bill for existing small holdings, and for that purpose it amends and extends the Crofters Acts. Secondly, it provides machinery for the creation of new small holdings in Scotland. Thirdly, it seeks to establish a Board of Agriculture for Scotland, which it is intended should
<col>294</col>
be fully equipped to promote agriculture, forestry, and other rural industries in all their branches. These purposes, though I have divided them, are closely related and interdependent, and the Government regard each one of them as an integral and vital portion of this Bill. Since July, 1906, when the proposals which this Bill contains were first introduced in the House of Commons, several other Bills dealing with the same subject have been laid before the Houses of Parliament, and opinion may, I think, fairly be described as having advanced upon the subject. Those who advocate and believe in small holdings are more numerous, and I trust I am not wrong in entertaining the hope that there will be a greater measure of agreement in regard to these proposals to-day than there has been hitherto.<lb/>
In its first form this Bill was laid before Parliament in July, 1906. In 1907, after having been read a second time in the House of Commons by a very large majority&#x2014;something like 239&#x2014;it passed through all its stages and came up to this House. This House at the time did not see its way to give the Bill a Second Reading. In the following year&#x2014;1908&#x2014;after the Bill had passed again through the House of Commons, being supported by even greater majorities, this House rejected it on Second Reading by 153 votes to 33. The following year&#x2014;1909&#x2014;was the year of the great Budget controversy, and there was then no hope of making progress with a measure of this kind. In the succeeding year&#x2014;1910&#x2014;two General Elections took place. The net deduction from the transactions of these years is this, that through two General Elections and in three Parliaments the proposals contained in this Bill have had the strong and determined support of a very large majority of the electors of Scotland and of public opinion in that country. This has been reflected in the House of Commons. In 1906 the vast majority of the Members returned for Scotland supported this Bill, but there were even a greater number in the two succeeding Parliaments&#x2014;this Parliament and the Parliament which preceded it. I think it may be said that rarely has any Bill received more marked indications of strong public support being behind it.<lb/>
It has been said, I admit&#x2014;and I dare say it may be said again&#x2014;that there is
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0152"/>
<col>295</col>
no substantial support for this Bill, that agricultural opinion does not support it. Well, agricultural opinion, like other opinion, has various modes of expressing itself, but I submit that in this and in other subjects it is apt to be dangerous and misleading to go outside the authentic organ of public opinion&#x2014;namely, its expression in the Commons House of Parliament. To what is this public support due? It is due, I suggest, to the facts of the case. In Scotland, as in England, a very small proportion of the population live in the rural districts&#x2014;about a quarter&#x2014;and this proportion is growing smaller and smaller every year. Nothing has influenced public opinion more strongly on this subject than the appearance of the Census figures this year, and if your Lordships will allow me I will mention one or two salient facts which the Census discloses. In the first; place, it shows that during the decade which has just ended we have had in Scotland the lowest rate of increase since 1861&#x2014;namely, 6&#x00B7;4. The increase in the preceding decade was 11&#x00B7;1. We have had, it is true, a total increase of population of 287,000, but the natural increase&#x2014;that is to say, the excess of births over deaths&#x2014;is something like 542,000, so that we have really a loss of population of. 255,000. Of the thirty-three counties in Scotland sixteen show a decrease of population, and in two others the increase is under 100. Of the total number of 875 parishes in Scotland, in no less than 536 there is an absolute decrease in population. Fifteen counties have fewer inhabitants than they had fifty years ago, and four counties have fewer inhabitants than they had in the year 1801, when the population of Scotland was not very much more than 1,600,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01155"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord name those counties?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01156"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: They are Argyll, Berwick, Perth, and Sutherland. There are 205 burghs m Scotland&#x2014;the dwindling of the country population affects the small country towns&#x2014;and in seventy-six of these, mostly small burghs, there are fewer inhabitants now than there were ten years ago. Then, again, the emigration figures for Scotland are alarming. We have hitherto been accustomed to regard Ireland as that portion of the United Kingdom which contributed most to emi-
<col>296</col>
gration, but that state of things has been reversed for the last, five years. Scotland contributes about 11 per cent, to the total population of the United Kingdom, but it contributes 25 per cent, to the emigration figures. For the last five years the emigration from Scotland has exceeded the emigration from Ireland by 17,000 people, and during the last ten years there has been a progressive increase in the emigration from Scotland. The figure ten years ago was 8,970; last year the record figure of 58,384 was reached. Then if you look at the agricultural condition of Scotland you will see that Scotland has shared in the loss of arable land; arable land has gone out of cultivation, and it is said that arable land does not pay. I submit to your Lordships that arable land does pay but requires expert fanning to make it pay, and we have to face the fact that unless there is more arable land the land will not support a larger rural population. It is in this connection noteworthy that while our land has been going out of cultivation, in other countries large additions have been made to the arable land.<lb/>
Again, there are fewer people in Scotland actively engaged in agriculture in proportion to our population than in other agricultural and progressive countries. Every year a larger area in Scotland is devoted to deer forests and to sport. I am not attacking sport or deer forests. I wish to guard myself against any such inference. There is some land, no doubt, suited to such purposes, and probably a greater proportion of land would be taken from sheep farms than from deer forests if it were devoted to the purposes which I have indicated. At the same time it must surely be disquieting to realise the very large increase in the area devoted exclusively to sport in Scotland. In 1883, 1,700,000 acres were devoted to these purposes in the Highland counties. That figure is now very nearly 3,000,000 acres according to a return of 1908, and if we add some 500,000 acres devoted to this purpose in other counties in Scotland we arrive at a total of 3,500,000 acres. Scotland has fewer farms in proportion to her size and population than other agricultural countries. Denmark is half the size of Scotland; she has 230,000 farms, whilst Scotland has 90,000. Then, again, our agricultural labour is fast diminishing. There were 91,801 farm servants ten years
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0153"/>
<col>297</col>
ago; to-day there are 73,794. I have some figures here&#x2014;I hesitate to trouble your Lordships with them&#x2014;which contrast the condition of Belgium with Scotland. They have been very carefully examined. But I will content myself with mentioning that many comparisons have been drawn, after a very careful examination of the circumstances, which confirm the apprehensions I have already indicated.<lb/>
At any rate, my Lords, public opinion in Scotland is strongly convinced that we are not making the most of our resources, that our land is not supporting the population which it might support, and that it is not producing what it might produce. Scotland is renowned in some branches of farming, but, whatever be their merits or importance, the system of farming and land tenure in Scotland is not succeeding in keeping the people on the land. It does not offer adequate inducements to the man who works on it, and if we are to meet this need, which is a national and more than a purely agricultural need, the inducements must be increased, and we must make it possible for men in larger numbers to make a home and a career on the land in Scotland and reap the fruits of their own labour, as is the case elsewhere in the British Empire. These facts were bound, I submit, to influence public opinion, and it was not surprising to the Government that when a private Member in the House of Commons secured a place in the ballot he introduced the Government measure of 1908 as his own measure and obtained a Second Reading for it without a Division. The Bill went upstairs to Grand Committee, and much conference and consultation took place between the opposite sides of the House. There was an evident desire to endeavour to meet differences and to bridge over difficulties, and the Bill emerged from the Grand Committee with considerable changes and concessions.<lb/>
It may be convenient to your Lordships if I endeavour very briefly to explain the provisions of the Bill as it now stands. As I have said, it seeks, first, to give a permanent tenure to existing small holdings and to so maintain their existence as small holdings; secondly, to create new small holdings, in order to offer a career to those who work on the land and to increase the number of small farmers. Your Lordships know that what we mean in Scotland
<col>298</col>
by a small holding is somewhat different from what, is commonly, I think, characterised as a small holding in England. We mean a small farm upon which a man and his family can make a living, and not simply a piece of ground which he can cultivate in connection with his existing dwelling-house. One feature, I submit, of all systems which have been established to encourage small holdings is that they have provided security of tenure. In Ireland this was done by the Ulster custom of tenant right, and subsequently by the peasant proprietary set up by more recent legislation. In England, in the Act of 1907, which your Lordships examined and debated, security of tenure is provided by the system of county council leases for the duration of thirty years, with powers, if not probabilities, of extension beyond that time. The reason is, of course, that without such security the stimulus to exertion is not present. Let a man reap the whole fruits of his labour and he will put forth the utmost of his exertions, his mental activity will be greater, and he will seek to co-operate with his neighbours and benefit by such opportunities in the way of agricultural education as the Government may offer him. The security which is offered by this Bill is not the Ulster system, nor peasant proprietary, nor the county council system. It differs from all these. It is founded on the tenure of the Crofters Act of 1886, of which we have had in Scotland five-and-twenty years experience. It is familiar and appreciated in Scotland, and under it great improvements have taken place.<lb/>
This Bill gives to the crofter, who is under the Bill called a landholder, security of tenure, subject to conditions protecting the interests of the landlord, such as providing against the deterioration of the soil, the dilapidation of buildings, and other matters of the same kind. Subject to these, the landholder may remain on his farm as long as he likes and have the right to bequeath his interest in it. He will have to pay a fair rent, and he has the right of having that rent fixed by an independent and impartial tribunal. When he leaves the farm, he has the right to compensation from the landlord for such improvements as the tenant himself has put up, so long as they are deemed by the Land Court suitable to the holding. When this proposal was last discussed by this House it
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0154"/>
<col>299</col>
was characterised by the noble Marquess opposite and others who criticised as the crofterisation of the Lowlands. I think that was the centre and core of their criticism. Strong objection was taken to it chiefly on this ground, that, apart altogether from the expediency of the policy, it was unfair to give this tenure to tenants who had not, like the crofters, made their own improvements. To do so, it was argued, would be to hand over to such tenants improvements which had been made at the cost of the landlord. It is just at this point that an important change has been made in the Bill. After much conference and discussion between both sides of the House common ground on this point has been found, and effect has been given to the distinction drawn between tenants who have and tenants who have not made their own improvements. Tenants who have made their own improvements, or the greater part of them, are to remain under the original tenure of the Bill as I have described it, and are termed landholders. On the other hand, for those who have not made their own improvements a separate Code has been drawn up, to which allusion is made in Clause 2 of the Bill, and which will be found <i>in extensor</i> in Clause 32. In both those clauses such tenants are described as "statutory small tenants," in contradistinction to landholders.<lb/>
These statutory small tenants remain under the conditions of their existing agreement or lease; and, except when the landlord satisfies the Land Court that there is reasonable ground of objection to the statutory small tenant, that tenant is entitled by the provisions of this Bill to a renewal of his lease when it comes to an end. The landlord and tenant may, of course, agree as to the terms and conditions of the lease or of the renewal. Failing agreement, the landlord or the tenant may apply to the Land Court to fix an equitable rent and to fix the period for which the agreement or the tenancy is to be renewed. In determining the rent the words of the clause are, I think, fairly precise, and I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to them. They are to be found in subsection (8) of Clause 32, which runs thus&#x2014;
<quote>"In determining the vent the Land Court shall, so far as practicable, act on their own knowledge and experience, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, holding, and district,
<col>300</col>
including the rent at which the holding has been let, the proposed conditions of the renewed tenacy, the improvements made by the landlord and tenant respectively, and the then condition and value of such improvements; and&#x2014;</quote>
these are the important words which were arrived at only after considerable conference and discussion&#x2014;
<quote>"and shall fix as the rent to be paid by the tenant the rent which, in their opinion, would be an equitable rent for the holding between the landlord and the tenant as a willing lessor and a willing lessee."</quote>
One further condition of this Code I would point out&#x2014;namely, that in the event of the landlord at any time failing to provide or maintain the buildings and permanent improvements suitable to the holding, the tenant may apply to the Land Court, who may, after hearing the parties, declare that the tenant shall become a landholder and so pass into the other category of these small tenants and have the rights of a landholder under the Bill. This arrangement has so far been accepted as a satisfactory solution of this which your Lordships will remember was one of the most controversial points in the earlier discussions of this Bill.<lb/>
I do not suggest in saying this&#x2014;I wish to guard myself against saying it&#x2014;that the Bill comes up to your Lordships in any sense as an agreed Bill. Your Lordships are probably as well acquainted as I am with what did take place in the House of Commons. It is true to say that both parties have done their best to meet each others difficulties in this matter and in other points of the Bill, and it is after that has been done, and in view of the better hope which there is for this Bill under such circumstance, that the Bill has now come to your Lordships' House. The House will observe that in describing the tribunal which fixes a fair rent I have called it the Land Court. Hitherto in the Highland counties the Crofters Commission has discharged the duty of fixing fair rents and the other duties prescribed under the Crofters Act, 1886. Obviously the existence of two bodies discharging similar duties is not necessary. Accordingly the Crofters Commission is by this Bill brought to an end and merged into the larger body for the whole of Scotland. The <i>status</i> of the Court and of its chairman is raised. It is to consist of not more than five members. Such administrative functions as the Crofters Commission has hitherto had have been taken away. Those ad-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0155"/>
<col>301</col>
ministrative functions have been reduced to a minimum, and it may, I think, be correctly said that the functions of the Land Court are strictly judicial. So much for the first part of the Bill.<lb/>
I will now say a few words about the next purpose of the Bill, which is to create now holdings. Again here we have experience of this kind in Scotland. True, that experience is confined to the Highlands, but for all that it is not to be despised in the consideration of the very difficult work of creating new small holdings. In 1897 Parliament established the Congested Districts Board. Its duties are somewhat varied, but it performs the duties of a Board of Agriculture for the crofter counties. It spends money in improving live stock and in work of that kind, and it has, besides, powers for the purchase of land for re-sale to tenants, and it has also carried out schemes for the settlement of tenants upon land as crofters under the Crofters Act. During its existence it has created over 600 small holdings and carried out more than 1,000 cases of enlargement of existing holdings. This Bill proposes to extend these powers, which are wholly administrative, to the whole of Scotland. But the Congested Districts Board disappears and is superseded in the exercise of these powers by the Board of Agriculture, which is constituted, by Clause 4 of this Bill. I shall say something later about the general administrative powers of this proposed Board, but I mention it now for the reason that its powers come into play in the machinery which the Bill proposes to set up for the creation of small holdings.<lb/>
As your Lordships well know, land cannot be made available for the creation of small holdings without the erection of new buildings. Frequently, if not always, the cost of new buildings is fatal and prohibitive to schemes for small holdings. That may not be universally the case, because the increased rental which may come from land may in certain cases meet, wholly or partly, the cost of the erection of new building's, but this question of new buildings has been a great obstacle to the breaking up of land for small holdings. Clause 7 of this Bill, and especially subsection (7) of that clause, is designed to meet this difficulty. It offers financial help, on the one hand, by grants or loans for fencing, dividing, and adapting land, for providing water supply, and other
<col>302</col>
purposes; and, on the other hand, it offers loans for the provision of farmhouses and buildings. Both these provisions are founded upon the practice which has been followed hitherto by the Congested Districts Board in schemes of this character. The same clause contains the procedure which is to be followed in preparing schemes of small holdings. And let me say here, my Lords, that there it, nothing whatever in this Bill restricting or preventing the existing freedom of any landlord to make small holdings on his own property under whatever system he chooses.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0010P0I0156"/>
<col>303</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01167"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Lord's pardon for having interrupted him. But he made a statement in which he said that there was no interference with the liberty of landowners to create new small holdings on their property with their own money, and my interruption was caused by the fact that I did not see anything in the Bill which gave that power. Therefore I asked where the provision was.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01168"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think the answer I have given is perfectly correct, but I will undertake to give a definite answer before the debate concludes. But, as a matter of fact, taking the operation of this clause which provides the machinery for the creation of small holdings, such holdings may, of course, be created by agreement between landlord and tenant. Secondly, the clause provides that the machinery of the clause shall be set in motion by the Commissioner for Small Holdings. Your Lordships will observe in subsection (2) of the clause that it is the duty of the Commissioner for Small Holdings to report from time to time what demands for small holdings exist and what land is available. His next step is to negotiate with the landlord of such land, and he then reports to his Board, who draw up the scheme. With the Commissioner for Small Holdings they decide what financial help they can offer to the scheme and what compensation is due to the interests affected, and if there is no difference of opinion the scheme proceeds; but should there be a difference of opinion there is a provision to meet it in the clause. For instance, the landlord may decline to negotiate, there may be differences of opinion among applicants which prevent an agreement, and so forth. If the Board, in those circumstances, feel obliged to proceed with the scheme, it becomes a compulsory scheme. Then the Board of Agriculture, after hearing all the parties, give due notice, and intimate to all concerned that the scheme is to proceed, if at all, as a compulsory scheme. They frame the scheme in all details and give notice that they propose to lay it before the Land Court. The scheme then goes before the Land Court, and the Court gives the parties an opportunity to be heard upon it, and, after hearing all parties as between the Board on the one hand and the landlord or other interests on the other, the Court decides what land may be taken, what is to be the fair rent for each holding, what land
<col>304</col>
is to be excluded from the scheme, and, indeed, whatever else is necessary to adjust the scheme.<lb/>
Further, if in the opinion of the Land Court&#x2014;and this is the provision for compensation which your Lordships will find in subsection (11) of Clause 7&#x2014;damage will be done to the letting value of the land or to any farm, or, indeed, to any estate, or to a landlord in respect of an obligation to take over sheep stock and so forth, the Court may require the Board of Agriculture to give compensation to the interests concerned, provided always that the damage done is directly attributable to the constitution of new holdings. The Bill provides that the scheme shall be the scheme of the Board of Agriculture; that any differences between that Board and the landlord shall be submitted to and determined by the Land Court as a skilled, impartial, and independent tribunal; that the parties shall be heard, and that the decision of the Land Court shall be final; and that, in the event of the scheme proceeding, full and fair compensation, as awarded by the Land Court, shall be paid to all interests affected. I submit, my Lords, that under such a system as this the provision for compensation is a most important consideration. On the one hand, it is the view of the Government that compensation should be fair and full in every particular; on the other hand, the effect of such compensation will, as your Lordships will readily see, be to check unwise or extravagant schemes. They will be shown to be impracticable, and schemes which are launched will have behind them the probability, if not the certainty, of success.<lb/>
But it may fairly be said, "This is all very well. You are going to take this land, break it up for small holdings and pay compensation and settle the tenants upon it. What if the scheme is a failure, and the small holdings which have been forced upon an unwilling landlord are thrown back on his hands?" That contingency, remote as I trust it may be, is met by the Bill. The proviso to Clause 17 provides that in such a case where the damage is attributable to the constitution of small holdings the landlord may apply to the Land Court to assess the damage or injury done by the scheme and require the Board to pay to him such compensation as the Land Court may determine. Before
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0157"/>
<col>305</col>
I pass from that point I have only to repeat what has been said in another place on behalf of the Government, that if your Lordships can show that there are any risks unprovided for, any losses unforeseen, which will inevitably occur to the landlord or other interests in this matter, the Government will be glad to consider any proposals that can be made to remedy such omissions.<lb/>
It is urged that these proposals constitute an unwarrantable interference with existing rights, and also that a system of dual ownership is set up by the Bill. We have frequently heard those arguments. There is a partnership set up by the Bill as there must be under any system of landlord and tenant; but I submit that this system which exists and which is strengthened and maintained by this Bill does not in principle differ from the partnerships constituted by the Agricultural Holdings Acts. If a larger population is to be placed on the land the economic position of existing small holdings must be strengthened, new small holdings must be made, and greater inducements must be offered. The only basis for such efforts is complete security of tenure. Purchase offers security of tenure, and the Small Holdings Act of 1892, which confers upon county councils powers by purchase to provide small holdings, is unimpaired by this Bill. But there is every indication, my Lords, that public opinion in Scotland, as well as in this country, will not have purchase. The evidence and the experience of the English Act of 1907 are very striking upon this point. Not 2&#x00BD; per cent, of the 30,000 applications for land under that Act have been applications for purchase. That surely indicates that while purchase may be suitable in special cases and for special purposes&#x2014;and I, for one, have never denied that&#x2014;it is not suitable to, and is not demanded and is not likely to be taken advantage of by the great body of those who seek to improve their position on the land. The proposals in this Bill are intended to provide complete security of tenure with the least possible burden and the least possible interference with the existing system. The landlord may still sell, mortgage, bequeath his land, or dispose of it as he may think lit. He may shoot, he may fish, he may hunt, he may plant, he may dig for minerals, he may resume for building, he may feu his estate&#x2014;none of these powers are in any way restricted or impaired by this Bill.
<col>306</col>
All that the Bill lays down is that so long as the land is let to small holders the small holder shall have security of tenure to do the best for himself and his family and for the country.<lb/>
The third portion of the Bill, as to which I will only say a very few words, is the proposal to appoint a separate Board of Agriculture for Scotland, which is to consist of three members, one of whom is to be the chairman and another the Commissioner for Small Holdings. The Board of Agriculture is to exercise its powers over all Scotland. It is to take over from the Congested Districts Board the powers which that Board has for promoting small holdings and for the aiding and developing of agriculture and dairying, the improvement of live stock, and the encouragement of home industries. Under Clause 4 of the Bill the Board is directly charged with the duty of promoting the interests of agriculture, forestry, and other rural industries, and in the same clause provision is made for the transfer from the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in London of powers which apply to Scotland. The most important of those powers, so far as they apply to Scotland, is the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, and I would ask your Lordships to note that in that clause it is provided that these powers may be transferred cither unconditionally or subject to conditions. I do not propose to argue this point on the present occasion. It seems to be more suitable for discussion in Committee. But I should just like to say that the Government are entirely alive and agreed as to the importance of eradicating disease and protecting the herds and flocks of this country from disease.<lb/>
This proposal has always been in the Bill. It was not inserted except after very full consideration and examination of the facts. It is held, that what is proposed is likely to confer greater protection and to be more prompt and effective than the present system, because the Scottish Board would be more accessible to public opinion, would have a more intimate knowledge of local conditions, and a greater opportunity of continuous vigilance over conditions which are likely to harbour disease. I may point out that this provision has nothing whatever to do with the question of the importation of Canadian cattle. That question is regulated
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0158"/>
<col>307</col>
by Statute, and nothing can be done to alter the present position except with, the consent of Parliament. I am quite aware that there are apprehensions&#x2014;perfectly honest and genuine apprehensions&#x2014;on this subject. For myself, I confess I have no such apprehensions. I believe that the two Boards could act perfectly well together in this matter, and as an example I may remind your Lordships that in regard to the subject of epidemic infectious disease the Local Government Boards of the two countries work perfectly harmoniously and effectively together. There was an outbreak of plague the other day in Suffolk, but there was no nervousness in Scotland. Years of experience have quite satisfied us in Scotland that every precaution is taken by our own Local Government Board, acting in conjunction with the Local Government Board here. But I understand that proposals may be made in Committee to amend the Bill in this matter, and I can only say that the Government will be glad to give their best consideration to those proposals.<lb/>
May I, before I sit down, say a word to explain why the Government attach vital importance to the establishment of this separate Board of Agriculture for Scotland? In the first place, the soil and climate, the laws and institutions and local authorities, the system of land tenure, the system of education&#x2014;all these, which have an intimate bearing on the agriculture of the country, are different in Scotland from what they are in England. Secondly, the working of this Bill makes it imperative that there should be Scottish authorities to carry it out. I cannot conceive any Government making the proposal that the Crofters Commission or the Congested Districts Board should be worked from London rather than in Scotland, and the argument becomes all the stronger when these two authorities become authorities for the whole of Scotland. After all, agriculture is essentially a local industry. It is bound up intimately with the lives and the homes of the people, and if Scottish farmers are to be equipped as they should be to compete with their rivals, they should have the same help as their rivals have.<lb/>
Every progressive agricultural country has not only remodelled its land tenure, but has provided its farmers with an active and energetic stimulus to their industry in the shape of a Department of
<col>308</col>
Agriculture. Look even across St. George's Channel and see what the Irish Department has done for Ireland. Unquestionably we are being left behind by the activity, the energy, and the success of the Irish Department in its development of the agricultural industries of Ireland. Take one of the very smallest of those industries, one which here is reckoned as one of the very smallest&#x2014;the poultry industry. In five years in Ireland the value of the export of eggs and poultry has increased from &#x00A3;2,800,000 to &#x00A3;3,700,000. Nearly &#x00A3;1,000,000 has in the last five years been added to the exports from Ireland in this one branch, and it has been done by active work on the part of the Department in the provision of trained teachers, poultry schools, and instruction in the scientific care of poultry, the selection of birds, and so forth. It is just such facilities applied to every branch of agriculture that we desire to place at the disposal of Scottish farmers&#x2014;facilities for education, for research and experiment, and for protection from fraudulent imitations which interfere with the sale of the genuine article.<lb/>
Then in Scotland we have a claim to special treatment in this matter in the existence of very large opportunities for forestry which are common to no other part of the United Kingdom. And, finally, I would submit that the problem is not merely agricultural; it is social. There is real decay in country life, and depopulation is depriving the country districts of the enjoyment in full measure of the ordinary resources of civilisation. It is becoming harder and harder in Scotland to equip rural districts adequately with medical attendance and even with facilities for education. The burden is getting more and more onerous and more and more difficult to compass. And this vital and unavoidable obligation of endeavouring to recreate the rural life of the country cannot be undertaken unless every instrument is placed at the disposal of the people and of the Government. It can only be based on the independence of the people. The dwellers in the country must be allowed to strike their roots into the soil, and no longer be dependent on the will of any man for their home and livelihood. Therefore, in the view of the Government, there must be a Scottish Department to be the servant of Scottish agriculture and to work alongside other Scottish
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0159"/>
<col>309</col>
Departments hand in hand for the purpose of enabling the land of Scotland to support a larger population and to make it more productive, to improve the methods of farming, to organise the farming industry, and to promote the industries which are auxiliary to farming, and so to raise and enrich the home life of the people who live in the country districts.<lb/>
The whole country is interested in this proposal. It is not a matter of interest solely to rural districts; it is of interest to the towns. The present arrangements in regard to the Board of Agriculture&#x2014;and in saying this I make no criticism of and no complaint against the Board of Agriculture in London and its officials who have carried on their work with the greatest zeal and energy, only under the great difficulty of being at a distance&#x2014;the present arrangements are condemned by everybody. Everybody asks for a change. They do not all ask for the change which is proposed in this Bill, but then there are always critics and the world is not a perfect world. The Government feel that in this matter they will not be doing their duty if they do not press upon Parliament with all their strength the proposals which are contained in this Bill. I thank your Lordships very warmly for your courtesy in allowing me to explain the. Bill at such length, and I hope I have not unduly trespassed upon your time. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01169">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Pentland.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01170"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with the greatest possible interest to the exhaustive speech which the noble Lord has made explaining the provisions of this Bill, and I am sure I shall carry the sense of the House with me when I say that a fairer or more conciliatory speech could not have been made upon the subject. But whether he has convinced your Lordships that all the provisions of this Bill are the best possible provisions that can be imagined for the purpose which he has in hand is a matter upon which I have still grave doubts. The noble Lord began his speech by saying that the Bill was intended to accomplish three purposes. It was a Land Tenure Bill, it was a Bill for the creation of small holdings, and a Bill for instituting a Board of Agriculture for Scotland. So far as it is
<col>310</col>
a Land Tenure Bill&#x2014;in other words, so far as it is purely a proposal to amend the Crofters' Holdings Act for those who are in the strict sense of the term crofters&#x2014;I have little to say; but I still do not understand why, because you want more small holdings in Scotland, you are to unsettle every agricultural tenure in that country. The Bill does that, and it implies more.<lb/>
The noble Lord said that since this matter had been last discussed opinions had advanced. I altogether deny that there has ever been any doubt here in this House, especially on this side, as to the advantage of a certain proportion of small holdings. But when the noble Lord goes on to point out, as a reason for the provisions of this Bill, that the rural population of Scotland has diminished and is diminishing, I am bound to say that if he intends to imply that that is even more than remotely connected with the question of tenure, he is entirely mistaken. He instanced four counties&#x2014;your Lordships will remember that I asked for the names of those counties&#x2014;as those that were the most terrible examples of the particular point which he was urging on the House at the moment. Those counties were Argyll, Berwick, Perth, and Sutherland. Well, Argyll and Sutherland are crofting counties. They already have this very security of tenure which is now asked for, and yet the population is diminishing. That clearly shows that uncertainty of tenure is not the main cause of the diminution of population.<lb/>
Then take Perth and Berwick. Perth and Berwick happen to be two agricultural counties which are almost without any manufacturing town of any kind within them, and therefore the movement of the population to other parts of Scotland takes them out of the totals for those counties which are returned in the Census. To follow that up for a moment, the point of arable land going out of cultivation depends far more on other things besides tenure. It depends mainly upon prices. It is because the price of agricultural products has fallen during the last half century that this migration from the country to the town has gone on, and it will continue to go on unless prices rise&#x2014;but this is a very large question into which I am not now going to enter. There is another cause which, has handicapped
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0160"/>
<col>311</col>
agriculture in Scotland, and that is the continually increasing pressure and tyranny of what is put upon the rates which agricultural land has so largely to bear. It is these two factors taken together, the fall of prices and the burden of the rates, which have largely caused this migration of population.<lb/>
Then as regards the proposal to establish a Board of Agriculture in Scotland. There I do not think opinion has advanced. The noble Lord said something about agriculturists not being largely represented in the other House of Parliament because they were, comparatively speaking, small in numbers and could not make the weight of their opinion felt. But if you take agricultural opinion, which I agree is not largely represented in the other House&#x2014;if you take agricultural opinion as expressed through its own constituted bodies you will find that at a meeting held some few weeks ago at Perth, at which 14,000 agriculturists were represented and at which 120 delegates were present, there was not one single person to be found who would support the proposals in this Bill. There were two different proposals put forward. One was for a Board of Agriculture on the lines of the present Board of Agriculture but more representative of Scotland, and the other was for something like the Bill but not the proposal in the Bill: but the voting was 86 to 44. Neither of the resolutions before the chamber had the remotest connection to the proposals in this Bill; they were both for very radical changes in the particular proposals put forward in this Bill.<lb/>
I shall not detain the House longer than I can help, because I, for one, am certainly not going to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. But I cannot even now understand why, because you want small holdings in Scotland, you must necessarily combine that with most radical changes in the whole of our agricultural tenure. This Bill is still in name a Bill to amend the Crofters Holdings Act; yet except by exception it really extends the principles of crofting tenure throughout the whole of Scotland. There is no case for that at all. The history of the crofting tenure makes it suitable to its own district; but it has nothing on earth to do with the general agricultural condition of Scotland. This Bill seeks to introduce both the system and the principles which were the
<col>312</col>
ruin of Irish agriculture. The real logical division between one form of tenure and another is not the size or the situation of the holding. The critical thing is, Who does the improvements? If the landlord has allowed his tenant, either by custom or bargain or otherwise, to put up buildings, to roof houses, to do the class of permanent improvements apart from the rent, no fair-minded man can deny that he has allowed the tenant to create for himself an interest in the holding for which he should be compensated. But I cannot see the remotest justice, in the case in which the landlord has done the whole of the permanent improvements, that the tenant is to be given any more interest than that for which he has bargained. There is no case for it, as far as I can see, in the circumstances of Scotland. As I have said, the logical, fair, practical, sensible criterion is, Who has done the permanent improvements? If the tenant has done them, I say again he has acquired an interest for which he should be compensated; but, so far as I know, that is not the case over the largest area in Scotland.<lb/>
I understand the expressions "landlord," "tenant," and "smallholder." But just look what complicated phraseology we have throughout the Bill. I would take as an illustration subsection (10) of Clause 26. With all the intelligence which I have been able to devote to it and with all the explanation I have been able to get, I am still wholly unable to fathom what is the meaning of that subsection. You there find this provision&#x2014;
<quote>"A person shall not be subject to the provisions of this Act regarding statutory small tenants who in terms of this section would be disqualified from being an existing yearly tenant or a qualified leaseholder."</quote>
You have to wade through crofters, landholders with leases, landholders without leases, statutory small tenants, existing yearly tenants, and qualified leaseholders. I venture to say if there ever was a Bill introduced into Parliament with complicated phraseology this is one which beats anything I have ever seen.<lb/>
And when I say that this Bill seems to threaten to revolutionise tenure all over Scotland, I have the authority of the Lord Advocate for that statement. The provision of the Bill to which for the moment I am calling attention is the one which says
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0161"/>
<col>313</col>
that if there is a holder whoso holding is under &#x00A3;50 in annual value and under 50 acres he is to become, whatever his bargain with the landlord, a statutory small tenant. There is no logic in the limit of &#x00A3;50 in the case of value or of 50 acres in regard to size; and I will read what the Lord Advocate said in the other House when this point was put to him. He was asked why, if security of tenure was necessary, it should be limited to holdings of 50 acres, and he replied&#x2014;
<quote>"It was because it was thought that small farmers alone desired to have this benefit. He readily admitted that there was no logical defence. Whenever large farmers intimated a desire to have security of tenure and fair rent, they should have it. The House could not deny it."</quote>
The question I ask is, Is that or is that not a fair expression of the policy of the Government? Do they mean to carry on through all the sizes of agricultural holdings this principle that if a man who has bargained for a lease for a term of years desires to have it extended he is to have it regardless of the interests or the rights or the privileges of the landlord? That is why I say that this departure from the criterion of the man who has done the improvements is, to my mind, a fatal blot upon this Bill. I agree&#x2014;and I say it because we are so often misrepresented&#x2014;that if the tenant has done the improvements, by all means acknowledge it and compensate him and give him a fair return for it; but if you once depart from the principle that you can get possession of the property by doing the improvements yourself, you have taken the first and fatal step into all the difficulties which will land you in the Irish land system, of which we have heard so much in this House.<lb/>
I stand on this principle, that there is neither fairness nor reason in taking away the right of the landlord who has honestly done his duty to his estate and has done the improvements. This Bill disregards that condition, and it gives to the tenant two things. It gives him fixity of tenure subject to the landlord having to prove something against his tenure, and it gives it to him subject to a rent being fixed by an outside authority. I say there is no fairness in that in the case of a farm any more than there is in the case of a house. If I let a house to anybody, I expect to get it back at the end of the lease. If I let a farm to a tenant, I expect to get, that farm back at the end of the
<col>314</col>
lease. And I say, with all the force that I can, that if you once depart from that principle you have taken a fatal step which you will never cease to regret.<lb/>
The noble Lord spent some time in explaining to us the method by which small holdings were to be formed. First, there was to be agreement, as to which no one can take any exception. Secondly, there was to be compulsion in the case where there was not agreement. I at any rate am not going to take any exception to that where it is proved that public necessity requires it. But I think the procedure is rather complicated. There is, first, to be a report by the Commissioner; there is then to be a decision by the Board of Agriculture; and then there is a power to the Land Court to take, and also a power to assess the damage after hearing the parties concerned. I frankly admit that the conditions as laid down in the Bill and as explained by the noble Lord are fair. But, my Lords, it is not so much the paper conditions that I am concerned with, but the guarantees for carrying these out with fairness in practice. The value is to be taken, but the value to whom? Is the piece taken out of the farm to be valued according to its value to the person who now has it, or according to its value to the person who is to get it? It may be very different; and everything depends, not upon the conditions which are laid down in the Bill, important as they are, but upon the method in which they are carried out. You have this Board of Agriculture and the Land Court acting together. They have every temptation put in their way to make the thing a success. They naturally wish that their work should be successful, and it may be even said that their bias in this direction is a laudable bias. But in order to keep down the compensation to be paid to the landlord for depreciation in the letting value of his farm, they have only to fix the abatement to be given to the tenant at a very low figure. In view of this, they may be tempted to allow an abatement for the land taken equal only to the rent by which the holding will be diminished.<lb/>
And there is an extraordinary difficulty in assessing the real damage to a farm in taking a slice out of it. It is a thing upon which opinions vary in the most extraordinary way; and I think I can prove, from practical experience under
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0162"/>
<col>315</col>
the working of the present Government, that the value to the small holder, to a congregation of small holders, is much less than the value to a single tenant. The noble Lord opposite will remember the case of Vatersay. Vatersay as one farm was let at &#x00A3;300 a year to a substantial tenant; it was purchased by the Congested Districts Board, and when subdivided only produced &#x00A3;160 a year. In the case of that happening under a holding taken under this Bill, who is to bear that loss? Is it to be the landlord from whom the land is taken, or is he to be compensated? I ask that matters of this kind should not be left entirely to the opinion of those who are interested in making the procedure a success. The Commissioners are to say which land they want, and the Court is to have the power of taking it. It does seem to me that from the decision of the Land Court as to the value three must be an appeal of some kind. It does not appear to me to matter so much whether it is an appeal to a skilled arbitrator or to a higher tribunal, but the mere existence of the possibility of there being an appeal, the mere fact that the Court which comes to the decision knows that that decision can be appealed against, is a guarantee that they will not do an outrageous or unfair thing. But if they are in the position of doing as they choose without having to justify their decision, then I say we are put under a condition under which I will not willingly go.<lb/>
Something was said of the high position in which the Land Court is to be placed. In Clause 3 there is a provision that the Chairman is to have what is called the rank of a Judge. Now what does that mean? I always thought that rank was a thing which was given by the Sovereign. I have never heard of this being given by Act of Parliament. You may give a man the rank of a Judge, but you do not thereby give him the ability or the fairness of a Judge. You may take a man out of the street and give him the rank of Lord Chancellor, but by that means you do not make him fit to preside over the Court of Appeal. This gentleman who is to have the rank of a Judge is to receive &#x00A3;2,000 a year, and to be removable by the Secretary of State for inability or misbehaviour. He is not to have the security of tenure of a Judge; therefore what security is it that he is to have the rank of a Judge? Is he to be called
<col>316</col>
Lord So-and-so, and is his wife to be called Lady So-and-so; and will that cease if he is removed on account of inability or misbehaviour? Of all the provisions I have come across in a Bill about a Court, the statement that a person is to have the rank of a Judge seems to me the most ludicrous and absurd I have seen in print. Then why are existing leases to be interfered with? The date of 1906 in Clause 7 still remains. People have made bargains for leases in the last five years, and it seems to me that 1906 should become 1911. That, however, is a comparatively small point, and may stand over until we reach the next stage.<lb/>
I was surprised at the lightheartedness with which the Secretary for Scotland passed over the provisions establishing the new Board of Agriculture. I cannot conceive a matter in which a greater number of interests are concerned. It seems to me you must look at it from many points of view. The mere question of the Diseases of Animals Act is not a very large one; it is not, comparatively speaking, by any means the largest of them; but that we should have a proper system for repressing these diseases is of the greatest importance to agriculture and to the country generally. This, at any rate, is a matter in which there is no conflict of opinion as between England and Scotland. The success of your administration depends upon the solidarity of the two countries in the doing of it, and, if I may venture to say so, on the uniformity of administration. It is that uniformity of administration which has secured the confidence both at home and abroad which is so valuable an asset in this matter. In old days every local authority had power to make its own regulations, with the result that these diseases were rampant, and the loss to agriculture and the community generally was very large. Now it is known everywhere that the strictest regulations are enforced, and consequently our cattle, especially pedigree stock, are exported to foreign countries with the greatest freedom and without difficulty. If you once begin to draw a line between England and Scotland you give up the advantage of our insular position with all that it means. The sea is the barrier which you must maintain. But for some sort of national reason, apparently to pander to national feeling&#x2014;[LORD PENTLAND: No, no]&#x2014;we are to have differences
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0163"/>
<col>317</col>
between England and Scotland. May I ask whether Wales is to be brought in in the same way? Is there to be a large land frontier for these diseases between Wales and England? If not, why not?<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord that I should never for a moment think of bringing the administration of the Congested Districts Board to London, but that Board only deals with a comparatively small area in Scotland&#x2014;I will not say an unimportant, but a comparatively small area&#x2014;and the circumstances of agriculture over the greater part of Scotland are much more in touch with English agriculture than with the Congested Districts Board and its work. Therefore I look with, the greatest suspicion upon the separation of the agricultural administration of the Lowlands of Scotland from the Board of Agriculture in London even in matters of that class. But so far as the administration of the Contagious Diseases Act is concerned it seems to me one of the most foolish steps which have ever been suggested. What is the theory upon which the Scottish Office was started? The Scottish Office was formed to deal with whatever is national or peculiar to Scotland: its system of education, its local government, its legal system, its poor-law, its fisheries, and so on. In these matters the powers of the Home Office were divided. A great deal that formerly belonged to the Home Office, and was administered for Scotland by the Home Office, was transferred to Dover House. But such things as factories and mines were not transferred, because here you could not tolerate the smallest differences of administration, and because it is absolutely necessary to keep the administration in Scotland and in England on those matters absolutely uniform. Then, with regard to the Board of Trade, such things as weights and measures were not transferred; and if you go through the whole list of Government Offices you will find that it is only in those things in which Scotland has special interests separate from England that administration is transferred.<lb/>
I venture to say, looking upon it from the agricultural point of view, that it would be a great mistake to make this transfer, and on this matter there is absolute unanimity on both sides of the Border. You will not find a single agricultural association that will pass a
<col>318</col>
resolution in favour of this Bill or anything like it. I have referred already to what passed at Perth on October 6. Last month, again, the North-Eastern Agricultural Federation, representing nine of the agricultural societies in the north of England, passed a resolution stating that the Federation&#x2014;
<quote>"urgently opposes the proposal to form a separate Board of Agriculture for Scotland, which would have the effect, of placing the administration of agriculture in Great Britain under two separate Departments, thus leading to unnecessary increase of officials and expense, to unnecessary confusion in carrying out Orders under the Contagions Diseases (Animals) Act, and to increased burdens on an already over-loaded industry."</quote>
In York, nine days later, the conference which met under the auspices of the Central Associated Chamber of Agriculture passed a resolution in practically the same terms.<lb/>
The weight of authority is also entirely on this side. You will hardly find an ex-President of the Board of Agriculture who will take the view that these provisions are wise. Mr. Walter Long has spoken eloquently on the subject in another place. Mr. Chaplin has done the same, and I dare say the noble Lord saw a very interesting, and to my mind convincing, letter by Lord Burghclere in <i>The Times</i> a few days ago. I will quote the words of one whom I think noble Lords opposite will agree is also a considerable authority&#x2014;Sir Edward Strachey, now Lord Strachie. Speaking a year or two ago at Perth when he was representing the Board of Agriculture at a Scottish conference, Sir Edward Strachey said&#x2014;
<quote>"Speaking as a Saxon I can say that I think, from an agricultural point of view, it would not be an advantage if the two countries were separated and the connecting link between English agriculturists and Scottish agriculturists was broken &#x2026; I am speaking purely from an agricultural point of view, leaving outside entirely, as I always do, political considerations."</quote>
Can we not here leave out political considerations and look at it purely as a matter of administration? I venture to say that if you take that line there can be but one opinion&#x2014;that this is a bad proposal.<lb/>
The importance of absolute uniformity on both sides of the Border is this, that there is a constant movement of stock of all kinds between England and Scotland. At certain times of the year thousands of sheep and quantities of fat cattle are
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0164"/>
<col>319</col>
brought from Scotland to England, and to some extent there is a movement in the opposite direction. I say, looking at it from a Scottish point of view, that the mere idea of giving power to an English Board to prohibit the importation into England of Scottish stock is one which fills me with alarm; but if you have a Board which is open to representations from both sides, which is bound to speak for both sides, which has the interests of both sides of the Border under its care, you get better, more sympathetic, and fairer consideration than if you allow any separation to be set up between them. I attach importance, in the interests of agriculture as a whole, to retaining the services of one man in the capacity to speak for the interests of agriculture. Agriculture has many things to contend with. I have alluded to the pressure of the rates. If there is one thing in the near future which is more desirable for reform than another it is this continual piling of burdens on agricultural land, and it is because I want to keep solidarity in the agricultural world that I desire to have somebody to speak for the combined interests of agriculture in a matter of that kind.<lb/>
But if you are going to do this and to do it by Statute once for all, do not put in the Bill such a clause as this&#x2014;that the Secretary for Scotland may do it by Order under his hand. How is the agriculturist to know how many Orders are passed and what are the real conditions of affairs? It is, of course, supposed that this Order is to be laid on the Table of Parliament, but even there the ordinary clause is not followed, for there in no provision that it is to be done during the session of Parliament. You may do it at any time when Parliament is not sitting and Parliament would have no power to protest. Why is a deliberate change made from the ordinary model form of the clause? It must either be absolute carelessness, or there must be something underlying it which we do not understand. It seems to me that this has been insufficiently considered, and I for one hope that the whole clause will be cut out when we reach the Committee, stage.<lb/>
Then look at the drafting of Clause 38. Did anybody ever have to deal with a clause drafted like that? It runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The Acts specified in the Schedule to this Act are hereby repealed to the extent mentioned in the third column&#x2014;</quote>
<col>320</col>
There are a whole batch of them; reference is made to half a dozen different Acts. But the clause does not stop there. It proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"and so much of any Act as is inconsistent with this Act is also hereby repealed."</quote>
Who is to be the judge of the inconsistency? It is not a mere matter of law; it is a matter of opinion. So much of any Act as is inconsistent with this Act&#x0021; It does seem to me that this is putting a burden upon us which we ought not to be expected to bear. So far as the general purpose of this Bill is concerned, so far as facilitating the creation of small holdings is concerned, I have nothing to say. But I do think that I am entitled to make this point, that in spite of what the noble Lord has said there remains in this Bill the original vice, that to set up a system of small holdings, which ought to be a simple and easy thing to do, you are undertaking what threatens, at any rate, to revolutionise the whole of agricultural tenure in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01171"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say that I was perfectly correct in the answer I gave just now, that this Bill does not impair the present freedom of a landlord to make small holdings by agreement with tenants of his own, on his own plan, and at his own expense without those holders necessarily becoming either landholders or statutory small tenants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01172"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: What would be the difference between the tenures?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01173"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The difference would be that one would be under the Bill and subject to Clause 32, and the other would not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01174"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: But by one clause in the Bill they could be put under.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01175"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01176"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord who introduced this Bill on the conciliatory spirit which he displayed, and if the same conciliatory spirit is carried to the Committee stage and there assumes a practical form, I believe that much good can be done to make the Bill more acceptable to all parties. There are certain blemishes in the Bill which lead many to seriously consider
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0165"/>
<col>321</col>
whether the evil of the Bill would not be greater to Scotland than the gain. The noble Lord stated that the increased interest in the question of small holdings dates from a comparatively recent time. I think that our beneficent interest in this Bill dates from the time when the noble Lord put down on paper the compensation clauses which had been promised by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and by other Ministers of importance.<lb/>
The noble Lord stated that he thought it would be dangerous for us to go outside the authentic exponents of public opinion in Scotland in coming to our decision on this question. I think we have a pretty strong case for going beyond the opinion of the Scottish Members of Parliament and searching outside for Scottish feeling on agricultural matters when we find that out of 150 farmers gathered together, Radical and Conservative, there was not one who held the views which the Scottish Members have placed in this Bill for a separate Board of Agriculture for Scotland. That is at any rate a <i>prima facie</i> justification for our not accepting holus-bolus any remedies that come from the Scottish Members in another place. I hope that this Bill will go through, not on its merits, because I do not think on the whole it is a well-conceived Bill, nor do I for a moment imagine that the millennium is going immediately to follow its passage, but it contains clauses which I should be very glad to see on the Statute Book. Certain crofter grievances in the north of Scotland will be done away with, and that security of tenure for small holders, which I believe to be a satisfactory tenure&#x2014;that which crofters at present enjoy&#x2014;will be extended to other parts of Scotland.<lb/>
That this security of tenure is likely to lead in the immediate future to a filling up of the soil and the stopping of the depopulation which is going on at the present moment in rural districts I very much doubt, because, as Lord Balfour clearly pointed out, the exodus from the Highland counties where the Crofters Act is in force is really greater than from the Lowland districts where it is not in force. But I do believe that security of tenure is at the bottom of any hope of maintaining the present number of smallholders on the soil, and therefore I consider that to that extent it would be advantageous
<col>322</col>
that the tenure of smallholders should be altered. I submit that there were several points in Lord Pentland's speech which are very much open to doubt. I refer, first of all, to the idea that under this Bill he is going to increase considerably the area which is at the present moment in cultivation in Scotland. I very much doubt that, and I should like to ask your Lordships to consider where the noble Lord is going to find this land. He has made a pointed reference to the sheep farms and to the deer forests of Scotland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01178"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Not only did I understand that to be so, but I am sure he voices what we have continually heard on Radical platforms for the last four or five years. The idea is that these 3,000,000 acres which at the present moment help sport can at a stroke of the pen be made to yield, wheat, or that great blocks of this land are to become land which can be profitably farmed by agricultural farmers. May I point out one or two arguments which I think are rather to the point? First, in the crofting districts every crofter has had since 1886 the power to claim land should be wish to do so. Yet there is less land to-day under cultivation even in the crofter area than there was at the time of the passing of the 1886 Act. If you have the Crofters Act and the fact that these men have a fair rent fixed and are not in any way mulcted for any benefits in agriculture which result from their own endeavour, and the further fact that these individuals have not claimed any more land, how do you expect that new tenants are going to do it? Admittedly there are in the deer forests of Scotland a certain number of acres of old arable land. But how many acres are there&#x2014;2,840, according to the Deer Forests Commission. Very likely all that land will be claimed. But how many crofters are you going to fix? By Lord Pentland's own showing they must be crofts of a size to keep the family going, and that would mean at least 20 acres each. So there would be something like 140 families fixed on old arable land. Admittedly, since the Deer Forests Commission, the deer forest area has been very considerably extended; but even supposing that the area of old arable land has been doubled or trebled, you still have under 500 families that you would be able to settle on this old arable land. I believe
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0166"/>
<col>323</col>
it would be very much better if you could use the deer forest land for any other purpose than sport. I consider you can, but I very much doubt that for pure agriculture you will get individuals to go on taking in old arable land. If it has not been done in the past by the existing crofters, except in the immediate vicinity of the coast or where they have other occupations, it is extremely doubtful that it will be done in the future. Where it is feasible I think it is excellent that it should be done, and I at once accept the provision in the Bill; but that you are going to fix any large number of individuals on the waste land of Scotland I very much doubt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01179"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01180"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad that the noble Lord shares my opinion. If these new agriculturists are not going to be fixed on the waste land of Scotland, where are they going to be fixed? They will be fixed either on the sheep farms or the agricultural farms. Therefore the measure of success of this Bill is the number of existing tenants you turn out of their farms. That is a fact which Radical orators have done their best to keep out of sight. The present holders are going to be dispossessed. How is this going to affect the two parties who are to be dispossessed&#x2014;first of all, the sheep farmer with a certain amount of arable land, and then the purely agricultural tenant? The large sheep farmers very often pay as much as &#x00A3;1,000 a year rent, and hold 200 or 300 acres of low ground grazing, and many thousands, sometimes up to as much as 10,000, of acres of hill land. By the division of these sheep farmers' ground&#x2014;and Lord Pentland stated, I think I heard him correctly, that a good deal of this land will be taken from the sheep farms&#x2014;you will be throwing out of gear a great deal of this Hinterland, so to speak, which the small holder will not be likely to be able to deal with, because it will require very large capital to put sheep on the hundreds or thousands of acres which lie behind the small holding. There is another point. The question of wintering is of the most serious importance in the Highlands. The sheep farmer has to send his sheep as far south as Fife for the winter, and the west coast farmer has to send his sheep to the east coast. Is the small holder likely to have the capital to enable him to send his sheep away?
<col>324</col>
I very much doubt it. If he is not able to do it, instead of reducing the area now purely devoted to sport, you will be running the grave danger in certain sheep farm districts of having large additions made to your deer forests. That is another point that Radical orators are apt to lose sight of. A point I wish particularly to insist upon is that the small holding will mainly be made out of the land of your purely agricultural tenants, and therefore the area of cultivated land which you hope to increase in Scotland can only be increased at the expense of what is already agricultural land. Your agricultural area is not going to increase, and therefore I fear the argument of the Secretary for Scotland was based on rather false premises.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I pass from that point to certain difficulties which I see. I very much regret that forestry, which I believe has great possibilities, especially in these waste areas, should be relegated to such an unimportant position in the Bill. When this Bill was first introduced, many of us who were opposed to certain clauses in it were particularly taken with the idea that we were going to have one member of this Board of Agriculture who was to be skilled in a knowledge of forestry. That implied that forestal development might be proceeded with in those parts of Scotland in which it was feasible. The development of these waste lands is only possible under forestry, because forestry is able to take non-agricultural land and turn it to some definite advantage; and with forestry you are able to do with smaller holdings, because a man can live on a two-pounds holding provided he has got regular work throughout the year. Therefore you get over the great difficulty, which you will have in any scheme of small holdings, of the shortage of arable land. That shortage is very much greater in the south-west and in the northern portion of Scotland than anything you have to deal with in England. The crofter and the smallholder generally is a labourer with land, rather than an agriculturist, and if His Majesty's Government would only come to the conclusion that that is so I am sure they would give forestry the proper position in this Bill which it ought to have, a position which I consider it had before these last changes were made.<lb/>
May I refer for a moment to the question of the Court of Appeal, which Lord Balfour
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0167"/>
<col>325</col>
took up so ably. This Bill has been before us since 1906. In 1906 we were definitely promised by Sir Henry Campbell-Banner-man, by Mr. Asquith, and others, that tenants and proprietors were going to have fair and equal justice under this scheme. For three years the Government declined to put in anything which at all corresponds with Clause 7 as it now stands, and for three years there was the hostility of a large section of the Conservative Party. Clause 7, subsection (11), which gives compensation, has now been put in, but you still reserve to the Land Court the final and absolute decision as to the extent to which that compensation should go. I submit that the Land Court is not the proper authority to dispose finally of these claims, and the hardship will be very much greater in the case of the tenant than of the landlord. The landlord in the majority of cases has very much less to lose than the tenant has. Take the sheep farms, where, on your own statement, you expect to get the most of your land. Owing to the pernicious system of valuation which has crept in of late years, small sheep farmers have had to take over the sheep at sums ranging from 25<i>s.</i> above their proper prices, and it would be a very grave miscarriage of justice if the individual has not an appeal in case an unfair decision is made. In exactly the same way with regard to compensation for improvements which the tenant may have made, we think it absolutely necessary and fair that an appeal should be given both to the landlord and the tenant from the Land Court, who are, after all, sitting in their own Court prosecuting work in which they themselves are interested. That power of appeal on the question of value should be given in whichever way His Majesty's Government think best, provided it is a fair one.<lb/>
One word more on the subject of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland. Lord Pentland made a very able defence of the Land Board. I would submit that the whole of the points he raised would have been covered if you had a local Department of the Board of Agriculture sitting in Scotland. You would get the necessary encouragement of agriculture; you would get the whole of those inquiries and researches done which you wanted done locally; and you would have the great advantage that the Department would not cost you so much. Further, you
<col>326</col>
would have the benefit of the whole of the investigations which were going on at the main office in London, and the whole of their <i>personnel</i> and documents to refer to, and all the advantages which are derived from being part of a large Board without having to make a creation of your own in Scotland. The financial question is one of greatest importance. If you are only going to have for the administration of this Act &#x00A3;200,000, how much of that is likely to go in setting up an efficient Board, in sending round the necessary circulars, and in carrying on the investigations and having the Departmental officers throughout the country? Is it likely that out of a beggarly &#x00A3;200,000 you can afford to spend &#x00A3;60,000, which I am informed by a competent authority is the minimum amount you would require to satisfactorily set up a Board of Agriculture in Scotland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01181"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to interrupt the noble Lord, but he will see that the expenses of the administration of this Board will be provided by moneys from Parliament, and will not come out of the &#x00A3;200,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01182"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Then with regard to the question of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act. The noble Lord quoted how well Ireland had done with the new Board. I am prepared to admit that we might have a distinct agricultural advantage if we had a Department in Scotland; but there is one big difference between Scotland and Ireland. One is surrounded by the sea and the other has the land frontier with England. Lord Balfour informed you how the stock continually crossed the Border. Then, again, foot-and-mouth disease can be carried not only by animals but on the boots of individuals who have stepped in the soil used by infected animals. In the case of the land border, individuals, and hares and animals of various kinds, can carry the disease over, and the chance of spreading it is therefore enormously increased. This foot-and-mouth disease, as we know, is at the present moment rampant all over the Continent; there are some 30,000 cases in France alone. We here are the only nation who have been able at all to cope with the disease, and are we to throw away the advantage we now possess? The Board of Agriculture, however much we abuse them
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0168"/>
<col>327</col>
are a tried body who have their recognised and organised work, and not only under Lord Carrington but under other Presidents the Board have been able to swoop down instantly on cases which have appeared, and they have met with the greatest success in the last twelve years in stamping out disease. Is it worth our while as agriculturists to go in for this tremendous risk of having foot-and-mouth disease once more rampant throughout the country? We have heard what the opinion of farmers is. Radical, Conservative, and of every political shade of opinion, they are to a man against the provisions in the Bill with regard to a separate Board for Scotland. As Lord Balfour has pointed out, agriculturists in the north of England are equally firm and speak with the same voice. In view of this consensus of opinion from agricultural Scotland and England, I submit that His Majesty's Government will be well advised if they consider the point further, and see whether they would not get greater advantages by setting up in Scotland a Department of the Board of Agriculture. They would thereby, at any rate in my opinion, get all the advantages which Lord Pentland claimed for a separate Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01183"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the fact that this Bill secured a certain amount of agreement in the House of Commons and passed a Second Reading without a Division is an inducement to your Lordships to give it a Second Reading without a Division here, but I would point out that it proposes to introduce into Scotland some of the worst principles of Irish land legislation. This is not a leap in the dark, or an experiment that is being made in the hope that it may succeed. This is an application to Scotland of the principle of dual ownership which has been tried in Ireland and found wanting. That principle was introduced there by Mr. Gladstone in 1881, and was extended by successive Governments, and it has been found to be productive in Ireland of envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness. Under it we have seen the inauguration of boycotting and illegal conspiracy to withhold rents, a conspiracy which was denounced by the Roman Catholic Church as immoral. We have seen a recrudescence of outrages of every description; and at last this system is being got rid of at a cost to the State of no less than &#x00A3;100,000,000 by way of loan,
<col>328</col>
which may or may not be repaid within seventy years, and a sum of &#x00A3;20,000,000 as a free gift&#x2014;a not inconsiderable addition to the already very heavy burdens of the taxpayers of this country.<lb/>
Under this system of dual ownership we have seen in Ireland the whole country over-run by a horde of officials who are only required for the purpose of fixing rents, and who would not be requisitioned for that purpose if it were not believed that the fixing of rents and the lowering of rents were synonymous terms. We have seen landlords refraining from making any improvements to their land from the conviction that there is no chance of obtaining any return for their outlay, and we have seen tenants refraining from making the best use of their holdings in the belief that the worse the state of the holding when it comes to be examined by the Commissioner the greater the chance of the rent being reduced for the next fifteen years. Under this system we have seen landlord and tenant drifting further and further apart, and it is this system which His Majesty's Government now propose to impose upon a peaceable, contented, and prosperous country. For the reason I have given I suppose it would be impossible not to read the Bill a second time, but I do hope that when the Committee stage is reached Amendments will be proposed to remove its worst blots, and, above all, to ensure that the tribunal set up with such extensive powers shall be one which will command the confidence, not only of those who are going to be put upon their neighbours' land, but also of those who are being changed from the position of land owners to that of rent chargers, and chargers of a variable rent which is to be fixed without any reference to their wishes.<lb/>
I shall be told that this system of dual ownership already exists in the north of Scotland. I confess that I do not know anything about the Highlands, and if this Bill were confined to that part of Scotland I should not have taken part in this debate; but as it is proposed to extend it to the Lowlands of Scotland, and I am intimately acquainted with that part of the country, I venture to take part in the discussion. I should like to say a few words with regard to the large tenant farmers in the south of Scotland. I think your Lordships will all agree that as a class there are few that can equal
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0169"/>
<col>329</col>
those men, and none that can surpass them. They are men of intelligence, they are men of capital, they work their farms by up-to-date methods, and at large expense they have provided themselves with up-to-date appliances which are specially suitable according to the size of the farm which they have to work. I know that it is intended, if possible, not to take land from these men, and that if there is other land vacant the Board of Agriculture is directed to choose it for preference. But supposing it is not available they will be obliged to have recourse to these farms, and then every tenant whose lease dates from a later period than 1906 may find that his very best bit of land is taken from him. It is said that he will be compensated for that. But what compensation can there be to either landlord or tenant; if the very eye of the farm is taken out, and a farm which is fitted in every way to work a certain number of acres is suddenly reduced very much in extent? Further than that, he will find that this land is taken possession of by new holders who hold on a very different system of tenure. Not only will a fair rent be fixed upon their holdings by an outside tribunal, but there will be fixity of tenure. We have heard that if the large farmers desire to have the privilege of fixity of tenure and equitable rents, His Majesty's Government see no reason why that should not be granted to them. I quite agree with that opinion. In fairness it could not be otherwise, and I think the larger farmers will wish to have the same facilities as the smaller ones. We shall see these landowners all turned into rent chargers no longer taking any interest in their property, but liable at any moment to be called upon by the tenant to make improvements to the farm, whether or not at the same time they are involved in large expenditure on other parts of their property, and in the event of their refusing to do so they will find the statutory holder turned into a land holder.<lb/>
With regard to the Land Court, an Amendment was moved in another place proposing that there should be an appeal from the Land Court. Noble Lords who have spoken here have said that that is an absolute necessity. I only hope they will get it. I know in the case of Irish land appeals we have tried very hard to obtain that favour, and have been met
<col>330</col>
with a stern refusal by His Majesty's Government; but in the event of its not being granted I think it is most essential that there should be complete confidence in the Court which is set up. I venture to differ from the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland when he says that the functions of this Court will be purely judicial and not in any way administrative. I should like, with his permission, to read the fifth subsection of Clause 25 of this Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"Three members of the Land Court shall be a quorum; Provided that it shall be lawful for the Land Court to delegate such of their powers as they think expedient to any one member or to any two members of the Court."</quote>
As I understand that, they may delegate to any one member of the Court the power to examine land and value it and fix the rent upon it. There is an appeal from that to three members of the Court, of whom one may be the very delegate who has already fixed the price. That seems to me to be an appeal, not from Philip drunk to Philip sober; if the chairman is not one of these three to whom the appeal is made, and there is nothing in the Bill to say that he is to be one, it is rather an appeal from Philip drunk to Philip half-seas-over. With a view to absolute fairness it is, in my opinion, absolutely essential to put in a proviso that the member of the Board of Agriculture who examines and values the land should under no circumstances be promoted to be a member of the Land Court. He is appointed for the purpose of putting small tenants on the land, and also to have the care of the Government money, which he will wish to use as economically as possible, and he will have a certain bias against giving landowners larger compensation than is necessary; and with a view to ensure fairness in the Court, I think it very desirable that an Amendment of that kind should be introduced in Committee.<lb/>
One word on the question of fair rent, because it seems to me that noble Lords from Scotland hardly realise how very important the definition of "fair rent" is Lord Pentland gave us a long explanation of what an equitable rent was, and how well it was set out in the Bill. I quite agree with him&#x2014;whether it is satisfactory or not is another matter&#x2014;that it is very clear; but the only definition I can find of a fair rent is contained in the 6th Section of the first Crofters Act. That is extremely vague, I think. Noble Lords who come
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0170"/>
<col>331</col>
from Ireland, and who have had experience of Irish land legislation, are well aware that there is no phrase which has caused more disputes than the phrase "a fair rent," and it is one with regard to which over and over again a wish has been expressed on the part of Judges as well as others that Parliament had given some clear definition of it. In 1897 a Royal Commission was appointed, of which Sir Edward Fry was Chairman, to inquire into this very question of fair rent. I am not going to bother your Lordships with long extracts from the Report. It is full of information. I will venture, with the permission of the House, to read two very short extracts on the subject. The Report says&#x2014;
<quote>"Even now, after the Act of 1881 has been in operation for more than sixteen years, there is, so far as we can learn, no judicial exposition of the two weightiest words in the whole Statute&#x2014;'fair rents.'"</quote>
And, according to the statement of the Lord Chief Justice on November 29, 1897, the members of the Commission differed amongst themselves as to the principles and methods by which a fair rent should be ascertained. The other extract is very short&#x2014;
<quote>"We are convinced, as we have already shown, that the settlement of fair rents has been effected in an unsatisfactory manner with diversity of opinion and practice, sometimes with carelessness, and sometimes with that bias towards one side or the other which exists in many honest minds."</quote>
With that evidence in front of us of what the result of not having a definition of fair rent has been in Ireland, I venture to suggest to noble Lords from Scotland that it is of the greatest importance that they should have a clear definition of what is a fair rent, as well as an equitable rent, inserted in the Bill. In this very Report there are suggestions as to how that should be done which I shall venture to adopt in the form of an Amendment when the Committee stage is reached.<lb/>
One other point in connection with fair rent. Once a fair rent has been fixed, for good or for evil, whether to the advantage of the tenant or the landlord, it should be made the basis of all future changes&#x2014;that is, it should not be arbitrarily changed; and only two factors should be allowed to be considered in future revisions of the rent, one the cost of production and the other the cost, as it has varied, of agricultural produce. If this is done I think it will give both landlords and tenants more
<col>332</col>
sense of security, on the one hand as to the value of the rent which they are likely to receive, and on the other hand a likelihood of a reduction or a rise in the rent at the next revision. I do not think that any Amendments can make this Bill a good one. That is impossible, as it is founded on the vicious principle of dual ownership. The true solution, in my opinion, is only to be found in land purchase; and I look forward to the time, which I am confident will come as surely as day follows night, when a Bill will be introduced, I hope by a Unionist Government, giving effect to land purchase, and thus remove the friction which I am sure must be engendered between landlord and tenant by this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01184"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that all of us on this side will agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lovat, that had this been a measure for increasing the number of small holdings in Scotland there would have been no objection to it. It is a matter of real regret to us that the Government have chosen a method for bringing small holdings into existence which must arouse a great deal of objection and opposition on this side of the House. The noble Lord, Lord Pentland, prides himself, as I have no doubt he is quite entitled to do, on the fact that in regard to this Bill he has met the Party on this side in a considerable way. Credit should be given to him for his attempt to meet us, but the crowning mercy which he has extended to us is to take certain holdings out of the operation of the Crofters Act and put them under Clause 32 of this Bill. It is a fact, as stated, that they are out of the Crofters Act, but they are in something else which is scarcely distinguishable from the Crofters Act; they have been taken away from the letter of that Act, but in spirit they still remain. In many respects I believe that Clause 32 is almost worse than the Crofters Act itself. Indeed, there is so little difference between them, that when the Lord Advocate was put to it to defend this clause in another place from the attacks of his own supporters he had to tell them that this new clause did not differ in essentials from the old clause.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland is afflicted with the theory, very common nowadays, that a large increase of small holdings is a universal cure, or perhaps a sovereign remedy, for all the ills which
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0171"/>
<col>333</col>
affect rural districts: depopulation, want of prosperity, and everything else. That is an absolute fallacy. I believe there is a very real advantage in increasing the number of small holdings provided they are increased in a practical and reasonable way and within proper limits. But I do fear very much indeed that if people in their enthusiasm for small holdings work this Bill as it could be worked, and accumulate small holdings merely for the pleasure of accumulating them, the result may be very opposite to what is desired. The noble Lord, Lord Lovat, said that the, measure of the success of the small holdings scheme must be the number of the large holdings which you dispossess. I believe that is an absolutely sound remark. In order to give security of tenure to small holders you are taking away security of tenure from the large holders. Everybody acquainted with agriculture and the management of estates knows perfectly well that one of the conditions necessary for the proper carrying on of agriculture in this country is a reasonable degree of security of tenure. That security has been granted by our custom, I believe for a long time, and there is nothing which has broken into that security so much as these recent Small Holdings Bills. I fancy the noble Lord, Lord Pentland, does not like large holdings; at all events he told us that arable culture&#x2014;which means, I think, grain growing&#x2014;was not paying at the present time in Scotland, and would only pay under expert management. He implied, I thought, that that expert management would be found under the small holding rather than under the large holding. If he says so, I absolutely disagree with him. I do not know where he has got his experience of small holdings, because I am quite certain that if we are to keep up the high standard of farming which we fortunately have arrived at in Scotland and of which we are proud, it is essential that we should keep our large holdings. We shall never under a system of small holdings get the high quality of stock that we now have.<lb/>
The noble Lord compared this country with foreign countries in the matter of small holdings. That is an absolutely unfair comparison. In every other country the small holder is protected by large tariff duties. In no other country than this has he to pay the great burden of local taxation; and in almost every other
<col>334</col>
country the success of the small holder depends on the fact that the holding is carried out on an ownership basis. The noble Lord tells us that there is no desire for an ownership basis here, and that under the English Small Holders Act no advantage is taken of the possible scheme of land purchase. Does it not occur to him that the fault may be, not in the small holders' want of desire to become owners, but in the particular scheme which is before them? As a matter of fact, there is a fault in the scheme. The scheme requires a much too large proportion of the capital value of the land to be paid down by the tenant himself, an amount which the tenant cannot afford. If a different scheme was brought in to effect the same object, it is my opinion that the small holders and many tenants would be very glad to take advantage of it. It is not only for the purpose that I mentioned that we require large holdings to continue in this country; we require them for the purpose of the small holder himself. It is very important in country districts that you should have a proper graded mixture of farms large and small, if for no other reason than that it gives small holders something to look forward to. It enables them to find some scope for their ambition, and gives them a ladder on which they may rise from small holdings up to large ones. An ideal estate is one with a proper mixture of small and large holdings, and but for these large holdings there would be in many districts of the country practically no one to give any employment at all. I believe that is one of the conditions in the interests of small holders which must be most carefully examined before we go into any small holdings scheme. In the ordinary case a small holder on a holding devoted only to the purposes of agriculture does not earn a living better than&#x2014;very seldom equal to&#x2014;that of an ordinary agricultural labourer, and if he is to keep his wife and family in comfort, if he is to have any opportunity of improving his own condition, there must be a possibility to him of earning money elsewhere. And I say that the demand for labour in any locality must to a very large extent govern the number of holdings which you can create under any scheme. Of course, it is different in the case of market gardens or fruit farms. Those possibly on very suitable land may be multiplied to almost any extent, provided, of course, you keep within the proper limits of supply and demand.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0172"/>
<col>335</col>
If we overstep the limits within which small holdings can be practically created in this country, if we try, as I say, merely to accumulate small holdings, then I am afraid this or any small holdings scheme will end in disaster and failure, and certainly in the poverty of the small holder. It is a perfectly fair comparison to compare what is going on now in the Western Islands with what you propose to do under this Bill. For some twelve or thirteen years the Congested Districts Board have been experimenting in that part of the country. They were face to face with a desperate problem, and I do not blame them in the least for starting the experiments, but I do not think any one can say at the present moment that they have been a success. If noble Lords will read the Annual Report of the Secretary for Scotland they will see that the condition of small holders there cannot be described as satisfactory. In a large number of cases they are behind with their rents, many cannot pay the interest on their loans, and many are very much in arrear in their repayments of instalments of capital on loans from the State. I think there is hardly a case amongst those people where there is any prospect of their succeeding in life; there is scarcely a chance for those men to make more than the barest living, except with the continual assistance of the State. You have created small holdings there by cutting up larger farms, you have done away with the men of capital, you have decreased the amount of employment, and you have brought about what is practically a dead level of poverty over whole districts; and I fear that there is an indication under this Bill that you intend to proceed further in that direction. You do away with Section 3 of the Crofters Act, which protects farms below a certain limit of rent. Subsection (<i>c</i>), I think it is, provides that no holding under a hundred a year shall be available for new holdings or for the enlargement of small holdings. In place of that you give protection to farms of 150 acres. What is a 150-acre farm in the Western Highlands? There is no protection to the man of capital or the man who employs labour in those districts unless you give a bigger limit than this 150 acres. I think that is a matter to which the noble Lord ought to turn his serious attention, because if small farms of less than a hundred a year are to be broken up in the Western Highlands, I fear disaster will follow.<lb/>
<col>336</col>
My Lords, I do not want to exaggerate these matters in the slightest degree. I am not suggesting, even though this Bill is carried out to its fullest possible extent, that the condition of, affairs that we see in the west is likely to be duplicated in the east and south of Scotland, but I do say that unless it is carried out with more knowledge and less zeal there is a very great danger of our arriving at something which will be comparable to this failure in the west of Scotland. Noble Lords have dealt so fully with it that I may be excused from going into the latter part of the Bill. But there are two points on Clause 32 about which I wish to say a word. In subsection (1) it is provided that a legatee of a tenant shall be considered his successor in his holding. Those are, roughly speaking, the words. By a later subsection of the same clause the successor in the holding has a right to the renewal of the lease. Consequently the legatee has a right of renewal. Under our Agricultural Holdings Act of 1908 a tenant has practically an unlimited right of bequest of the remaining years of his lease&#x2014;that is to say, he can bequeath to almost any one he pleases so many years as may remain before the termination of his lease. But think what an extension this is. You give to that tenant the right of bequeathing, not to his own family or relation, but to any one he pleases, and not only his lease but a permanent right to the renewal of that lease. That is very much further than the Crofters Act goes. The Crofters Act gives a right of bequest to the relatives, and I think the relatives are specially defined; but here in cases where the holdings are not under the Crofters Act, where as a special concession they have been taken out of the Crofters Act, you put the holder in this different position from the crofter, that he has a wider power of bequest than you have granted to the crofter.<lb/>
There is another point later in the clause on which I should like to say a word. I refer to the Land Court. Considerable attention has been paid to that to-night, but chiefly on the ground of demanding that some appeal shall be given from the findings of that Court. In the case of the statutory small tenant whose buildings and everything belong to the landlord, the chief business of the Land Court will be to settle questions of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0173"/>
<col>337</col>
rent. Those will involve in single cases very small sums, but over a large group of cases will amount to a considerable sum, and they will not, I presume, come into the scheme which has been suggested as the subject of appeal. I suppose one could hardly ask for an appeal with regard to small sums of 10<i>s</i>. or a &#x00A3;1 or so, but I do submit that these tenants who are in a totally different position from the crofters, who are admittedly a non-crofting body of men, ought not to have applied to them a crofting form of valuation. I do not want to repeat many of the very hard things I hear said about the Land Court in Scotland, but it is a fact that we do regard the Land Court with suspicion. We cannot regard it, as the noble Lord does, as a fair and impartial body; we believe from the composition of that Court, from the way in which it is appointed, from its standing in this Act, that though it may have the best intentions in the world, it is bound to have a bias in favour of the small holder. Apart from the question of its impartiality, I would like to raise a question of its competence. Who are to be the members of the Land Court? That is a point on which the noble Lord might enlighten us. We would like to know who are to be appointed members of that Court. The noble Lord displays ignorance. Is there no indication that can be given to us of who these men may be, or even their Chairman. Such information might very considerably affect our views on this matter.<lb/>
There is nothing in this Bill which shows that the members of the Land Court are to be appointed on account of their knowledge of agriculture; yet we are told they are to value the small holdings through their own knowledge and experience. They may be very eminent&#x2014;I have no doubt they will be&#x2014;but it is much more important to us to know whether they will be good valuers; and I object to any central body of valuers for a valuation of this kind. The whole essence of land valuation, even the first rudimentary principles of it, depends upon a local knowledge of the particular class of land with which the valuer has to deal. He wants to know the outgoings and incomings in the district, and all the advantages or disadvantages that may accrue to land in the particular locality. No central body can know that, and for that reason we object to such immense
<col>338</col>
power over an important part of our income from land being put within the control of this Land Court. There is a very fair system of valuation in existence. You may say that your system is fair; but I say it is not the fairest possible way, and we are entitled to ask for the fairest possible, way. The old system of valuation in Scotland is that each man should appoint his own valuer and call in an umpire in case of any differences. That system has worked satisfactorily for centuries. Recent Acts of Parliament have modified that idea. The 1908 Act provides that the valuer shall be appointed by the parties, and, failing agreement, by the Board. I readily accept that form of valuation. It is not the valuation I am fighting about, but the form of tribunal that you set up over us to make that valuation. I should like to say a few words with regard to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland. When Lord Balfour was referring to the Diseases of Animals Act the Secretary for Scotland seemed anxious to interpose a remark. Am I right in thinking that the noble Lord wished to say that the Government had agreed to take the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act out of the control of this new body?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01185"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That was not my intention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01186"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I was hoping that it was.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01187"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I did say, when discussing that subject, that I understood, and this debate has confirmed it, that such proposals were likely to be brought forward, and that the Government would do their best to consider them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01188"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I was hoping that it went further&#x2014;that the Government were willing to accept them. But in any case I am bound to raise this question, because as chairman of the Central Chamber of Agriculture I have within the last two days received resolutions from no fewer than six Chambers of Agriculture in different counties in England protesting against this proposal to separate the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act. Those resolutions have come from as far North as the Berwick and Borders Agricultural Association down to as far South as South Wilts; and there is a general feeling throughout England that there is a great danger indeed in
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0174"/>
<col>339</col>
decentralising the administration of this particular Act. I do not want to trouble your Lordships with details. We all understand the awful risk that there is of disease. I am proud of the administration of the Act by the Board of Agriculture. I think it is one of their greatest claims to merit. The statistics show this year that, with the single exception of swine fever, all the notifiable diseases have decreased. It is true that we have had unfortunate outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, but owing to the control by the Board of Agriculture they have been able to throw armies of men, inspectors and others, into the affected districts and confine the disease within the smallest possible limits. Compare that with what happened in the eighties when in a single year, presumably owing to bad management, this disease became epidemic and some 300,000 or 400,000 cattle were affected. We are satisfied with our administration now, and I do not think the Government ought to ask us to risk a recurrence of these disasters by making any change in that administration. That is the English case.<lb/>
There is a Scottish case too, as the noble Lord knows. In Scotland they are equally agreed that there should be no change in the administration. For the first time since I have known agriculturist bodies in Scotland, they are unanimous about the Board of Agriculture not going under the Secretary for Scotland. I say that without the slightest disrespect to the noble Lord or to any of his predecessors in office. I do not think that has entered into the spirit of any of the resolutions. But it is felt that it is not right to take such an important thing as the agricultural industry out of the hands of a fully equipped body such as the Board of Agriculture is at present, out of the control of men of very high scientific and practical attainments who have had great experience in these matters, and put it into the hands of a Department like the Scottish Office, which already has, I suppose, more diverse matters of detail to attend to than any other Department of the State. If the noble Lord turns to the opinion of Scotland, I do not think he will find any in favour of putting agriculture under his own Office. I hope the Government will give consideration to that point, as well as to the question of the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act.</membercontribution></p>
<col>340</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01189"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall endeavour to make the few remarks I propose to address to the House as brief as possible. A great many of the points which have been raised are points which certainly will reappear in Committee, and therefore it will probably be better to defer discussion of them, or at all events the larger part, until that time. But before I proceed to make a few remarks upon the Bill I really must call attention to the drafting. Of all the Bills that I have ever seen since I have been a member of Parliament I consider that this is the very worst drafted. I do not know whether the Lord Chancellor amidst his multifarious occupations has had time to read the Bill. I hope for his sake that he has not. On several occasions the noble and learned Earl has objected to legislation by reference. This Bill, however, not only legislates by reference, but by double reference and triple reference. The noble Lord, Lord Balfour, mentioned Clause 38, which contains wording which cannot possibly have occurred in any previous Bill. After o stating that the Acts specified in the Schedule are repealed, it continues&#x2014;
<quote>"and so much of any Act as is inconsistent with this Act is also hereby repealed."</quote>
Can bad drafting go further? It is impossible for any human being to tell what is repealed and what is not. The noble Lord has been good enough to circulate a large Paper and we are much obliged to him, but that Paper itself condemns the Bill because it shows that previous legislation is interfered with, by reference only, to an unprecedented extent.<lb/>
Now let me turn to the proposal in the Bill that there should be a separate Board of Agriculture under the Secretary for Scotland. I speak, of course, without any reference to the present occupant of the office. Lord Clinton said, most properly, that the Secretary for Scotland is a maid of all work&#x2014;those are not his exact words, but the substance of them&#x2014;and that he has already got a great many more matters than he can possibly attend to. For instance, among other things, he is the Chairman of the Congested Districts Board and reports to Parliament every year. I wonder how many meetings of that Board he has ever attended&#x2014;of course not one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01190"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I must correct the assumption of the noble Earl. I cannot give him the exact figure, but I have
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0175"/>
<col>341</col>
attended every meeting that has taken place since I have boon in office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01191"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Where? and how many meetings have there been? I will accept the correction of my assumption, but I do not accept the correction of my facts; and if the noble Lord assures us that he has taken an active part in the deliberations of the Congested Districts Board, all I can say is he is making a very large claim upon our credence. But let me say that no single agricultural body, or body of any other kind or sort, has been found to advocate this plan of a separate Board of Agriculture under the Secretary for Scotland. A proposal was made in favour of a Department of the English Board of Agriculture with the Chairman a Member of Parliament and responsible to Parliament. But no one has advocated throwing upon the Secretary for Scotland any duty in connection with that Board.<lb/>
The plan of the noble Lord's Bill is to create new holdings. How does he propose to do that? He proposes to create them at the expense of the taxpayer. Why? Because he says the holdings cannot pay; they are not economical. I" remember the noble Lord saying in this House in 1909 that&#x2014;
<quote>"The way we meet this difficulty is to provide funds by which the cost of adaptation should be borue by the taxpayer. You could not lay on the small holder the cost of adaptation without obliging him to sit at a rout which would be unfair."</quote>
Remember, my Lords, that this Government is a Free Trade Government; yet here a favoured class of landholders is being set up at the expense of the State. If they require assistance to set them up, what security have you that they are going on and going to succeed? I do not like to remind the noble Lord, because I have done so so often, of what happened at Vatersay. At the same time Vatersay is an instance that should be set up as a monument of what you ought to avoid. If the taxpayer really realised that these holders were to be set up at his expense simply because they could not pay a fair rent&#x2014;that is, a rent which will cover the cost of their buildings and the adaptation of the land&#x2014;he would, I think, be not altogether pleased. The noble Lord when told that he creates dual ownership by this Bill, said that he leaves the present relation of landlord and tenant just as it is.</membercontribution></p>
<col>342</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01192"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01193"><member>THE EARL OP CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: He said so. I took the words down. Perhaps he may not have meant it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01194"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Earl will allow me to tell him what I said&#x2014; namely, that the intention, and, so far as I could judge, the effect, of the Bill was to interfere with the existing relations of landlord and tenant as little as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01195"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: But that little as possible means that yon set up two landlords and one tenant. Take the case of a new holding. The Commissioner comes to me and says, ''I want a bit of your land to make a small holding of." I say, "Very well." He says, "Will you please put up the buildings." I say, "No, thank you, because if I put up buildings the result will be that those buildings will be a sort of plaything for the Land Court, who at some future stage can make the rent any figure they please. Therefore I prefer that you should do it." So the State is a landlord in regard to the buildings, and I am the landlord in regard to the land, and then there is the tenant; so you are creating dual ownership.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord proceeded to deal with what are known as statutory tenancies&#x2014;that is, those of existing tenants whose improvements have been paid for by the landlord. I want to repeat the question which was put just now by Lord Clinton. You admit that these statutory tenancies are quite different altogether from what have hitherto been crofts, because you put them in a separate clause. The landlord having done everything, why is he to be subjected to the Land Court with regard to the question of compensation and so on? Clause 32 says he is to be under the Act of 1908. He is to be dealt with under the Agricultural Holdings Act and not under the Crofters Acts. Why should you not extend the system of valuation which is given in the 1908 Act? Why with regard to compensation should be under the 1908 Act, and with regard to rent and so on under this Bill? For, remember this, you bring in the Land Court in a case with which the Land Court originally had nothing to do. It is a case where the landlord has done everything. Why, then, should you not follow the provision you have made in your 1908 Act? Then, my
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0176"/>
<col>343</col>
Lords, this Land Court is irresponsible; there is no appeal from it. I noticed that in describing the Land Court to us the noble Lord entirely omitted to call attention to the fact that there is no appeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01196"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I described the Court as final.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01197"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord to that extent said it was a final Court. But why should it be a final Court? Observe what the Land Court can do. The noble Lord said also that its duties were entirely judicial. I do not know why he said that. Just look at Clause 7, subsection (11). The Land Court is to declare&#x2014;
<quote>(<i>a</i>) In respect of what land, if any, specified in the scheme, one or more holdings for new holders may respectively be constituted, and up to what date the power to constitute them otherwise than by agreement may be exercised;</quote>
<quote>(<i>b</i>) What is the fair rent for each new holding;</quote>
What is that but an administrative act? Is that a judicial act? Then&#x2014;
<quote>(<i>c</i>) What land, if any, specified in the scheme is to be excluded therefrom; and</quote>
<quote>(<i>d</i>) Whatever else may be necessary for the purpose of making the scheme effective and of adjusting the rights of all parties interested in or affected by the proceedings.</quote>
Are those judicial acts? I own that the word "final" did not attract my attention so much as it ought to have done; but, at all events, it was merely mentioned as showing that there was no appeal. In the first place, how is this Land Court going to be constituted? That is the important point. The noble Lord said it was to be composed of skilled persons. There is nothing whatever in the Bill to say that. The only thing in the Bill is that one of them is to be able to speak the Gaelic language. That is the only indication, so far as I know, of any requirement being necessary from any individual.<lb/>
Then we are told that the Chairman is to have the rank of a Judge, but, as Lord Balfour pointed out, that does not give him any of the qualities of a Judge. I can supply an answer to Lord Balfour&#x2014;at least I think I can&#x2014;as to why those words were inserted in the House of Commons. There was a proposal put forward that the valuation Judges should be the Court of Appeal. The Lord Advocate said that to appeal from this
<col>344</col>
Court to the valuation judges would be to appeal from a higher Court to a lower Court. I suppose the words "the rank of a Judge" were merely inserted for the purpose of giving the chairman the sort; of <i>status</i> and position of a Judge. It is most important that we should know who the chairman of this Land Court is to be, because as the Bill now stands you are giving to this Court, without any appeal, without any check of any sort or kind, the absolute right of disposing as they choose of practically all the holdings in Scotland up to &#x00A3;50, because the statutory tenant is brought under the Land Court as the Bill stands very nearly as much as the new holder. On the appointment of that chairman almost everything may turn. The noble Lord has grave responsibility attaching to him in the appointment which he makes, because if this Bill is to be administered by anybody having the <i>status</i> of a Judge he ought to have the qualities of a Judge, he ought to be a person who is perfectly impartial, with no bias either on one side or the other; he ought to be prepared to carry out this Bill just in the same way as it would be carried out by the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack. If a person is appointed who has before now expressed and carried into action strong views with, regard to the points which come up in the administration of this Bill, all I can say is that it seems to me such an appointment as that would be much to be deplored.<lb/>
For the plan of the Bill there is, so far as I know, no precedent in any country in the world. The result must be to divert capital to a large extent from creating small holdings. I suppose there are many noble Lords in this House who have created small holdings. I have created some myself. When this Bill becomes an Act, shall I ever create another? Certainly not. What a foolish thing it would be, because if I created another holding the only result would be that it would fall under the Land Court in the end. Therefore it seems to me that no prudent person will ever think of creating a small holding. There is one thing which struck me as noteworthy&#x2014;namely, what the noble Lord said about voluntary holdings. The noble Lord tells us that there is in this Bill a power left to the landowner of creating small holdings at his own expense which he can let to whomsoever he chooses and which will not come within this Bill. The
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0177"/>
<col>345</col>
noble Lord will, I think, agree that at present there is nothing in the Bill to say so. If he does not agree, perhaps he will kindly say where it can be found in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01198"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: No; but there is nothing in the Bill which in any way impairs the right which landlords have at present to do that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01199"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: If there are people as thick witted as I am who do not happen to see that, I presume the noble Lord can have no objection to words being put in, in the form of an Amendment, to make; that perfectly plain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01200"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My experience is very limited, but I think such words would be extremely unusual.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01201"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: What is worse than unusual is uncertainty, and if the noble Lord's intention is what he says it is, then I do not see how he can object to the insertion of words to make it clear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01202"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl will, perhaps, put an Amendment down. I shall be very glad&#x2014;with it or without it&#x2014;to consider the suggestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01203"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged. I do not think I need detain your Lordships with more than one or two further words. With regard to optional purchase, the noble Lord says nobody wishes to purchase. How does he know that? He says, "Because they have not purchased in England." But, on the other hand, he is always appealing to the authority of Members of Parliament. One of the Members for Aberdeenshire said that that was not at all true in Aberdeenshire, and that there were a great many people in Aberdeenshire who would like to purchase. We are not proposing, and nobody has proposed, to put into the Bill that people shall purchase; it is simply to place it at their option if they wish to purchase. What objection can there be to a proposal of that sort? But that also is a matter for Committee. Like other noble Lords who have spoken, I am anxious, and have been for a very long time, for a settlement of this question, and I have gone so far as to say&#x2014;the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack knows it&#x2014;that though I still believe that the
<col>346</col>
county councils would be the best persons to administer this Act, yet at the same time I am not going to insist upon that point. But that does not mean that I accept a Land Court which is to determine all these things in any way that it wishes and without any right of appeal. I am sorry to have troubled your Lordships so long, and shall reserve my other remarks for Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01204"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I imagine that the House will expect a few words to be said from this Bench upon the important measure which is before us, and I am the more tempted to say something because I cannot help hoping that by doing so I shall elicit from noble Lords opposite some kind of reply to the series of instructive speeches to which we have listened from this side of the House. Those speeches should, I think, have sufficed to convince the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that our attitude towards the Bill is anything but one of obstruction. We have, however, a right to be critical because the measure, as the noble Lord, I am sure, will himself admit, is one abounding in provisions which lend themselves to criticism. I should have been very much inclined to say something upon the form of the Bill had not that point been dealt with by my noble friend who has just sat down. I will only say that I agree with him in believing that a more complicated Bill, a Bill containing a greater jumble of provisions, never was laid upon the Table of the Houses of Parliament. I should like to put it to the noble. Lord opposite in this way. Supposing you were to take this Bill and put it into the hands of a small Scottish farmer, the man whom it is intended to benefit. I will undertake to say that if you were to lock him up for half-a-dozen hours with that Bill in his hands, he would at the end of the time understand as little about it as he did at the beginning.<lb/>
I will pass, however, to one or two questions of substance about which I think something should be said. In the first place, there is the proposal that this new Board of Agriculture should be created for Scotland. I confess that I look askance upon these frequently repeated proposals to create new Boards. They are always expensive, and involve a heavy charge to the taxpayer. They also have this feature about them, that
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0178"/>
<col>347</col>
they tend to increase the amount of Government patronage; and I am bound to say&#x2014;I say it quite without reference to the fact that. His Majesty's present advisers will have the patronage of this Bill&#x2014;that this constant increase of Government patronage is a bad thing for the country as a whole. These proposals are always defended on the ground that they involve decentralisation, a blessed word in the estimation of many people. But is it not the case that decentralisation may have the effect of conducing to anything but efficiency and consistency of administration? And I must say that a more unfortunate instance in which to apply the principle of decentralisation than the administration of the law with regard to the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act in my opinion could hardly have been selected. This is not a Scottish question. It is a question which concerns the whole of the British islands. By all means let us recognise those racial peculiarities upon which the noble Lord opposite dwelt; by all means let us recognise local sentiment whether it be that of Scotland or Ireland or this country; but there is no local peculiarity in the different varieties of contagious diseases with which our authorities have to deal. A mad dog, for instance, in Scotland is very much the same kind of mad dog as a mad dog on the South of the Border, and pleuro-pneumonia is, I fancy, exactly the same whether it attacks a Highland steer or a Jersey cow in the South of England. What reason can there be for bringing in an administration which will no longer be uniform, and which because it will no longer be uniform is bound to be less efficient than the administration which we now enjoy?<lb/>
Noble Lords who have spoken on this side of the House have proved beyond all dispute that agricultural opinion is solid against the noble Lord and his Bill at this point. What is the noble Lord's answer? "Oh," he says, "agricultural opinion is well and good; but give me the opinion of the House of Commons." This is precisely the kind of matter with regard to which I trust agricultural opinion and do not trust the House of Commons. I will tell you why I trust agricultural opinion. It is the opinion of men who still remember what this country went through in the days when the whole of it, or a great part of it, was ravaged by cattle plague in the
<col>348</col>
'sixties. I can remember the time when as one travelled through the country one saw on every side the great mounds in the fields which marked the places where these wretched animals had been buried; and since those days there have been other outbreaks of serious disease. These things are not forgotten, and the farmers do not want to run any risk of these misfortunes recurring amongst us. There is a rather striking example which I think the noble Lord might bear in mind. I am told that in South Africa the administration of the laws affecting cattle disease has been placed in the hands of a Union Minister, and that Union Minister happens to be no less a person than the Prime Minister. I hope that, as we are promised, there will be a due examination of our suggestions at the Committee stage, and that the alternative suggested by my noble friend Lord Lovat and by others who have addressed the House will be considered by the noble Lord opposite at any rate with an open mind.<lb/>
I will deal for a moment with the provisions of the Bill regulating the future tenure of land in Scotland. They seem to me to be needlessly complicated, to involve at many points quite unnecessary interference between parties, and to be novel and altogether opposed to the principle by which we have hitherto been guided in dealing with these matters. What is the plea which is urged in support of these proposals? It is the old argument founded upon the fact, for it is a fact, that rural depopulation has been going on in Scotland. The noble Lord opposite inundated us with statistics, and I have no doubt his statistics are perfectly trustworthy. But he took no pains whatever to connect the statistics which he gave us with regard to the large area under deer forests and otherwise reserved for sporting purposes with the movement of the population, and he did not in any way attempt to show, or succeed in showing, that the two things stood to one another in the relation of cause and effect. There are other reasons, of which the noble Lord must be perfectly aware, reasons which apply not to Scotland alone, which have led to the concentration of the population in the large towns. It seems to me that the noble Lord might as well expect to stop a flood with a mop as expect that anything to be done within the compass of this Bill is likely
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0179"/>
<col>349</col>
to change the face of the country in Scotland and to bring back to the regions at present held as deer forests and sheep farms the population that has left them. What are the reasons that have led the people not only in Scotland to leave the remoter parts of the country? It is because they would not tolerate the conditions of existence, the drudgery, the dull surroundings which they had to face so long as they were engaged in cultivating little unremunerative plots in these wild and inaccessible places. There is no doubt about that; and does the noble Lord really think that by such legislation as this he is going to convert the Highlands of Scotland into a country resembling Belgium or Denmark&#x2014;the two cases which he cited to us? My Lords, this is raising false hopes and expectations; and I cannot help thinking that the noble Lord would do well to avoid importing into these arguments what I cannot help calling a certain amount of prejudice by the citation of these examples.<lb/>
I pass to the different classes of tenants who, if this Bill becomes law, will emerge under the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i>. In the first place, we have tenants above the limit laid down in Clause 26&#x2014;tenants whose holdings are over 50 acres in extent or whose rent is over &#x00A3;50 a year. I am grateful to the noble Lord for leaving these tenants at any rate to take care of themselves. They are perfectly well able to do so. They are no doubt vulnerable under this Bill in other respects, because they may be despoiled of part of their holdings in order to satisfy the demand for smaller holdings; but so far as freedom of contract is concerned I understand the noble Lord leaves them alone. Then I come to the great class of so called "landholders" created for the first time under this Bill, which class I understand includes the present crofters and the smaller tenants who have been in the habit of themselves executing their own improvements. So far as the proposals of the Bill have reference to this class, I do not greatly quarrel with them. As I understand the principle of the proposal, these are men who by executing their own improvements have relieved the landlord of what is usually regarded in this country as a landlord's obligation, and who have, therefore, become entitled themselves to some of the incidents of ownership. By all means, therefore, let us recognise that fact, and let us secure their position as we have secured it in

similar cases in other parts of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
Then I come to another variety, and this time to an entirely new variety, of tenant&#x2014;the statutory small tenant created under the second clause of the Bill. These tenants, I understand, are men whose improvements have <i>ex concessis</i> been made for them by their landlords. The noble Lord nods assent to that. In spite of the fact that that is so, they are merely on the ground that their holdings a re below a certain limit of size, to be given a new and extremely privileged position such as has never yet been accorded under any of our legislation in Ireland or elsewhere to tenants whose improvements have been made for them by their landlord. There is no question whatever, I believe, as to that fact. I am bound to say that the noble Lord's proposal is a better one than the proposal in his former Bills. His former Bills would have swept into one net all small holders, whether they had executed their own improvements or not. That proposal was so monstrous&#x2014;that is the only word I can find for it&#x2014;so utterly indefensible, that I am not surprised that His Majesty's Government should have thought it wise not to adhere to it. Having made that admission, I am bound to say that the treatment of this particular class of tenants under the Bill does seem to me, nevertheless, to be extraordinary and indefensible.<lb/>
In all our land legislation hitherto we have kept three objects in view; the stream of our reform has flowed along three well-defined channels. We have, in the first place, attempted to strengthen the position of the tenant who has executed his own improvements and has thereby assumed some of the responsibility which usually belongs to the landlord. In the next place, we have endeavoured to facilitate the creation of new small holdings where there is a genuine demand for them; and, in the third place, we have sought to secure all tenants, no matter where found, against anything which could be termed the confiscation of the improvements they have executed. We are passing now, under the proposal of the noble Lord, entirely outside and beyond any of those principles. What this Bill does&#x2014;outside the crofter areas, remember, and amongst tenants who have Dot executed their own improvements, tenants who, perhaps, have deteriorated their holdings&#x2014;is to give
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0180"/>
<col>351</col>
for the first time fixity of tenure, and fair rents fixed by one of these new-fangled Land Courts. That is, I venture to say, a very violent and extreme proposal. What was the justification of our legislation with regard to Ireland? It was justified entirely by those who belong to the Party opposite upon the ground that in fact Irish tenants were in the habit of making their own improvements. So far is this the case that in Mr. Gladstone's Irish Land Bill there was a clause specially exempting from its provisions those farms upon which it could be shown that the English system had been followed and that the landlord and not the tenant had made the improvements.<lb/>
What is the justification of this new departure? I see it justified&#x2014;I am quoting from, the Lord Advocate&#x2014;upon the ground that "it is necessary to destroy the landlord's right of arbitrary eviction." Have His Majesty's Government any information to give us as to the frequency of cases of such arbitrary eviction? The noble Lord gave us abundant statistics for other purposes. Will be get up presently and tell me that he is able to show the House that it has been a usual thing for Scottish landlords to arbitrarily evict tenants below the limit of this Bill? I believe nothing can be further from the truth. Does the noble Lord suggest, for example, that the refusal of the renewal of a nineteen years lease is an arbitrary eviction? I should say myself that it was not. But supposing the noble Lord thinks otherwise, is it not a much more usual thing that at the end of one of these leases it is the sitting tenant who squeezes the landlord rather than the landlord who squeezes the sitting tenant? No landlord, as far as I am aware, would ever think of gratuitously getting rid of a solvent tenant who paid his rent punctually and treated his land decently. It is all the other way. It is the tenant who says, "Unless you execute improvements for me or improve my position, I will not remain on." There is at least as much pressure on the tenant's side as there is on that of the landlord. And pray let your Lordships not leave out of consideration the fact that supposing the landlord were inclined to take an extreme view and to deal hardly with his tenant in a case of that kind he has, under the Act which we have already placed upon the Statute Book&#x2014;the Act of 1908&#x2014;to pay
<col>352</col>
very heavy compensation to the tenant who is disturbed.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I would like to say one word upon the question of the limit. The limit is a rent of &#x00A3;50 and an area of 50 acres. A 50-acre farm favourably situated may possibly be a farm let at &#x00A3;100 a year. A farm of 60 acres may, on the other hand, be a farm let at, say, &#x00A3;60 a year; and yet under the noble Lord's Bill the man who pays &#x00A3;100 a year gets the advantage of the Bill whereas the man who pays &#x00A3;60 a year does not. The noble Lord will correct me presently if I am wrong. But does the noble Lord seriously intend to defend this limit which he has set up? We have already had quoted the remarkable statement made the other day by the Lord Advocate, who, if I remember right, suggested that, although this limit was in the Bill, the larger tenants had only to ask for its removal in order to obtain it. Is that really what His Majesty's Government intend? Do they mean this limit and do they mean to adhere to it, or is their view the view expressed by the Lord Advocate?<lb/>
One word as to the proposals with regard to the creation of new small holdings. These new small holdings, as my noble friend behind me said very truly, are going to be created mainly at the expense of the sitting tenants. There is no doubt whatever about that. I have more than once in this House ventured to raise my voice for the purpose of imploring the Government to proceed with a certain amount of caution in this policy of a wholesale creation of new small tenants. What they are doing is this. They are going to impose upon all the parties concerned&#x2014;upon the landlords, upon the sitting tenants, upon the labourers and other persons employed in connection with the present farms, upon the ratepayers and the taxpayers of this country&#x2014;a system which has broken down in the past, and which, unless it is handled with the greatest possible care, will break down in the future. What I ask the noble Lord to consider is whether he really is proceeding upon business lines or upon lines of pure philanthropy. Let us distinguish between the two. I am ready to admit that there are cases where we may well allow philanthropy to prevail, cases, <i>e.g.,</i> where you have already on the spot a number of people perhaps leading a very miserable.
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0181"/>
<col>353</col>
existence in a congested district. By all means let us to something to extricate them from their difficulties; by all means let us do what we have done very successfully in Ireland by the action of the Congested Districts Board. But what I am afraid is that where these circumstances do not exist already you are going to create them with your eyes open, and to deliberately lead to their extension in regions where those conditions are at present absent. What did the noble Lord tell us during the course of his speech? He said the great difficulty arose out of the provision of buildings for these new holdings. His words were, "The cost of them is very often prohibitive." We know that is so. If buildings are to be provided in spite of the cost being prohibitive you at once place the whole transaction upon an uneconomical basis. We know what happens. The noble Earl, lately the Minister of Agriculture (Earl Carrington), told us in the summer when we were calling attention to some of his small holdings that he supposed we should have to "cut our losses." That, no doubt, is the recipe which will be resorted to in this case&#x2014;the public will have to cut its losses.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I venture to call attention to the wide difference between the lines upon which you are working in Scotland on this point and the lines upon which you have worked in dealing with this same question in England. What happens in England when it is desired to create small holding? The land is bought or rented by the county council and is then sub-let or resold to the new occupants. The landlord has between himself and the new tenants, as it were as a buffer, the local authority, which relieves him of responsibility and probably, as things go, is not at all a bad tenant. But you are not doing that in Scotland. You are compelling the landlord, as I understand, to accept these small tenancies on his own account. You carve out of his property, or out of the property of his tenants, a small holding upon which you place a man whom the landlord does not know and does not want at a rent fixed arbitrarily by a Court against which there is no appeal, and you compel the owner to accept a rent which can be revised every seven years. You invite the landlord to sit down under that treatment. My Lords, the case is entirely different from the case with which we are
<col>354</col>
familiar in England, and that, after all, is a question of principle.<lb/>
May I say that I heard with satisfaction the intimation made by the noble Lord, in reply to a question by my noble friend Lord Camperdown, as to the position of new tenants who might be created for the first time by any land-owner upon vacant land that happened to be in the owner's possession. Those, he told us, would be altogether outside he scope of this Bill&#x2014;that is to say, they will neither be landholders nor will they be statutory small tenants. That is a satisfactory answer to my noble friend's question. But look at the extraordinary inconsistency in which you are landed. You will have a man to whom a landlord let a small farm let us say five or six years ago on a nineteen years lease. That man becomes a statutory small tenant; there is no doubt about that. A man to whom the same landlord lets another piece of land under exactly similar conditions two years hence will not become a statutory small tenant. I am grateful for small mercies, but if you can sec any consistency in that proposal, I, for one, fail altogether to see it.<lb/>
Much will no doubt depend upon the spirit in which this law is administered, and upon the tribunal which will be called upon to administer it. It is a tribunal which will be entrusted with tremendous powers. Its functions, we were told this evening, are to be strictly judicial&#x2014;those are the noble Lord's words. Its powers will, however, include the power of creating new holdings, of turning existing tenants either into crofters or into statutory small tenants, of fixing fair rents, of fixing the conditions of tenancies, of prohibiting a landlord from dealing with a vacant farm, of awarding compensation without appeal, of permitting assignment to say nothing of the enlargement of holdings, and the conversion of statutory small tenants by a stroke of the pen into landholders with all the privileges of landholders. All those powers are to be exercised without any appeal. The Courts of Law are to be superseded by a tribunal which I should describe as an amateur tribunal&#x2014;a tribunal to my mind wholly devoid of the attributes which we associate with a judicial tribunal. I always regard with suspicion these attempts to oust the Law Courts of the country and to give the powers which naturally and properly belong to them to these <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0182"/>
<col>355</col>
tribunals created deliberately for a political purpose. As one of my noble friends truly said, you may give to the members of a Court of this kind the highest judicial titles you please; you may give them the emoluments of a Judge, you may give them the pensions of a Judge, but you cannot give them the real characteristics or the antecedents of those who fill high judicial places in our Courts of Law, and you never will obtain for them the confidence which our Courts of Law at present enjoy. I much fear that if this Bill becomes law it may greatly disappoint the expectations which may be formed of it. That it will be the means of introducing into the remoter parts of Scotland that expert cultivation of which the noble Lord spoke I entirely disbelieve. But the Bill, n spite of all that, contains a number of proposals which we regard as reasonable and which we are ready to support, and our only regret is that you should have added to them, as we think gratuitously, other proposals full of danger and quite insufficiently thought out. To some of those proposals we shall certainly call your Lordships' attention in Committee, and I can only hope that the conciliatory spirit exhibited by the noble Lord opposite this evening will be displayed again when we arrive at that stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01205"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am loth at this late hour to detain your Lordships for a single moment even in the task which I very readily undertake of answering or attempting to answer some of the questions which have been put during the discussion. The Government have no reason to quarrel with the reception which your Lordships have been good enough to give to this Bill, and on their behalf I readily promise full consideration of all the suggestions which have fallen from the noble Lords who have spoken in the course of this debate. I quite recognise that this Bill is not likely to bring about the millennium, and I accept the rebuke which the noble Marquess offered to me that possibly I may not have connected very closely the facts and figures I gave and the deductions which I wished to draw with the policy of the Bill. Let me say this also. I have registered a solemn vow never again to mention deer forests without most carefully guarding myself against the supposition that wheat might be grown on the slopes of some of our hills in Scotland.<lb/>
<col>356</col>
I quite recognise that this Bill travels over a very large field. If I may be allowed to say so, a great deal of the criticism which has been offered upon the Bill to-night has consisted of an argument against small holdings in any shape or form. Far he it from me to say that all the criticism has taken that form, but a certain amount of it has, and I should like in one sentence to put the position of the Government. We are faced with this great evil of depopulation. It is not disputed that the population of this country is a very valuable national asset, that it provides a most vitalising influence upon the towns of this country; and, on the other hand, it is not disputed, because Census after Census bears it out, that that country population is dwindling fast. That feature is not common to this country alone; it is common to many other countries; but the peculiarity is that in almost every other country they are taking active steps to combat this evil. You may go to Denmark, to Canada, to Belgium, or to France or Hungary, or to any agricultural European country; or you may go even to the great country of the United States of America where they have a much larger proportion of their population living in rural districts. That country is leading the way among the civilised countries of the world in an effort to combat this evil of depopulation. His Majesty's Government have never put forward the notion that this is the specific and the safe remedy for any evil of this kind, but it is a remedy which in the opinion of the Government is worth trying, and which has been tried in every one of those countries to which I alluded just now. We must, if we are to meet this, make some changes.<lb/>
It is inevitable that when you make an adjustment of this kind that the present arrangements must be altered in some respects, and the contention which I venture to lay before your Lordships to-day is that the adjustment outlined in this Bill is the adjustment which most suits the peculiarities and conditions not only of Scottish habits and customs and life but of Scottish land tenure and agriculture, and also that it is the solution which will least interfere with the relations between landlord and tenant. The noble Marquess has asked me how it is we have adopted the limit which is in the Bill of &#x00A3;50. The
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0183"/>
<col>357</col>
answer to that is simply that we have followed the limit of the Small Holdings Act of 1892. It is stated in that Act, which was not passed by the Government of to-day or their predecessors&#x2014;
<quote>"The expression small holding' means a holdiag&#x2014;"</quote>
I am transposing the words&#x2014;
<quote>"which exceeds one acre and either does not exceed 50 acres or, if exceeding 50 acres, does not exceed &#x00A3;50 rent."</quote>
That is the limit which we have adopted, and that is really the reason for adopting the limit which Vs. C put in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01206"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I am anxious to get an answer on this point. Do the Government agree with the Lord Advocate in saying that any one of the larger tenants can get this limit removed if he asks for it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01207"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I will come to that in a minute. In the first place, let me say the reason why we adopted this limit is that it is in the Small holdings Act of 1892. We have simply followed that definition. It is a purely arbitrary definition, as any sum must be. Yon may take 50 or 60 or 100 acres or &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;60 or &#x00A3;100. We have adopted the limit in the Bill because we are legislating for small holdings. There is not only an absence of small holdings in the country but there is an absence of the conditions upon which alone we believe Mad holdings can exist and thrive. We therefore proceed in the Bill to propose security of tenure, upon which can be based that form of activity which is common to small holders in every country&#x2014;co-operation, organisation, clubbing together, and so on. There must he, we believe, in some form conveyed to the small holder by the tenure a sense of security that what he does he is doing for himself and that he will reap the full benefit of his endeavour. In one sense a small holder has less security than the larger tenant, as the noble Lord said. I remember him saying in a debate in this House on similar proposals that it is much more difficult for a landlord to get a good tenant than it is for a tenant to get a farm; but as a matter of fact the larger farmers have a better security of tenure than the small farmers. There is less competition for the larger farms, and
<col>358</col>
there is more risk to a landlord if his large tenant is displaced than if his small tenant is displaced. There is much more competition to fill the place of a small tenant, and therefore this Bill is confined&#x2014;and that is my answer to the noble Lord&#x2014;solely to small holders, their economic position being, in the judgment of the Government, the most vulnerable and the most needing a remedy.<lb/>
As to the position of the statutory small tenants, this portion of the Bill applies to the vast majority of existing small holders in Scotland. In the opinion of the supporters of the both in Parliament and out of it this is a very large and important concession. I quite understand that the critics of the Bill do not think it goes far enough, but, so far as it goes, it applies to the vast majority in every county in Scotland of, so far as I can ascertain, the existing small tenants; for it is the fact that ever since the year 1886, even in the Highland counties, the tendency of landlords has been more and more to make their own improvements, even for the small leaseholders who before that date were hardly distinguishable in that respect from the crofter who was admitted to the benefits of the Crofters Act in 1886. This is a very important concession, and in the opinion of the Government it is the maximum of concession, because we reduce by this concession the security of tenure which is left to these small holders to the very lowest limit. It is not the least good, in the judgment of the Government, to place these small holders on any other basis than sufficient security of tenure to justify and encourage them to group themselves with their neighbours, possibly under another tenure in working out their economic salvation as small farmers. If you impair security of tenure you simply leave them in the existing economic position which time has shown is not sufficient to enable them to make a living.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01208"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt. But does the noble Lord not see this, that the maximum of the concession is entirely done away with so far as we are concerned by the fact that the Lord Advocate declares, on behalf of the Government, that the moment any one of the larger tenants wants it he can get the limit removed, so that there is no concession at all?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0184"/>
<col>359</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01209"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: if people want a thing and it commends itself to public opinion they ultimately get it. But so far as I can ascertain there is no sign of any such demand as the noble Lord suggests. The Lord Advocate expressed his opinion, entirely in accordance with the way in which this country is governed, that if there should be such a demand and it should be supported sufficiently to claim the attention of Parliament, Parliament would at any rate consider it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01210"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Is the judge of the concession to be the House of Commons or the agricultural community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01211"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to differ from my noble friend, but I cannot dive into the future. It is sufficient for me to have this Bill before me, and this Bill is confined, without any further intentions such as those which have been suggested by the noble Marquess, to those with whom it deals. I would say a word, if I may, about the Land Court. The noble Marquess alluded to the Land Court and said it would he engaged in creating new holdings and in turning tenants into landholders or into statutory small tenants. In a sense that may be true; but I would ask the noble Marquess to observe that the only duty which the Land Court would have in such transactions would be to fix fair rents and the compensations to those from whom the land is taken. It is not the duty of the Land Court to initiate such schemes, and so far as clauses can carry it out they are not the Department which can have behind them the stimulus of carrying out the policy of this or any other Government. They are really, in effect, a Court of arbitration, although a judicial Court. I will not argue the point to-night, although there is a great deal to be said against the arguments adduced by the noble Marquess and other noble Lords favouring the employment of arbiters for this purpose.<lb/>
Lord Lovat mentioned forestry, and deplored the fact that no Forestry Commissioner was actually named in this Bill. That is not for the reason that the Govern-
<col>360</col>
ment have a small estimate of the great importance of forestry to Scotland. I can give an assurance now to that effect. It is impossible to label all the Commissioners without making the administrative body so rigid as to leave no room for elastic working; but it is the intention of the Government that there shall be under this Board of Agriculture, as an integral and vital part of its administrative machinery, a department dealing with forestry which shall be developed as the needs of forestry may justify in Scotland, and which shall be fully equipped with competent and efficient advice in the matter.<lb/>
The noble Marquess and other noble Lords have spoken on the subject of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act. I need not repeat the assurance which I have given already on that point. I will only say that I recognise the strong feeling which has been expressed to-night upon that subject. Further, in regard to the Board of Agriculture, I hope that noble Lords will recognise what I said in the earlier part of the evening that in the first place this is a proposal which is based on purely business and administrative lines. It is for purely business and administrative purposes that we wish to set un this Board of Agriculture in Scotland; and we must regard&#x2014;I say this again with emphasis for the reasons which I explained at greater length earlier in the evening&#x2014;we must regard this separate Board of Agriculture as a vital part of the proposals which have been laid before your Lordships to-night. I have not attempted to argue these matters, as it is far from my wish to suggest that the Government are not grateful to the House for the reception which it has been good enough to give to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01217"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> rose "To call attention to the recent negotiations between France and Germany respecting Morocco and consequential questions, and to the action of His Majesty's Ministers in relation thereto, and to move for Papers."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01218">The noble Lord said: My Lords, your Lordships are placed to-night in rather a peculiar, almost, I think, an unprecedented, position. Usually when debates arise on foreign affairs they are simultaneously held in both Houses, and the Ministers charged with the conduct of the business in hand make simultaneous statements and simultaneous speeches are made. But on these ordinary occasions the debates arise upon Papers submitted and upon communications antecedently made, and there is ample material for discussion before the debate begins. On the present occasion, however, we have had to wait for that material until last night's debate elsewhere, and so it becomes necessary, and certainly convenient, that your Lordships should consider on the second day matters which, perhaps, have been discussed and first fruit tasted before coming to your Lordships' consideration. But it appears to me that there remains a good deal to be said and a good deal that must be said. I trust, your Lordships will excuse me if I venture therefore to resume, as it must in some measure be a resumption,
<col>362</col>
the debate begun elsewhere, and I crave in advance the toleration of your Lordships if I am found using unexpected or unaccustomed words in connection with the debate now about to begin.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01219">I propose to confine my observations exclusively to the negotiations that recently took place between France and Germany respecting Morocco, the questions consequently arising in the course of those negotiations, by which I mean practically the questions familiarly known as compensation, and the action of His Majesty's Government in relation thereto. I shall not enter into any other matter of foreign policy, except perhaps in a most cursory way to refer to an incident as it may come to illustrate my general observations. In these discussions we have to refer back to the Treaty of 1904 and the Act of Algeciras. When the discussions began between the two great Continental Powers the Prime Minister in another place, speaking of our position, said that we were concerned in respect of the maintenance of Treaty obligations and in reference to the defence of our own interests. These things are apt to be very much interwoven. I think they have been in the consideration of these negotiations very much intermixed. It is well that we should separate them one from the other, and consider, if we can, what are our Treaty obligations and what are the interests which have been involved in these discussions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01220">On July 18 I put a Question to my noble friend the Leader of the House as to whether he could lay on the Table Papers showing our Treaty obligations in respect to Morocco. I regret that that Question was not pursued and made the commencement of discussion. I think it would have been useful if occasion had been taken to examine pretty strictly what our Treaty obligations were. My noble friend replied to me that they were confined in two documents&#x2014;the Treaty of 1904 and the Act of Algeciras; and he left me to discover from them what were our Treaty obligations to France in respect of Morocco. No doubt that was an easy way of disposing of the difficulty, but I think it might have been of more use, in reference to the state of public opinion and perhaps to the controversy which arose, if your Lordships had seized the occasion to examine into the precise
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0186"/>
<col>363</col>
character of the Treaty obligations contained in the two documents to which I have referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01221">Now what was the genesis and what the character of the Treaty of 1904. We had had outstanding difficulties with France, some enduring for a long time, not always chronically active, but appearing and reappearing at intervals, and frequently very vexatious in character. There was, for example, the difficulty with France, arising from the Treaty of Utrecht, on the question of the shores of Newfoundland. The Treaty of 1904 practically settled all our difficulties with France and established what has been called an <i>entente,</i> but which I prefer to describe, using the language of the Foreign Secretary, as a cordial friendship between ourselves and France. It was an escape from difficulties which before had beset us and which occasionally were urgent. The Foreign Secretary, for instance, has said that not long before that Treaty a difficulty arose between us and France in respect to Siam which threatened some peril of war. Speaking of it last night he used an expression which I cannot help, in passing, taking notice of. It would be humorous if it were not a pathetic revelation of what may be called our constant attitude. He said we were in peril of a war about Siam. Viewed in the light of what has since happened, a war such as we then had in prospect about Siam would have been a madness and a crime. My Lords, how many wars, viewed in the light of what happened a few years afterwards, would not seem to calm observers to be at once a madness and a crime? This comparatively petty discussion which has had such results in irritating one nation, if not two nations, in which we have been engaged during the last two or three months, viewed in the light of two or three years hence will scarcely be serious enough, perhaps, to be characterised as a madness and a crime, but surely will come to be regarded as a futility. It is the part of a statesman to attempt to forecast the future so as not to allow years to pass before correctly estimating the character of the controversy which threatens to provoke war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01222">Now I come to the settlement of 1904 which removed the difficulties between us and France. How was it produced, and how was it received? With the
<col>364</col>
single exception of the noble Earl who usually sits on the Cross Benches, I think it was received with approbation by every person engaged in political life in this country. And Lord Rosebery himself, though he expressed his dissatisfaction with it, did not, I think, at the time enter into any complaint about it, and what he has since said seemed to indicate that his anxiety about it arose from the fact that it might in the future present France and ourselves <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> as dominating Powers on opposite sides of the Straits of Gibraltar. If that is the danger he apprehended, it has yet to come. It is not out of that view of the Treaty that any difficulty has arisen. The Treaty, as I say, was received by everybody else with acclamation as removing all these difficulties, petty or considerable, which had so long existed between us and France, and as opening up a new prospect for the future; and we rejoice to know, my Lords, that that prospect, as far as France is concerned, has been fulfilled. As was said by the Foreign Secretary last night, seven years have tried that Treaty, and we have remained friends with France throughout. There has been a cordial friendship, a friendship accompanied with tolerance and goodwill, without which qualities I suspect no friendship is possible between, individuals or nations. We hailed it with satisfaction, and we hailed it also as an illustration of what might be expected to be achieved in reference to our relations to other countries. It was not to stand alone. Having thus cleared the way with France, we might go on and clear our relations with other neighbours, and so establish a harmony which should extend throughout Europe, and, indeed, possibly beyond the bounds of Europe. And it has been done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01223">We accomplished&#x2014;not the late Government who achieved the Treaty of 1904, but the present Government, following up the inclinations if not the preparations of the noble Marquess opposite&#x2014;we accomplished a Treaty of friendship with Russia which removed similar occasions of difficulty and discord and has laid the foundations of a friendship between us and Russia. Then, my Lords, that was accompanied with the treatment of some subjects involving difficulties and very nice management, and it may be that that Treaty has not quite fulfilled all that we had hoped from it; but it at all events served for some time
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0187"/>
<col>365</col>
to remove difficulties that had existed between Russia and ourselves, and to maintain that tolerance and goodwill which I, for one, would extend to Russia as much as to France or any other country. I hope we may see that Treaty in spirit and in letter continuously maintained. What was done with respect to ourselves and the United States? There also a movement has been made, consequential I think I may say on the Treaty of 1904, towards bringing our relations to the United States into perfect clearness, freed from the many difficulties respecting boundaries, fishery rights, and other causes of dispute between us which appeared and reappeared through many years. These were consequent upon the Treaty of 1904, and in fulfilment of the hope in which that Treaty was produced and the expectations which that Treaty excited; and I ask your Lordships to consider whether there has been, whether there is, any reason why what was done with France, what was done with Russia, what we may say has been achieved with the United States, should not, also be done between us and Germany? Cannot we, in relation to Germany, enter into a similar condition of cordial friendship? Can we not in our dealings with that great Power show something of the same tolerance and goodwill which has made the maintenance of the French understanding so firm and so trustworthy? I ask your Lordships to consider whether it would not have been really a fulfilment of your own expectations when you received with gladness that settlement of the difficulties with France that before this we should have concluded a similar Treaty with Germany?</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01224">The Treaty with France was one between us and our neighbours mainly in respect of Morocco and in respect of Egypt. It was of a strictly limited character. It began with the declaration that the independence of Morocco was not to be dealt with, it was to be maintained; but as friends of the French and having newly established friendly relations with France we recognised that France as a conterminous Power had peculiar interests in Morocco, and we undertook to lend France diplomatic support&#x2014;the adjective was not used unwarily&#x2014;in extending that influence, in policing the conterminous area, and in developing the resources and trade of Morocco, always, however, without the introduction of any un-
<col>366</col>
equal commercial treatment. That was all. There was a similar agreement&#x2014;a reciprocal agreement&#x2014;on the part of France towards ourselves in respect of Egypt, but our agreement was strictly limited to lending diplomatic support to France in relation to the limited subjects I have named. There was no agreement to do anything beyond diplomatic action, and no agreement to extend that diplomatic action beyond the sphere of supporting France in policing the border and in developing the resources of Morocco subject to the condition of equal commercial treatment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01225">The Treaty between us and France with respect to Morocco could not, of course, affect the rights or interests of any other Power in Morocco. It was a Treaty between ourselves, and binding only upon ourselves. It could not touch the rights or interest of third parties. There was some delay in communicating it to third parties, though one scarcely knows how that arose. Umbrage was taken at that delay, and it was signified by Germany that we and France could not arrange the fortunes of Morocco without considering the rights and interests of outside Powers, and that Morocco, in fact, concerned, other Powers besides France and Great Britain. The Conference of Algeciras was called, which resulted in the Act of Algeciras. It was the second Treaty to which my noble friend below me referred. And what was the character of the Act of Algeciras? My Lords, it affirmed the independence and integrity of the Empire of Morocco. That was affirmed as a thing not to be touched. It made that the interest of united Europe. Instead of being a matter of interest to France and ourselves alone, it became the part of the Concert of Europe to regard and maintain that independence and integrity, and it went on to lay down provisions, subject to that independence, for the development of the trade, the resources, the mines of Morocco, and for the organisation of its police; and all these regulations were most strictly coupled with provisions for the equal treatment of all Powers in respect of commerce with Morocco.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01226">Your Lordships will sec that the Act of Algeciras made the condition of Morocco a matter of European concern, and so far it superseded and made of little account the Treaty of 1904. No doubt that Treaty remained technically alive, but its provisions
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0188"/>
<col>367</col>
ceased to be of paramount importance when the Act of Algeciras was agreed upon. That Act was a later document; it affected a larger number of Powers; and our relations with France itself became subject to the conditions which France and ourselves entered into with respect to those other Powers. From that time the Act of Algeciras ought to have been regarded, as it strictly was, as the charter, the dominant charter, of the condition of Morocco, and anything that was attempted to be done by way of change within Morocco ought to have been pursued with a single eye&#x2014;in the main, at all events&#x2014;upon the Act of Algeciras. Unfortunately, as I think, the conduct of our Foreign Office leads to the view that the Act of Algeciras was little thought of, and our obligations under the Treaty of 1904 were much thought of. We magnified those Treaty obligations where they were exceedingly little, and we neglected to consider the character of the Act of Algeciras in its bearing on the condition of Morocco. If that had been kept steadily in mind, if our relation to Morocco and the relation of other Powers to Morocco in the light of the Act of Algeciras had been kept steadily in mind, we should, I think, have avoided all, or almost all, the difficulties that have arisen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01227">Now why do I say that if we had kept the Act of Algeciras steadily in mind we should have avoided most of the difficulties that have happened The Act of Algeciras put the independence and integrity of Morocco under European control. All the Powers were united in declaring that it was a matter of concern to them. Directly, therefore, our friends in France took any action which in any way led up to, or threatened to lead up to, an interference with the integrity and independence of Morocco, that action on the part of France was derogatory to, hostile to, the conditions of the Act of Algeciras; and as friends of France, as bound by these cordial relations which have existed, it would have been easy, it would have been becoming, it would have saved a great deal of trouble, and it would have saved us and France from a false position, if we had pointed out in the most friendly way that steps which threatened the independence of Morocco on the part of France must occasion questions on the part of other Powers who are parties to the Act of Algeciras, and that if France insisted that such infringements or preparations for infringement of independence
<col>368</col>
and integrity were permitted, it would be beyond our power to withstand complaints. We should have had no valid reason for saying there was not ground for complaint in that the Act of Algeciras was threatened. But we did little; we did nothing; we allowed the matter to drift.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01228">Germany entered into conversations with France with respect to these threatened, these probable, attacks on the integrity and independence of Morocco, and we stood by. Indeed, as far as one can discover, it was not until in pursuit of the conversations between Germany and France the "Panther" was despatched to Agadir that we woke up. Then we began to be interested. It was apparent then&#x2014;it ought to have been apparent before&#x2014;that something was done which might interfere with the. Act of Algeciras. It ought to have been apparent before that if anything was to be done with respect to that Act, the Powers of Europe must be allowed to say their say about it. The Powers of Europe had, by the consent of them all, taken Morocco in hand. But nothing was done until the appearance of the "Panther" at Agadir, and then, as I say, we woke up. Then it appeared to be considered that our Treaty obligations or our interests were at stake. Treaty obligations, my Lords&#x0021; It would be difficult to find how those were in any way in peril by that action, except so far as we were, like other Powers who were parties to the Act of Algeciras, bound to maintain the integrity of Morocco, and so ought to have been co-partners with Germany in protesting against an alteration in the <i>status</i> of Morocco to which the other Powers were not parties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01229">As for interests, I boldly face that question. What is the question of interests raised by the despatch of the "Panther" to Agadir? We were told that the ship went there because certain Germans were alarmed as to person and property, and the ship was sent to protect them, if necessary, against maltreatment. But take it as far as your imagination can go. Take it that the appearance of the "Panther" at Agadir was the first step towards a possible partition of Morocco, in which Germany would have possibly a port on the Atlantic coast, and France would have possibly another port. I ask here whether our interests were really involved in the question supposing a protectorate were to be
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0189"/>
<col>369</col>
established, whether the protectorate be vested in one Power or another Power, or supposing that one portion of the country should be under the protectorate of one Power and another portion under the protectorate of another Power. My Lords, our duty was, if possible, to maintain the integrity of Morocco as a whole. Our interest was to insist that, whatever changes happened, the commercial treatment of all countries should be equal, that the open door should be maintained. All these things we might have insisted upon, but we did not. All our action took the form of backing up France in the conversations that followed, of accepting French statements and viewing everything through French spectacles, and whereas Morocco under the Treaty of Algeciras was made a matter of European concern, we took the extraordinary position of maintaining, as it were, against Germany the position of France in Morocco. Well, my Lords, that is something that could not be maintained, and if we look substantially at the question of interest, I reaffirm the statement that as a matter of interest it was to us immaterial which one of two Powers should occupy a portion of the coast of Morocco supposing that it was necessary&#x2014;and it was not necessary&#x2014;that that coast should pass under the control of one or the other or of both Powers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01230">I do not propose to follow the very intricate and interwoven course of negotiations that followed. Our Government thought it necessary on July 3, through the Foreign Secretary, to tell the German Ambassador that the despatch of the "Panther" to Agadir made a new departure, and on the 4th, after a Cabinet meeting, the Foreign Secretary communicated the opinion of the Cabinet that it did constitute a new departure. No inquiry was made at that time of the German Ambassador or of the German Government. A statement was made that in the opinion of His Majesty's Government a new position had been taken&#x2014;a statement which no doubt invited some response and some explanation, which, unhappily, did not appear to be forthcoming. But the truth appears to have been that the German Government went on conducting their negotiations with the French Government apart. It did turn out some few days later that there was no intention to bring in any third party. They went on conducting their negotiations apart, and Germany, to
<col>370</col>
outward appearances, may seem to have said, "We take note of what has been said, but inasmuch as there is no new departure whatever we have nothing further to say. Things must go on as they were." There are difficulties in the diplomacy of Germany as of other Powers, and I confess I think it much to be regretted that a clear statement was not made then on the part of Germany as to the real intention and limitation&#x2014;a difficult statement to make, I admit, even with the most perfect honesty on the part of Germany&#x2014;of the conduct of the "Panther" at Agadir. A difficult statement, because circumstances may require such development that what is started with one idea may lead to the adoption of another idea. But it would have been wise if a communication had been made consequent upon the intimation of July 4.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01231">It is confessed that none was made; and on July 21 the Foreign Secretary sent for the German Ambassador and had a conversation&#x2014;a somewhat warm conversation&#x2014;with him. We had a report of that conversation first of all through a communication made by the German Foreign Secretary to a Committee of the Reichstag. I confess that when I read that I felt that there must surely be some considerable misunderstanding if not misrepresentation, some negligence in the statement of the case, because our Foreign Secretary was represented as expressing a strong opinion that the demands made by Germany were unacceptable, that there was a reason for apprehension that the whole negotiations would break down, and other declarations of a similar character. I said to myself when I read this statement, surely the Foreign Secretary could not have gone further than have said, "We understand certain things to be asked which seem to us very unlikely to be accepted, and perhaps it is worth considering whether they can possibly be accepted and what will be the consequence of their rejection." But that our Foreign Secretary should summon the German Ambassador to his presence and tell him that demands had been made which were unacceptable I felt to be quite beyond what would be expected of the Foreign Secretary. But apparently this language was quite accurate. The Foreign Secretary himself now admits that this was the language which he employed in speaking to the German Ambassador. It was the language of France, not our language. How could we say what was
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0190"/>
<col>371</col>
unacceptable and what was not unacceptable with respect to a revision of territory in the Congo Basin? How could we lay down beforehand the possibility or otherwise of the acceptance of these proposals? We could only do so secondhand, and only by seeing what was going on through French spectacles, and only by making ourselves partisans of France. The friendship had become a partial affection, and we were taking the line of partisans in that interview.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01232">The German Ambassador left the Foreign Secretary, and it was evident that some further communication would be made. He had after that interview to communicate with his Government and bring back an answer to the observations of the Foreign Secretary; and, in fact, that course was taken. The German Ambassador did send home a report and he got a reply. But before the reply came another thing had happened, to me the most inexplicable act in the whole of this singular drama. After that conversation on the afternoon of July 21 the Foreign Secretary saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was going to meet the bankers in the City, and the Foreign Secretary, with the approval, I am sorry to add, of the Prime Minister, apparently wrote down something which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to say to the bankers in the City. I confess that was to me, and remains, wholly inexplicable. The resources of diplomacy were not exhausted. The matter was in course of diplomatic treatment. We had received no rebuff which made it necessary to go into the streets and utter our complaint. The matter was still in course of strict diplomatic treatment when this statement was given to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer went into the City and made his speech. His was not a very apt fulfilment of the mission so confided to him. It was not his fault so far as one could see, even if it were proper that such a step should be taken. But it was quite unnecessary that such a step should be taken. It was quite unnecessary that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should say anything about the matter; but if he were bound to refer to it, it would have been quite easy to have employed diplomatic language similar to that which Germany herself had employed with reference to the Treaty of
<col>372</col>
1904&#x2014;to wit, that though Morocco was the subject of conversation as between Germany and France, and possibly certain proposals had been made by one side to the other and were still under discussion, still Morocco since the Act of Algeciras was a matter of European concern, and it was impossible for two parties to the European compact to enter into new relations apart altogether from the consent and approval of the other parties; and therefore we would wait because we knew that in due course, as on a former occasion, whatever was tentatively agreed upon between Germany and France must come before the Concert of Europe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01233">But instead of a speech of that kind, which could have been made without, difficulty, without causing irritation, without offence, the Chancellor of the Exchequer went into the City and made what may be coiled a shrill outcry of slighted self-importance, not a dignified thing at all, and of which I confess as an Englishman I did not feel at all proud as the utterance of a representative of His Majesty's Government in respect to a matter of international concern. I do not wish to dwell upon this question of the Chancellor of the Exchequer too much. He probably has not too many friends in this House, and it would be unfair to blame him entirely for what was his first essay, so far as I know, in diplomatic affairs; but it was a deplorable essay, for which excuse seems to be difficult to discover, for which no precedent can be offered, and which provoked the deepest ill-feeling, not merely on the part of the German Government&#x2014;I do not know what their feelings were; they were apparently more or less impervious&#x2014;but, what concerns me more, on the part of the German people, and for the first time we were in real peril of something like a warlike feeling springing up between the two nations because of the embittered sense of wrong which got amongst the German people through this utterance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We know, in point of fact, that it was the natural consequence of that speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the communications made by the German Ambassador to the satisfaction of our Government that Germany contemplated no acquisition of land in Morocco were refused to be allowed to be treated otherwise than as confidential, because if we realise the situation we shall see that if that had been given out at that
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0191"/>
<col>373</col>
moment as a thing happening the day after Mr. Lloyd George's speech the feeling in Germany towards their Government, which became manifested afterwards in the Reichstag on the part of certain politicians, would have been pretty nearly universal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01234">Happily we have got over the difficulty. There is a sobriety amongst diplomats and other people which makes them sometimes recoil from following words up with deeds, and as a consequence we did in the end get an agreement established much the same as had been projected apparently from the first between France and Germany with respect to certain possessions in the Basin of the Congo, and Morocco was left free from the peril which had been thrown over her. Had we been faithful to our proper position as a party to the Act of Algeciras we should never have got into that difficulty, and when we got out of it of course our proper act should have been to revert to our position as a party to that Treaty and have rejoiced in the settlement. There is one observation in reference to this twisted and tortuous course of diplomacy which I must venture to make. The resources of civilisation, as I have said, were not exhausted. Supposing the conversations had failed, supposing a deadlock had ensued, still Morocco would have remained a matter of European concern, and still there would have been a possibility of acting upon the suggestion that very properly occurred to the Foreign Secretary of a European Conference to take into consideration the new situation, as a European Conference had taken into consideration the old at Algeciras. But that suggestion was thrown out whilst the negotiations were still pending, and, as a matter of course, the answer to the suggestion was that when made it might not be accepted. When people are engaged in one course of procedure endeavouring to settle in a particular fashion difficulties which have arisen, to enter into their company and say, "Supposing this plan fails, shall we adopt something else?" is to propose something which is certainly ill-timed, and most certainly at that moment would be dismissed as for the moment unacceptable. When failure was accomplished it would be natural to come forward with the suggestion for a conference. But to come forward with that suggestion beforehand is, I conceive, leading up to a rebuff. You must expect to be told that the suggestion is premature
<col>374</col>
and could not be considered at that moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01235">We may all rejoice, we do all rejoice, that at length the difficulty was got over. I myself never shared the extreme anxiety of those who thought at one time that we might be at war the next day, but we were in a very bad situation, and in a very bad situation because we had forgotten our proper position, and instead of being, with the other European Powers, protectors of Morocco under the Act of Algeciras, we had become, in pursuit of the supposed obligations of a Treaty, partisans of France in respect of its negotiations. But the thing is over, and, as the Chancellor to the German Empire said, there is a clean slate. My Lords, I would like us to take our stand upon that position. Let the dead past remain dead. But shall we be able to secure that offer of a clean slate. The pain, the grief, that I feel in respect of the situation is that that offer appears unlikely to lead to any immediate, if to any, result. We have not secured the clean slate; we cannot secure the clean slate unless we are prepared to do that which I suggested might have been done after the Treaty with France and after the Treaty with Russia were achieved&#x2014;to do that with Germany which we have done with them, to enter into a relation of cordial friendship with Germany, reviewing all possible causes of discontent and entering upon a course of conduct marked with that tolerance and goodwill on the part of ourselves and of Germany which have deepened the friendship of France and England during the last seven years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01236">Was there perceptible in the speech of the Foreign Secretary any desire, any dream of a possibility of entering into with Germany a similar Treaty to that into which we have entered with France? We were told by the Prime Minister&#x2014;I am glad of the words&#x2014;that our friendship with France is not exclusive; it admits of friendship with other countries. Those are good words which I wish to press. But the acts of the Foreign Secretary have made that friendship exclusive, and the words of the Foreign Secretary would rather prove that that friendship must remain exclusive. He showed no disposition whatever in the other direction. On the contrary, if his words can be
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0192"/>
<col>375</col>
trusted, it would seem that he holds the belief that it is impossible to establish with Germany a state of cordial friendship marked with mutual tolerance and goodwill such as has been established with France. Why does he not make the offer? Why not go back to that position of being friends of all, friends of Germany as of France, and not partial friends? The Foreign Secretary's conception is that of a divided Europe, not of a united Europe. He lost sight of the Act of Algeciras which placed Morocco under European control. I regret to say that in his vision Europe consists of certain Powers which must be massed in two camps. We may treat with civility those in the opposite camp, but it is essential that division and balance should be maintained; and the notion of a complete agreement, a unity of Christendom, a family of nations, a concert of Europe&#x2014;these are things which he seems rather to have regarded as impossible in the situation of Europe as it is. He made scorn of the old vision of complete aloofness, of nonintervention, which I do not think is held now by many persons. I myself have never held to the possibility of non-intervention in the affairs of Europe on the part of this country. It seems to me that in European affairs each State has its duties as each citizen within a State has his duties, and just as no citizen can disrobe himself of his duties as a citizen so no European Power can renounce and make nought its duties as a European Power. But this conception is not antagonistic. On the contrary, it is in perfect harmony with the suggestions that the different Powers of Europe might be united together in one family, making the affairs of Europe very largely a matter of general and mutual concern.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01237">Consider at this moment&#x2014;I put it by way of illustration&#x2014;what has happened from the disunion which has been the result of the interpretation put upon the Anglo-French Treaty by the Foreign Secretary. We do not want to enter into the merits of the underlying controversy; but, my Lords, you must surely feel that no act of our time, of our generation, has been so fatal to the dignity and authority of international law as the commencement of the war between Italy and Turkey. Nothing has been so fatal to the dignity and authority of international law, and that offence would have been impossible had the Concert of Europe
<col>376</col>
been maintained. This much we may say is certain, that Italy would not have taken the step, however justified that step might be in its ultimate concern&#x2014;I pass no judgment on that&#x2014;had not she been conscious that with England and Germany divided as they were there was no risk of interference. Had they been united, without a shot fired or deed done the enterprise would have been checked in its very inception.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01238">Now, my Lords, the lesson to be derived from what has gone on for the last two or three months is that the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;the foreign policy of this Government&#x2014;should be animated by a new conception of international duty; that it should not be inspired by that notion of the balance of power which has been the bogey of successive generations and which has been made a mockery in the light of subsequent years. What we want is a conception of international duty and a foreign policy based on the alliance and the federation of the Powers of Europe in one body dealing with European concerns&#x2014;not in the estrangement and allocation of those Powers into two camps, balancing one another, and keeping one another quiet by an exhibition of their great forces. Is this an impossible conception? Is this a matter which a Foreign Secretary should dismiss as a chimerical and quixotic dream? My Lords, I look back a very few years to the time when the seals of the Foreign Office were held by the commanding personality of Lord Salisbury. What was the main principle of Lord Salisbury's foreign policy? It was the maintenance of the European Concert. We sometimes fretted that that policy moved so slowly. It always will move slowly. But the Concert of Europe is a guarantee of European peace compared with which your calculations of the relative strength of this or that combination are idle and frivolous. It is to a European Concert between all nations, and to that alone, that we can look for a restoration of right feeling in European politics.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01239">It is a matter of pain and grief that the Foreign Secretary, with all his charm of personality and all his gifts, should be apparently dead to this conception. What was his attitude last night? It was cold, deadly, correct. The friend of Germany, yes; but warning them not to be too aggressive&#x2014;a warning which did not come
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0193"/>
<col>377</col>
with a better grace because it was preceded by a confession that we were gorged to the full and could swallow no more. A warning not to be too aggressive&#x0021; This is the conception of meeting the offer of the clean slate This is the vision of division instead of union which negatives the restoration of true European fooling and good-will. Lord Salisbury, as I say, made this the main principle of his policy, and I think we may look to its being revived again as the main principle of the policy of the Foreign Secretary to come. I caught the accent, the great accent, of such a policy only last week in the speech delivered at Bath, not by a member of the Cabinet, but by one of the youngest members of the Government who, however, is exceeded in authority and character by none, and who, I venture to hope, in a short time will be admitted within the innermost councils of the Sovereign. In his message from the common folk of Great Britain to the common folk of Germany he called them the kindred race, and he spoke of their kindred ideals, their kindred career, and kindred progress. Sir John Simon made an invitation, made a response if you like, to offers of friendship on the other side which could not but thrill every German in whatever part of the Fatherland he might be. It is in such appeals, made in such a spirit and in such a spirit alone, that we can look for a real restoration of the peace of Christendom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01240">I am sorry I have to speak so firmly, so rigidly, as I have been compelled to do, but I think the occasion requires very plain speaking; and the greater our respect for the personal character of the Foreign Secretary, the more we are attracted to him by his grace and charm, the more are we bound to express our dissent from the policy which we trace not only in his words but in every deed of his official career, and we are bound to express a hope that that false conception of foreign policy which is the embodiment of that spirit may disappear from the councils of this nation. My Lords, I beg to move.</p>

But the whole range of questions that he has raised to-night cannot be judged unless you follow them out, I was going to say for hour after hour, into detail, and it is not a desirable way of presenting a set of questions, which I agree to be of momentous importance, to take two or three points. Perhaps he had not the time to go through all the details, but he might have left some of those points, at any rate, out, because they are only intelligible in relation to a whole set of categories of detail.<lb/>
Then as to his language about the Foreign Secretary, is it not a painful irony that it seems only a few weeks ago&#x2014;it is perhaps six months ago&#x2014;since Sir Edward Grey quickened the pulse and kindled the hopes and the imagination&#x2014;peaceful hopes and peaceful imagination&#x2014;not only of this country, but of Europe and the United States, and that Sir Edward Grey did that by the spirit in which he addressed the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0194"/>
<col>379</col>
House of Commons on some day or another in March when they were discussing Army Estimates? The Foreign Secretary on that occasion, in I noble passage, not very long but full of importance, begged the House to recognise that the only real and sure relief against the rising flood of military and naval armaments would come&#x2014;How? When nations did what individuals have done&#x2014;that is, recognise that in cases of difference they should regard an appeal to law as against an appeal to force as the true remedy and relief. He said that when nations came to regard an appeal to law as the natural course, just as individuals do, then indeed, though it might be Utopian and, as he said, might be called visionary, that was the natural remedy. These are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"The minds of men are working on arbitration, and if you look back into history you will find there some favourable moments when public opinion has risen to heights which only a generation before seemed impossible."</quote>
Well, my Lords, I think it is rather hard that a Minister who has used language of that kind should be so attacked. Sir Edward Grey knows as well as any man can how slow, how unsteady advance is; yet I say the man who made that appeal to the spirit of pacific negotiation cannot fairly be attacked in the way he has just been attacked. On that point I would only mention the sincere gratification with which we found, only last night, the new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons using language which any of us who have, been scouted for years and years as Little Englanders, and I know not what else, might have used. Mr. Bonar Law said&#x2014;
<quote>"We shall never show ourselves" [the Party opposite, that is] "anxious to prevent Germany from becoming a greater nation than she is; and for ourselves we desire no acquisition of territory, no extension of our Imperial obligations."</quote>
He said, and I believe with perfect and absolute truth&#x2014;
<quote>"I am speaking not only for myself and not only for my Party, but I am speaking for the whole nation; and I am perfectly certain, and nobody I think in this House or anywhere else would deny, that all the language used of a friendly character to Germany carries with it the feeling of the whole, nation,"</quote>
My noble friend went briefly into the history of the Convention of 1904, of which the author was the noble Marquess opposite. What he said was perfectly
<col>380</col>
true, that that Convention was received with universal assent and applause. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in the House of Commons said the country viewed it with intense satisfaction, and both the noble Marquess opposite and Sir Edward Grey used language which implied that there was to be, or that they hoped there would be an extended application of the method and purpose of the French <i>Entente.</i> The noble Marquess said, and his language is worth recalling&#x2014;
<quote>"These Agreements deal with questions of the most complicated description, and I hope the arrangements come to in this case may be usefully followed in our dealings with other Powers."</quote>
Sir Edward Grey said&#x2014;
<quote>"This <i>Entente</i> with France will be a working model in other cases."</quote>
There was only one voice, as my noble friend reminded us, hostile to the <i>Entente</i> of 1901, and that, as he said, was the voice of Lord Rosebery, who had been Foreign Secretary and therefore spoke with authority, and his view was a view not to be left out of account. He used very extreme language, as I think, about the Convention of 1904. He said that he had the mournful and supreme conviction that it was a dangerous and needless concession, and that no more one-sided Agreement was ever concluded between two great Powers. He gave a reason. He said he hoped and trusted that the Power which holds Gibraltar might never have cause to regret having handed Morocco over to a great military Power. But all the same he (Lord Rosebery) was as glad as other people that the Convention had been made.<lb/>
One remark I see made about the Convention is that the <i>Entente</i> of 1904 between England and France was in truth an anti-German alliance. The noble Marquess is better able than I am to defend himself from any imputation of that sort; but it is perfectly obvious to anybody who has followed the foreign policy of Lord Salisbury and of the noble Marquess when Lord Salisbury had abandoned the helm&#x2014;it is perfectly clear, from the concessions made to Germany, that no Foreign Secretary ever held office more intent upon preserving good terms and a good understanding with Germany than the Government of Lord Salisbury in which the noble Marquess was Foreign Secretary. Do not let us forget that one of the most powerful
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0195"/>
<col>381</col>
members of that Government was Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Chamberlain said&#x2014;
<quote>"The natural alliance is between ourselves and the great German Empire"</quote>
Therefore it is ridiculous to say that the authors of the <i>Entente</i> of 1904 had any kind of hostility to Germany in their minds. I am sure that the noble Marquess will support that contention.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me came naturally to the Algeciras Act, and he used the phrase that the Algeciras Act superseded the <i>Entente</i> Agreement. I do not think it superseded it at all. It developed it, and opened a new chapter that might be fairly considered consequential upon it. When my noble friend says that we neglected it, I really do not know&#x2014;and I listened with the utmost attention to him&#x2014;in reference to the Algeciras Act what he is criticising the action of. His Majesty's Government upon. I fail to get the thread of that. But there was. no doubt, by the Algeciras Act a development of great importance. As my noble friend said, it did recognise, in a way that had not been done in the <i>Entente</i> Agreement, the share of a number of small and great Powers. Whether that be wise or not I do not undertake to say. But the Algeciras Act. and its circumstances, though not very old, have long since passed away from people's minds as one of those ephemeral incidents which, common enough in international relations, require most careful and attentive watching by those who are responsible for the conduct of international affairs. I do not admit that this Government since the year 1905 has been guilty of any offence whatever in the way of neglecting the full bearing of either the <i>Entente</i> or the Algeciras Act. Now I want to ask my noble friend this. He used condemnatory language of the <i>Entente</i> as we have interpreted it. I am sure he does not wish us to denounce, or cause to be denounced, that Agreement, or in any way to fail to undertake our full share in upholding its terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01245"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01246"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: That, of course, would be impossible. If anybody has such an idea&#x2014;and I have seen language in the Press which implies that that idea is not entirely absent from some minds, or substitutes for minds&#x2014;I would venture
<col>382</col>
to put this point. What is the pith of the <i>Entente</i>? It-was an Agreement that England, putting it shortly and plainly, should have a free hand in Egypt, and France was to have a free hand in Morocco. We have had our share in the profits of that great transaction, if profits they be, as to which I for one&#x2014;I am not speaking for the Government&#x2014;have always had some doubts. But still we have had whatever profits there may be, or may not be, in the case of Egypt; and it would be intolerable that we should now, after taking our own share of the profits, in any way refuse to give France her full share too. There is such a thing as honour, surely, in all these international obligations. I remember a Judge saying once, "Honour is a great national interest"; and hope we shall not forget&#x2014;I am sure nobody in this House, no responsible man will forget&#x2014;the honour that is involved in maintaining that Treaty. But that does not in the least prevent our expanding it, as the noble-Marquess when the Treaty was made hoped might be done.<lb/>
My Lords, I am not going to repeat to your Lordships to-night the long exposition of fact and narrative which the Foreign Secretary last night gave to the House of Commons. It would be idle. He has an authority which I do not pretend to, and he performed the task with a lucidity which I think has commanded admiration even from those who, like my noble friend, find some of the practical conclusions cold, or chilly, or whatever the word is. My noble friend said that Mr. Lloyd George had no friends in this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01247"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: I said not many.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01248"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: Well, I am one of them. I admit that there may be those who believe that it would have been better if the important declaration which was made to the bankers at the Mansion House had been made through the ordinary diplomatic channels. That is a position that may be taken up. But the Government were of another opinion. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were of another opinion, and the speech was made. I wonder&#x2014;if it is not impertinent&#x2014;hew many of your Lordships have really read that speech or the operative portion of it. It is not very
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0196"/>
<col>383</col>
long, and I will not read it all, but the operative part is short enough. It is this&#x2014;
<quote>"I conceive that nothing would justify a disturbance of international goodwill except questions of the gravest national moment. But if a situation were to be forced upon us in which peace could only be preserved by the surrender of the great and beneficent position Great Britain has won by centuries of heroism and achievement, by allowing Britain to be of no account in the cabinet of nations, then I say emphatically that peace at that price ' would be a humiliation intolerable for a great country like ours to endure."</quote>
I know quite well, of course, that the mere words of a speech are not to be construed without regard to the conditions under which they were spoken, the persons to whom they were spoken, and the persons about whom they were spoken. That is quite true. But the reasons given last night by the Foreign Secretary, with which your Lordships are now familiar, seem to me to be a fair answer to the alarm of my noble friend, and the condemnation which he has bestowed upon that speech. I for my part, at all events, think that my noble friend has not said anything which really damages or contradicts any single word which was used by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on that occasion.<lb/>
Now I am not one of those who think there is no real conflict of interests between England and Germany, trade rivalries, and so forth, but this I do say&#x2014;and here I am sure I shall have my noble friend with me&#x2014;that that conflict is not a conflict that can possibly be averted or opposed or conducted to a hopeful issue either by war or the shock of battle or by diplomacy starting from fixed antipathies and prepossessions, whether those antipathies and prepossessions are in the mind of the Government or in the minds of its agents and informants abroad. Vigilance, alertness, care, will always be needed, with such moderation, good temper, good humour, and cool readiness as will place not the worst but the best construction upon what is said or urged or advanced by the nation with whom you are negotiating.<lb/>
Let us try to look perfectly fairly at German ideals. My noble friend and many of those who sympathise with him overlook the fact&#x2014;the very disagreeable fact for many reasons&#x2014;of the enormous advance of the German Navy during the last ten years. You cannot argue the
<col>384</col>
question that we are discussing here to-day, and which was discussed in the House of Commons last night, if you shut your eyes to a plain and formidable fact of that kind. We cannot really shut our eyes to it because of the tax collector. But in argument I have observed that some political friends of mine do overlook that fact. Friendship for Germany, of course, the whole nation desires immensely. There is no reason why the German naval programme should diminish the desire which I am sure pervades the whole nation. There is nothing in the fact of the gradual extension of their naval power which ought to impair that general feeling of cordial friendship which my noble friend desires. But we must take into consideration all the circumstances. Whether France or Italy or Germany or England has made the greatest contribution in the history of modern civilisation&#x2014;however that speculative controversy may be settled, this at least is certain, that those are not wrong who hold that Germany's high and strict standard of competency, the purity and vigour of her administration of affairs, her splendid efforts and great success in all branches of science, her glories&#x2014;for glories they are&#x2014;in art and literature, and the fixed strength of character and duty in the German people entitle her national ideals to a supreme place among the greatest-ideals that now animate and guide the world. Do not let us forget all that. German ambition is a perfectly intelligible and even lofty ambition. Who can wonder, then, that a community which has made the enormous advances in every field that Germany has made, certainly since 1866, in maritime power and wealth and population should desire to find territories to which her surplus population may emigrate and establish themselves without losing either their nationality or the ideals of the Fatherland? There is the place in the sun. In all these great achievements I have ventured to enumerate the/re is the German place in the sun worth a million times Togoland and even still more Damaraland.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, what would happen supposing the present state of tension were to last? I need not dwell on the serious and constant increase of armament. That is clear to all of us. In one sense the expenditure on armament is one of the least of the evils. This expenditure will impair our means of removing some of the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0197"/>
<col>385</col>
dark and lamentable blots upon our social system, and we must remember that it is not only ourselves who suffer from this, it is the whole of the nations of Europe. The tension between Great Britain and Germany&#x2014;as all those who have seriously considered the bearings of the foreign policy of the day know&#x2014;is one of the main elements in keeping alive that sense of insecurity which is extremely disastrous in many ways. My noble friend used language which I entirely subscribe to about the Concert of Europe. Metternich used it as a phrase of praise of some statesman or another that "he was a good European," and Metternich was the least sentimental of the great foreign statesmen. But there is not a Europe now; there was not, perhaps, at the time at which Metternich spoke. I follow my noble friend step by step in seeing the enormous importance of the restoration of Europe to a continent inhabited by good Europeans, and I believe the first and fundamental and most important step to that desirable end is an understanding between us and Germany.<lb/>
If the House will allow me to do what I ought to have done earlier, I would like, after what has been said about the Foreign Secretary and about his being chilly, and so forth, the House in a sentence or two to see what he did say. After speaking with approval of the speeches of the German Chancellor he said this&#x2014;
<quote>"If that is the spirit of German policy, then I am sure that in two or three years the talk about a great European war will have passed away, and there will have been a growth oil goodwill, not only between Germany and England, but between those two countries and the friends of both. There is a great responsibility upon the British Government and the German Government, and upon other Governments, to make the tone and spirit of these speeches, especially of the second speech of the German Chancellor, prevail in the years which are immediately before us."</quote>
Then he wound up by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"What we want is not to cease to steer a favourable course, and to steer it straight ahead whenever we can. I say that on the assumption that that is the desire of the German Government too. It is certainly the natural inference from the tone and spirit of the speeches of the German Chancellor. If that is his assumption then we shall respond to it, and in some ways, though public opinion may be adverse at the present moment, excited as it recently has been, in some ways one can already see that the horizon is brightening."</quote>
I consider that excellent language, worthy of my right hon. friend and worthy of the occasion.<lb/>
<col>386</col>
My Lords, I am not going to detain you longer. Those complicated proceedings of last summer and to-day, are of course, open to serious criticisms affecting all the three Governments concerned&#x2014;England, France, and Germany&#x2014;criticisms from more sides than one, but they are a million times less open to criticism than they were twenty-four hours ago. That is my own view of the effect of Sir Edward Grey's speech. We and Germany and France have now reached an end of the embarrassments which the three Governments concerned have now every reason to put aside; but that popular discussion in the common controversies of the street and in articles in newspapers should immediately drop is, of course, not to be expected, and it is not to be desired. We must expect public opinion, upon which everything depends, to be active, and in moments, perhaps, adverse. I only make bold to say this, that no Cabinet that ever met in Downing-street was more intent, or could be more intent, than His Majesty's present advisers not to drift into a single unnecessary or impolitic antagonism, and that obligation has been resolutely, persistently, and determinedly adhered to by us, and has been successfully carried through.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01249"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since the noble Lord opposite who introduced this subject to the House put his Motion upon the Paper we have had the long and interesting debate which took place last night in the House of Commons, a debate which included the speech delivered by the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;I venture to think one of the most remarkable speeches ever delivered in the British Parliament by any holder of high office in this country. So much of the ground has been covered by what has been brought to our notice in the course of that debate that I should myself have been well content not to add anything to what has been already said upon the question. But the noble Lord on the Back Bench opposite has treated it from a standpoint of his own&#x2014;a singular standpoint, to my mind, and one which I venture to think will not be found greatly to commend itself to many members of your Lordships' House. The noble Lord traced the origin of all the recent international troubles to the Agreement arrived at between this country and France in the year 1904. He even laid to the charge of that Agreement, unless I am mistaken,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0198"/>
<col>387</col>
the recent occurrences at Tripoli, which I regret as much as he does, and to which I will only refer in order to say that while I deeply regret them I should be very sorry either to pass judgment myself, or to encourage any one else to do so, upon the conduct of the Italian Government.<lb/>
As to the arrangement between this country and France in the year 1904, I do not think I claim too much when I say that the people of this country have already passed judgment upon it, and that that judgment has upon the whole been a favourable one. I believe that that arrangement will influence for a long time to come the external relations of this country and will remain a dominant factor in those relations. I think it will hold that position because the people of this country have recognised what that Agreement was and what it was not. They recognise that it was not a conspiracy on the part of the two Powers against any other Power or Powers in Europe, and not, as the noble Lord opposite seemed to suppose, an attempt to divide Europe into two camps.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01255"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I gladly accept from him the testimonial which he has just given to the harmlessness, at any rate, if not to the merits, of the Agreement itself. The origin of that Agreement&#x2014;and I will not labour the
<col>388</col>
point&#x2014;was in our view entirely legitimate and avowable. An Agreement of the kind had, I believe, been long desired by many people on both sides of the Channel, There had been from time to time recurring conflicts of interests between this country and France at many points. Your Lordships will remember that the Agreement had reference to our relations in Newfoundland, on the Gambia, on the Niger, in Madagascar, and in the New Hebrides. Now the noble Lord, Lord Courtney, referring to Siam, said that the idea of going to war for anything connected with Siam&#x2014;I think I quote him correctly&#x2014;was madness or a crime.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01256"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: Those are the words of the Foreign Secretary, and I adopted them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01257"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: But surely in a case of this kind that is not the real question. The question is whether two great Powers can afford to allow a number of questions of this kind, any one of which at any moment may become acute, to remain without solution. We found that trouble was smouldering at all these points, and in one or two cases, as the noble Lord probably is well aware, that trouble became acute. I can remember not only acute trouble with regard to Siam, but trouble that threatened to become acute with regard to Newfoundland and in one or two other cases. There were some of which it is not too much to say that nothing but the tact and good temper of the representatives of the two Powers upon the spot enabled us to avoid the kind of collision which sometimes involves very serious consequences indeed.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, our opportunity came. It arose, as the House well knows, from the visit and return visit of the late King and the President of the French Republic, and the visit to this country of M. Delcass&#x00E9;, to whom more than to any other one individual is due the credit, if credit is due, for the settlement of these matters. What was the result of the Agreement thus arrived at? It brought about not only a removal of long-standing friction between the two Powers, not only the establishment of a closer friendship between this country and France, but, as the noble Viscount opposite I think suggested, it afforded a very valuable example and precedent for the encouragement of other Powers who might
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0199"/>
<col>389</col>
desire to deal in the same manner with their outstanding difficulties. And let me say that if there was any one aspiration that the Government of that day particularly cherished, it was that this Agreement with France should be the precursor of other Agreements with other Powers.<lb/>
The noble Lord on the Back Bench asked, Why did you not make an Agreement with Germany? Well we did make an Agreement with Germany. We exchanged views with Germany. At that moment there was only one point as to which an opening presented itself, and an Agreement with Germany upon that point did actually follow upon the Agreement between this country and France. It had reference to Egyptian affairs, and other Agreements with other Powers also in regard to Egyptian affairs followed suit. I need not refer to the later Agreement with the United States; or to the Agreement between this country and Russia, an Agreement which some of us are inclined to look upon so far as its details are concerned with a, rather critical eye, but one which has, I hope, rendered it almost inconceivable that we should in future have the kind of anxiety with regard to our relations with Russia which we had immediately before the Treaty of Berlin, or at the time of the Pendjeh incident. I say, therefore, that the whole policy of the late Government was quite inconsistent with the idea of coming to an Agreement with France which should exclude the possibility of Agreements with other Powers, or which should divide the European Powers into two hostile camps.<lb/>
My Lords, may I say that we congratulate ourselves upon the manner in which our policy has been accepted and continued by our successors? They accepted the Agreement deliberately and upon its merits, and have acted upon it loyally ever since. That seems to me a matter for congratulation, not upon personal or Party grounds, but because I conceive that no greater misfortune could befall this country than that there should be a doubt as to the consistency and continuity of its foreign policy or the stability of its international friendships. What has happened with regard to the Agreement of 1904 is, I think a happy illustration of a principle which on both sides of the House we are fond of insisting upon&#x2014;I mean, that the foreign affairs of this country should remain as far as possible outside the vortex of Party
<col>390</col>
politics. The noble Lord on the Back Benches opposite would, I understand, prefer to arrangements of this kind, restricted in their operation to the Powers immediately concerned, an attempt to restore what he calls the Concert of Europe. My Lords, I should be sorry to speak disrespectfully of the Concert of Europe, but it does seem to me that in these days when we find Powers insuring and reinsuring by means of alliance and realliance with other Powers, if we are to await the kind of millennium to which the noble Lord looks forward it is likely to go hard with us in the meanwhile. For this country, with its possessions all over the face of the globe, rubbing shoulders at innumerable points with other and competing Powers, it would to my mind be a fatal mistake if we were to rest content with ploughing a lonely furrow across the affairs of the civilised world.<lb/>
The noble Lord, while he made no complaint of the Agreement of 1904 itself, suggested that this country had gone considerably beyond the legitimate scope of that Agreement. He pointed out that under the ninth Article of the Declaration, all that the contracting Powers are bound to do is to give one another their diplomatic support. That is literally correct. Did we then, in spite of the strict limitation of that engagement, by implication or otherwise, accept a more extended liability? That, I think, is the question which the noble Lord has in his mind. I am glad, may I say in passing, that His Majesty's Government have thought fit to publish the Secret Articles which were attached to the Agreement of 1904. I remain of opinion that we did well at the time to keep those Articles secret, but I fully admit that the time has come when they may well be published. I say so the more because, so long as people knew&#x2014;and many people did know&#x2014;that there were Secret Articles, and did not know what those Articles contained, they were not slow to suggest that we had in effect, while contracting a strictly limited engagement in the published Declaration, surreptitiously added to it obligations of a more extended kind. That bubble has been effectively pricked by the publication of the Secret Articles.<lb/>
But I think it is not unfair to say that, in a case of this kind, an undertaking to give diplomatic support may tend to bring about an obligation to give support of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0200"/>
<col>391</col>
another kind. What happens? Two Powers are drawn together. They enter into closer relations. They accept commercial or political engagements affecting themselves only. Those obligations are honourably fulfilled. There can be no question of receding from them. The relations of the two countries become insensibly closer and more intimate, and in that way, no doubt, a condition of public sentiment does grow up in the face of which it becomes impossible for either Power to be indifferent to the fortunes of the other. Each side, of course, retains its liberty of action. Your friend may become entangled in a foolish or quixotic enterprise; if so he must expect to be left in the lurch. But if he gets into trouble because he loyally observes the terms of his obligation, he will expect that you will not leave him to his fate. But, of course, in every case it is for the contracting Power to judge whether the circumstances and the spirit of the Agreement which has been entered into justify such action and require measures going beyond the strict letter of the recorded obligation.<lb/>
In this case, however, it certainly appears to me that it would be a mistake for us to rest our case solely upon the letter of Article 9 of the Declaration of 1904. Many things happened after the execution of that Article. There was, in the first place, as Lord Courtney truly said, the Act of Algeciras, which to some extent superseded the Declaration of 1904 and rendered the affairs of Morocco a matter of European concern. Then came the expedition to Fez. Then the sending of a German ship of war to Agadir, which remained for some time unexplained. And in this way there is no doubt that a new situation did come to be developed&#x2014;a new situation which, I venture to think, was correctly described by the Prime Minister in the speech which he delivered in the House of Commons on July 27, when he pointed out that it had in his opinion become inevitable that this country should become what he called an "active party" to the discussion of the situation. That, Mr. Asquith said, was our right as a signatory to the Treaty of Algeciras; it might be our obligation under the terms of our Agreement of 1904, and it might be our duty in defence of British interests directly affected by further developments. I think that is, to some extent, an answer to what was said by
<col>392</col>
Lord Courtney as to the Treaty of Algeciras. And I notice particularly that when the diplomatic situation became strained&#x2014;I forget the exact date in the month of July&#x2014;the Foreign Secretary suggested to the German Ambassador that the moment might have come or be approaching when the difficulties which had arisen could be dealt with by means of a conference. I take it that that was in fact an admission, a recognition by our Foreign Office that the case was one where such action might be taken under the Act of Algeciras. Of course we know that the proposal did not commend itself to the German Government, and that it was not further pressed.<lb/>
With regard to the course of the negotiations I will only say this. It seems to me that the Foreign Secretary's statement last night let in a great flood of new light upon what took place during the course of those "conversations." There were obscurities which have been removed. There were gaps, serious gaps, which have been filled up, and I think His Majesty's Government have a right to say that it has now been established that, if there was reticence, it was the German Government who kept us waiting for a fuller indication of their policy, and not we who kept the German Government waiting for an indication of ours. When the indication came I am bound to say that I think it was a satisfactory indication, and my only regret is that it was not vouchsafed and was not made public at a somewhat earlier date.<lb/>
Lord Courtney referred to the memorable speech delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on July 21 at the Mansion House. As to that, I will only suggest that as a general rule it would be more convenient that an important pronouncement of that kind, governing the foreign policy of this country, should be made by the Secretary of State in his place in Parliament. I say that without suggesting that in Mr. Lloyd George's observations there was anything to which any one could reasonably take exception. A part of what he said has been quoted by the noble Viscount, and, in a sense, may be said to be a little more than a common-place. But common-places, if they are uttered by particular people in particular circumstances, may be charged with a good deal of political electricity, and I for one
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0201"/>
<col>393</col>
prefer to see so important an intimation of our foreign policy coming from the. Secretary of State with that admirable coolness and lucidity which invariably characterise his speeches.<lb/>
My Lords, the crisis which has exercised our minds so much is now, happily, over, and I have no doubt that all concerned, to whatever political camp they belong, will use every effort to render the recurrence of such a period of tension impossible. There seems to be no doubt with regard to the attitude of His Majesty's Government. I do not think there is any doubt with regard to the attitude of what I may term the official Opposition, and I cannot help hoping, judging from the speeches lately delivered by the German Chancellor, of which copies are on your Lordships' Table, that a similar spirit may be exhibited in Germany. But these official efforts will. I am afraid, be of no avail unless they are seconded by public opinion and public language in both countries. There are, I am afraid, fire-eaters on both sides, and there are too many people who are guilty of the offence, which the noble Viscount referred to just now, of placing the worst instead of the best construction upon everything that happens and upon everything that is said. But I do believe that the main current of public opinion amongst reasonable people in both countries is strongly in favour of the kind of friendship between Great Britain and Germany which Lord Courtney so earnestly desires. Feelings on both sides have no doubt been somewhat highly strung of late, and they may take some time to subside. But the two countries are, after all, bound by many ties, and I believe there is a general desire on our side at all events that those ties should be strengthened, a general belief that there is abundant room for both countries in the world, a general readiness to come to an understanding with regard to any difficulties which still remain unsolved, and a conviction that the greatest interest of both Powers is the preservation of international peace.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01258"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WEARDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I waited for a few moments before rising to see whether an unofficial member of the Opposition would have some observations to make upon the course of this debate. But it appears to me extremely desirable that some voice, at all events,
<col>394</col>
should be raised in support of the general contentions that have been advanced by my noble friend Lord Courtney; and on this ground. It has been too much assumed in the course of this debate, particularly by my noble friend the noble Viscount, that the course of the negotiations in the matter of Morocco has received universal assent and been objected to by hardly any class of public: opinion. I would point to the Liberal Press of this morning, uninspired and generally most loyally disposed to His Majesty's Government. I can find in no one of those newspapers a sincere appreciation or congratulation of the Government upon the course taken. That hardly looks as if public opinion took the view which my noble friend the noble Viscount below me supposes is the general view, at any rate, of Liberal opinion in the matter of the Morocco negotiations.<lb/>
The noble Marquess opposite began his speech by a somewhat elaborate defence of the Agreement of 1904. I am not conscious that anybody in this House or anywhere else has ever at any time condemned or even criticised that great act of friendship between France and ourselves. No one with common sense can deny that enormous benefits have accrued to the world by the increasing friendship between France and Great Britain, and nothing that my noble friend or anybody else here or elsewhere has said is in any way derogatory of the great principle that friendship between France and Great Britain makes for the prosperity and peace of the world. But is that inconsistent with a policy of friendship with Germany? That is the question which has been raised by the Motion of my noble friend, and it is the sole question which we are now called upon to consider; because, happily for ourselves, as has been admitted by all speakers to-night, the actual crisis is now over, and we have to consider not the immediate circumstances of the hour but the possibilities of the future and whether or not we can arrive at a more satisfactory understanding between Great Britain and Germany.<lb/>
On that subject I can only say that I am afraid that, not altogether but in some degree, I share the view of my noble friend as to the course of the Morocco negotiations. We do not seem to have been inspired by what may be called an impartial view of the situation. We appear to have taken rather
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0202"/>
<col>395</col>
a one-sided&#x2014;I say that not at all to the detriment of the Anglo-French Agreement&#x2014;instead of a larger view of the whole considerations involved in that, after all, matter of European concern. And it is for that reason I deplore, extremely the action of my right hon. friend Mr. Lloyd George when he made his celebrated speech at the Mansion House. I think that speech was a profound mistake. What he said might have been communicated in the ordinary way through official channels, and have been conveyed to those whom it was intended to influence. Remember the circumstances under which that speech was made. It was made at a time of great tension, when public opinion was extremely ill-informed or not informed at all upon the course of the negotiations, and when, in short, it needed but a spark, unfortunately, to inflame it. Consequently a speech of that sort at that time was about the most dangerous thing possible. I hope that in future the Government, when they have such serious pronouncements or communications to make, will use the ordinary methods of diplomacy for the purpose of making them.<lb/>
I only rose, as I said, to make those few observations in a liberal spirit. I believe, with my noble friend, that the words used by my right hon. friend Sir John Simon the other day at Bath really and effectively gave expression to the general sentiments of all thinking men in this country with regard to Germany. We are anxious to arrive to-day at a direct understanding with Germany, as we did in 1904 with France. What is the difficulty in so doing? There are not very many questions of practical disagreement with Germany. Is it impossible to approach Germany in the same spirit as we approached France and endeavour to bring about an understanding on the same lines? I believe that such an agreement would be in the best interests of France. What greater service could we render to the French people than being a friend who, in cases of difference between France and Germany, could step in to compose them, to attempt to allay their irritation and bring them to a happy understanding? I do not regret that this question has been raised by my noble friend this evening, because I believe it will focus public attention on what is now of supreme importance to this country&#x2014;namely, to arrive at a complete understanding with Germany. Tranquillity will
<col>396</col>
never be restored to the public mind, our relations abroad will continue to be troublesome, until that standing discontent between two great peoples has been successfully removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01259"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not surprised at the disappointment which has been expressed by my noble friend opposite, being well acquainted with his political views; but I confess that if anybody has drawn any hopeful conclusions either from the debate in the other House or from that which has taken place here this evening, he is of an infinitely more sanguine disposition than I am. What is the outstanding fact with regard to all that has recently occurred? It is that in a dispute between France and Germany we have, whether we wished it or not, been compelled to intervene on the part of France, and we have therefore been instrumental in preventing the Germans from obtaining what they desired to obtain. That being so, human nature being what it is and Governments presumably entertaining more or less the same feelings as ordinary human beings, there does not seem to be much hope for the belief that the result of these events will cause a better state of feeling between this country and Germany than has hitherto existed. If there is anybody who does build hopes upon this supposition, I am afraid he will be woefully disappointed.<lb/>
And I confess that for my part I am unable to obtain much satisfaction from that formula which is so much in fashion at the present moment&#x2014;namely, that because this country is friends with A, therefore we are friends also with B and C. A view of that kind, although it is uttered frequently by eminent personages, seems to me to be perilously akin to pure nonsense. We are all of us acquainted with persons who are under the delusion that the rest of the world is, so to speak, in love with them. It appears to be the impression of a certain number of distinguished people in this country that if we only say that we like everybody equally everybody ought to be perfectly satisfied, and therefore that if A and B fall out and we are obliged to take the side of A, B has no cause to be dissatisfied with us. It seems to me that the position that you ought to be friends with everybody is an impossible one, and one that will not hold water for a single moment.<lb/>
With regard to the events which have recently taken place, it is easy for a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0203"/>
<col>397</col>
censorious critic to point out that no party has been entirely free from blame. Everybody must admit that the initial fault, if we are to be fair in this matter, rested with the French Government. As has been pointed out in the course of this debate, the limits imposed by the Algeciras Act were exceeded on several occasions by the French Government. There appears to be a vague delusion in this country that under that Act the French Government was authorised to establish something like a protectorate over Morocco, whereas we know perfectly well that such was not the case at all. These infractions of the limits imposed on the French Government culminated in the expedition to Fez, and it became inevitable, after that expedition had taken place, that German intervention of some kind or another had become a certainty, and German intervention took the form, as we all know, of sending a warship to Agadir. It was an instance of what the Germans in their own language call sabre rattling, and apparently after a, certain interval had elapsed His Majesty's Government thought that it was time they ought to do some sabre rattling on their own account, and they put up Mr. Lloyd George&#x2014;or I should rather be disposed to think he put himself up&#x2014;in order to deliver a speech addressed to the German nation; and it is a somewhat singular fact that this emotional politician, whom so many people will persist in considering a statesman, the greater part of whose political career has been passed in denouncing military and naval expenditure, should be the person selected to make a speech which conveyed the impression to the bulk of his fellow-countrymen that we were on the brink of war.<lb/>
I can quite understand that the German Government&#x2014;or, in fact, any Government&#x2014;should resent being lectured by Mr. Lloyd George. It is one thing receiving an intimation from the Foreign Secretary, but it is quite another matter to, as I say, be lectured by a third person. Surely the natural and obvious course would have been, if a warning were really necessary, that that warning should have been addressed either by the Foreign Secretary or by the Prime Minister of this country. It could have been done by means of a Despatch, it could have been done by means of a speech in the House of Commons, or it might even have been done, in default of anything else, by a speech in
<col>398</col>
this House. What I maintain is that an action of this kind, a speech made by a politician of the aggressive type of Mr. Lloyd George, was bound to produce a disastrous effect so far as the relations of the two countries were concerned, and if His Majesty's Government regret that ill-feeling has been aroused between this country and Germany in an unnecessary way, they have only themselves to thank in selecting an inflammatory orator of this description to enunciate their policy.<lb/>
The noble Lord who initiated this debate announced that something was to be said with regard to what he called consequential questions. There is an obviously consequential question&#x2014;namely, the question of Tripoli; but I do not intend, in view of the warning conveyed by the noble Marquess, to say anything with regard to the rights and wrongs of that question at the present moment. I merely desire to put a couple of questions to the noble Viscount opposite which I hope he may be able to answer without impropriety. All that I desire to ask him is (1) whether His Majesty's Government received any warning beforehand of a contemplated expedition to Tripoli on the part of Italy; (2) whether His Majesty's Government have received any information as to a proposed blockade of the Dardanelles, and whether there is any foundation for the statement that the Russian and the Austrian Governments have protested in advance against such action. In asking these questions I hope I am not committing an indiscretion, and that the noble Viscount will be able to give me a reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01260"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Lord has committed any indiscretion. The reply to both questions is in the negative. The Italian Ultimatum only gave us twenty-four hours' notice, and we were not informed of it beforehand. With regard to the Dardanelles, we have no information, nor do we understand that Austria or Russia has protested against any proposal about the Dardanelles.</membercontribution></p>

otherwise I will withdraw it. I desire to take this opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to my noble friend near me (Lord Weardale) for clearing up the singular misapprehension of my position into which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has fallen. I entirely approved of the Treaty of 1904 and of the Act of Algeciras. I only protested against the abuse which had been made, as I thought, of that Act, and against the fact that what was not an exclusive act of friendship had been most unfortunately perverted into an exclusive act of friendship, and I submitted that that was the origin of the difficult position in which we were placed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>RAG FLOCK BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01269" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01270">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01271"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to-day is really a very simple one. There is a substance, as your Lordships may be aware, called rag flock, a material which is most commonly used for filling mattresses and stuffing upholstery, and so forth. It consists of rags, mainly woollen and other mixed rags, which are torn into pieces by a machine called a laniating machine. The machine tears up all kinds of rags, pieces of carpet, old clothes, and such things, as too often unfortunately get mixed up with the soft material which is utilised for stuffing beds and so on. From inquiries made by the Local Government Board Inspectors it has been ascertained that a large proportion of the rags used in this process are very filthy and dirty, picked up very often from road and other refuse heaps, and they are frequently in a very verminous condition.
<col>402</col>
An Inspector of the Local Government Board, in his report, says that it would be difficult to exaggerate in describing the filthy nature of much of the material employed. Although I have no reason to suppose that, for instance, any of the red benches on which your Lordships are sitting, or the Woolsack on which the learned Earl the Lord Chancellor is sitting, are stuffed with such material as I have described, I am quite sure you will agree with me that to use such material for the purposes named is repugnant to our ideas of decency and cleanliness, even where it is difficult&#x2014;as of course it is to a large extent&#x2014;to connect disease with rag flock.<lb/>
The Bill, as the House will have observed, is practically a one clause Bill, but with its many subsections it looks an alarmingly long clause. The object of the Bill, shortly, is to control the manufacture and use of rag flock in the matter of cleanliness. The Bill provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"It shall not be lawful for any person to sell or have in his possession for sale flock manufactured from rags or to use for the purpose of making any article of upholstery, cushions, or bedding flock manufactured from rags or to have in his possession flock manufactured from rags intended to be used fur any such purpose, unless the flock conforms to such standard of cleanliness as may be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Local Government Board" and so on.</quote>
The Board proposes at present to prescribe what is known as a chlorine test, a chemical test which I believe very easily indicates the presence of dirt. As your Lordships will see, the powers that the Bill gives may seem to be somewhat wide. It may be that a little later it may perhaps be found desirable to prescribe a rather more severe test, and the Local Government Board will prescribe whatever test they may be advised by their medical officer is necessary.<lb/>
The regulations which the Board make are to be laid before Parliament in the usual manner, and to be subject to the Rules Publication Act, 1893, Section 1 of which provides that the regulations must be laid on the Table of both Houses for a certain number of days, and must also be published in the <i>Gazette</i> so as to give notice to the trades affected. The respectable manufacturers, I believe, recognise the unsatisfactory condition of this trade, and are in favour of legislation to control it. As your Lordships will see, certain fines for selling this unclean
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0206"/>
<col>403</col>
flock are proposed&#x2014;&#x00A3;10 for the first offence and &#x00A3;50 for subsequent offences. The greater part of the Bill deals with machinery for making the Bill operative, and defines the persons and local authorities who are to assist in carrying out the provisions. The Bill applies to Scotland and Ireland, and although as at present drafted you will see it is proposed that the Bill shall come into operation on the 1st of January, 1912, it is felt that further time must be given after the Bill is passed to enable manufacturers to instal proper washing plant. If your Lordships agree to give this Bill a Second Reading, as I hope you will, when it reaches Committee an Amendment will be moved to alter the date to the 1st of October, 1912. I may say that the Bill passed through all its stages in the House of Commons without any discussion or any question being raised.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01273"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not a word to say against the Bill, the Second Reading of which the noble Viscount has just moved, and the one observation which I had to make upon it has been discounted by his concluding remarks. I am very glad to hear from him that in Committee he will propose an alteration of the date on which the Bill will come into operation. It is a drastic Bill. I do not find fault with it on that account, because it certainly seems to me that this is a case where drastic action is called for. But I think it would have been a real hardship to have compelled persons engaged in this industry to conform to the provisions of the Bill from January 1 next. The Bill can only become law in the month of December, and it will obviously be necessary for manufacturers and others to set up new washing plant, new drying stores, and so on, for the completion of the processes required by this Bill. It would therefore have been a great hardship to submit to pains and penalties as from January 1 next any persons who failed to comply with the standard of requirements set up by the Bill, and I am very glad to hear from the noble Viscount that he is ready to postpone the date upon which the Bill will come into operation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01277"><member>LORD KILLANIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the House goes into Committee on this Bill I should like to ask the noble Lord who represents Irish interests in this House (Lord Ashby St. Ledgers) one question. I observe he has put down some Amendments to the Bill, and I presume that means that the Irish Office approves of the Bill. But I would like to ask whether this Bill has been submitted to and approved by the Irish Local Government Board and the Irish County Councils' organisation, and whether it has been brought under the notice of the Road Board and the Development Commissioners. I would invite the noble Lord to exercise circumspection in this matter, because it so very often turns out, as noble Lords must know, that when in the future we want to carry out some improvement in reference to transit facilities and such like work, some regulation in some Bill like this blocks all progress, and we are told that we cannot carry out the improvement unless we get a certain Act repealed. It therefore becomes impossible to carry out what may be a very desirable improvement. There are considerable portions of Ireland in which transit facilities are very badly required, and only quite recently Lord Iveagh and Lord Pirrie experienced the difficulty I have referred to when proposing to carry out transit services in certain parts of Ireland, not merely a motor passenger service, but a service of wagons carrying goods, and the scheme came to an end. Under the operations of the Development Commissioners it is very likely that there may be a desire to start similar motor transit facilities in Ireland, involving heavy wagons for carrying goods, in districts which have no train service and no other mode of carrying either passengers or goods; and it would be lamentable if in the future it should turn out that any regulation in this Bill impeded the carrying out of such improvements. I would therefore ask the noble Lord, if the Irish Office is going to adopt this measure, whether it has been thoroughly considered by the Local Government Board, by the Irish County Councils' organisation, and by the Development Commissioners, not only from the aspect of the present position but from the possible and likely aspect of the future when new transit facilities are desired.</membercontribution></p>

All I can say is that the Irish Office approve of the Bill, and I presume it has not aroused any hostility on the part of the bodies to whom the noble Lord referred, otherwise naturally they would have communicated with the Irish Office about it. I do not myself think that the restrictions which he anticipates upon motor traffic come under the terms of this Bill. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, when he spoke on this subject on the Second Reading on August 31, was, I think, under the impression that this Bill was intended to cover the case of motor traffic. I do not think it does; but perhaps we shall get to closer quarters when I move the Amendments which I propose to move on the subject.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0010P0I0208"/>
<col>407</col>
of Commons, were really the result of misapprehension. It seems to have been thought that when legislating for the weights of locomotives some provision ought to be made for the weight of locomotive wagons, and in consequence of that these words were inserted. But, as a matter of fact, there is a sufficient reason for not alluding to the wagons in dealing with this question. That matter is already regulated by the Locomotives Act of 1861, which applies to the United Kingdom as a whole. In that Act it is laid down that wagons of 1&#x00BD; tons for each pair of wheels are to have tyres of not less than 3 inches in width, and so forth, and therefore it does not seem desirable to retain these words when the ground is already covered by a previous Act. I may say also that the drafting as it stands is not satisfactory. For instance, it is difficult to discover the difference between a locomotive wagon and a wagon hauled by a locomotive; and, moreover, I understand there is no penalty imposed for an infringement of the clause. I therefore hope your Lordships will agree to omit these words on the ground that they are unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>

It is not very certain what the intention of this subsection is, and perhaps it was this subsection which led the noble Marquess to believe that this Bill was intended to apply to motor traffic. But if it were so it is perfectly obvious that it would be very undesirable in the shape in which it at present stands, even if it were desirable at all to introduce legislation dealing with the subject. It has nothing to do with the weight carried by the wagon or the locomotive wagon; it merely refers to the unloaded weight of the vehicle. A large wagon just under 3 tons capable of carrying a very great weight would come under the same conditions as a trailer drawn by a motor cycle, and the subsection would impose on the trailer the necessity of having tyres 3 inches in width. As far as one can understand what is contemplated here, such provisions do not apply to any other part of the United Kingdom, and it is thought

desirable, therefore, that this subsection should be omitted.</membercontribution></p>

I am sure the noble Lord would not wish to put any difficulty in the way of passenger-carrying vehicles which might weigh 3 tons and therefore be called locomotive wagons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01297"><member>LORD CHARNWOOD</member><membercontribution>: I do not agree that there is nothing touching motors in this Bill. The first clause covers motors, and is particularly aimed at enabling road authorities to recover damages inflicted upon the roads by any kind of extraordinary traffic of excessive weight. That clause, therefore, would apply particularly to motor chars-a-banes, as I believe they are called. The whole of the other provisions in the Bill, the provisions as to weight, breadth of wheels, and so forth, are so framed that they would not apply to any kind of motor whatsoever. It is solely Clause 1 which applies to motors of this description.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01298"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: I presume I am not in order in referring to Clause 1, which has already been passed. But arising out of what the noble Lord has just said, if it is really intended that difficulties should be put in the way of the excellent service of motor cars which has been established by various Irish railways, for instance, for the purpose of carrying people to the different picturesque resorts in Ireland, it would be a very serious thing. I do not think that the House understood that that was within the power of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01299"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST.

What some of us want to know is whether beyond all doubt this Bill does provide for a case which has notoriously arisen, particularly in certain parts of Ireland with which I am familiar. That case is this. Large motor cars of great weight, capable of carrying, I should think from twenty to thirty people, are being used upon roads constructed for light traffic only. The result is that the surface of the road is entirely destroyed, and the ratepayers are involved in very great expense in making good the damage. I take it the noble Lord is under the impression that that case is provided for by the clause which has already been passed.</membercontribution></p>

I know I am out of order in referring to it now, but I am under the impression that that clause is so drawn that any motor ear weighing more than three tons&#x2014;I think that is the weight&#x2014;would be beyond the reach of the Bill. My point is that the owners of a car of that description, if it is constructed to carry a great number of people and is of such a weight as to occasion serious damage to the surface of the roads, should be made liable for the exceptional mischief which they do to the roads by the use of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01303"><member>LORD CHARNWOOD</member><membercontribution>: I went into this point carefully with the draftsman, and I conceive there is no doubt at all that the definition clause to which the noble Marquess refers does not apply at all to Clause 1, and that consequently Clause I, which provides a remedy to road authorities where their roads are damaged by extraordinary traffic or by the excessive weight of traffic, would apply to any kind of vehicle of an excessive weight or of an extraordinary kind.

<title>FISHERY RIGHTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01346"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> rose to call the attention of the House to the two recent cases decided by the House of Lords, in its appellate jurisdiction, in respect of fisheries in the River Wye and Lough Neagh (Ireland); and to ask His Majesty's Government whether, in view of these decisions, they will consider the expediency of legislation for the purpose of giving greater legal sanction to immemorial and unquestioned user by the public or by classes of persons of fishing in parts of the lakes and rivers of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01347">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in calling the attention of the House to two very remarkable and interesting fishery cases decided a few weeks ago, by a curious coincidence on the same day, and decided in both cases by a majority of four to three against the fishermen whose interests are concerned, I do not propose to criticise the judgments of the Judges in the two cases. I think it would be a very bad precedent if I were to call in question the judgments of the Supreme Court in this House and provoke a discussion between the Judges who might be present in this House. For the purposes of what I shall say to-night I shall take the judgment of the majority as the law of the land as declared by the Supreme Court, and I shall endeavour to show, that being the case, that it will work harshly on the fishermen concerned in the particular cases, and will prove equally harsh in many other cases in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01348">In the first of these cases, that of the River Wye, the freeholders of five parishes adjoining the river have for many past centuries, possibly since Doomsday, enjoyed by custom the right of fishing in a reach of the river seven miles in length, and they have enjoyed this custom or right without any question by anybody or any attempt on the part of the riparian owners during the whole of those centuries to interfere with them or in any way object to the exercise of it. The right of netting in this reach of the river was in former days exercised by a small community of fishermen living in the immediate neighbourhood adjoining the river, but of late years, in consequence of the very high fees which have been charged by the Conservancy of the river, the number of these fishermen has been considerably reduced, and practically the right has only been enjoyed by a very few. But the freeholders of the five parishes also enjoyed the rod fishing in the river.
<col>414</col>
For the first time for centuries this custom or right has been called in question by the riparian owners. The case came up by way of appeal from the Court below, and the Muse of Lords, by a majority of four to three, decided against this custom, and declared that it was invalid, and that there cannot be a custom alleged on the part of the freeholders of a district in the nature of a <i>profit-&#x00E1;-prendre,</i> and also that a custom to take fish without stint in a river is unknown to the law of England. They have consequently declared the custom to be invalid; they have deprived the fishermen of their means of living; they have deprived the freeholders of the five parishes of which I spoke of their rod-fishing; and they have vested these rights in the riparian owners, who, as I said, have never from time immemorial claimed it before. I think, therefore, that anybody looking at this case will feel that the law as declared by the Judges, although no doubt good law&#x2014;that is to say, a declaration of the law as it now stands&#x2014;is open to very great question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01349">The other case, that of Lough Neagh, is a still more remarkable one. Lough Neagh is the largest lake in the United Kingdom; it is 24 miles in length by 16 miles in breadth, and is, in fact, an inland sea. It communicates with the sea by the River Bann. For several hundred years the fishermen in the neighbourhood have fished in tough Neagh without any question being raised of right. Nobody has ever for a moment questioned their right to do so. The fishermen at the present day are some 800 in number, and although many of them are not wholly dependent upon the fishing they owe their living in great part to the fishing, and with their families they constitute a community of something like 2,000 or 3,000 people. It appears that in the time of Charles II the Crown gave a grant of all the fisheries in the River Bann to the Lord Donegall of that day, and included in the grant were also the fisheries of Lough Neagh. It seems exceedingly doubtful whether the Crown had any right to make a grant of the fishing of the lough. I believe it is now settled law that the Crown is not the owner of the fisheries in inland lakes. Of course, it is just possible that there might have been a forfeiture to the Crown of all the land adjoining the lake and adjoining the River Bann, but that seems to be exceedingly unlikely. But, at all events, whatever the inception of this right may be, the fisheries in the River
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0212"/>
<col>415</col>
Bann have always been exercised by the Lords of Donegall and their successors, and are now by the present representative&#x2014;or rather by the lessees of the present representative&#x2014;Lord Shaftesbury.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01350">I may mention, in passing, that I believe the present Lord Shaftesbury has practically no interest in the matter, because the fisheries&#x2014;both the eel fisheries and the salmon fisheries of the River Bann and Lough Neagh&#x2014;have been leased for very long periods of years. The eel fisheries have been granted under a lease for 5,000 years, and, of course, the reversion to that can be of no value whatever. But the lessees of the present representatives of the Donegall family, having this lease of the eel fisheries of the River Bann, brought a suit against the fishermen of Lough Neagh and asked for an injunction against them to forbid them fishing for eels in Lough Neagh. I may mention that the value of the eel fisheries is very great both in the River Bann and in Lough Neagh. When I state the fact that the rental paid by the lessees to the Donegall estate is something like &#x00A3;880 a year, it will be seen that the value is very considerable; and the eel fisheries in Lough Neagh are also of great value. It has been held by the Supreme Court that. this grant by the Crown in respect of the River Bann is undoubtedly a good foundation for the title of the lessees of the Donegall estate, and they have also held that, although the user of the fisheries in Lough Neagh by lessees of the River Bann fisheries has been very small, yet the user is enough to substantiate that right also. They have, therefore, granted an injunction against the Lough Neagh fishermen to restrain them from fishing for eels in Lough Neagh. It is clear, further, that this judgment will have the same effect in challenging the rights as regards the other fisheries of Lough Neagh. The judgment only deals with the eel fisheries, but it was admitted in the argument before the Court that the principles involved would also determine the whole of the interest in all the fisheries in Lough Neagh. Therefore practically it has been held that the fishermen who have been in the habit for many centuries of fishing in Lough Neagh have got no legal right to do so, that they are there merely by leave and licence of the person interested under this right from the Crown, and that they may be dispossessed at any moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01351">Although I do not wish to say anything which impugns the judgment of the Court
<col>416</col>
in this matter, I must take notice of one very extraordinary fact. The Judges were evenly divided in the case&#x2014;that is to say, of the seven Judges six were evenly divided&#x2014;three in favour of the fishermen and three against them. But Lord Ashbourne, whom I see on the other side of the House, apparently went neither with one set nor the other. So far as I read his judgment he gave it as his opinion that the plaintiffs, the lessees of the Donegall estate, had proved their case only in respect of one-third of the Lough and not as regards the other two-thirds.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01352"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: But that the injunction given by the Judge was quite right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01353"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: That may be; but I think I am right with regard to the two-thirds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01354"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01355"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord seems to have given the most extraordinary care to this case and also to the other one. He decided in favour of the fishermen in the Wye case, and he decided in the manner I have just told your Lordships in the Lough Neagh case. He gave it as his opinion that as regards one-third of the lough the lessees of the Donegall estate had proved their title, but not as regards the other two-thirds; and therefore, if his judgment were to hold, the fishermen would still remain in possession of whatever rights they had as regards two-thirds of the lough. The noble and learned Lord apparently wished that the judgment of the Court might be amended in that sense, but it seems that that change could not be made at that stage of the proceedings, and the judgment of the Court is to the effect that the plaintiffs have established their right to the eel fisheries over the whole of the lough. There is this extraordinary result, therefore, that although three of the Judges held that the fishermen are entitled to the whole of the fisheries over the whole of the lough and one Judge held that they are entitled to fish over two-thirds of it, yet the judgment of the Court is that the fishermen are deprived of the right of fishing for eels over the whole of the lough. That seems to me to be a somewhat strange proceeding. The actual decision of the Court, if I am right in what I say, is that the plaintiffs are
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0213"/>
<col>417</col>
entitled to the fishing over the whole of the lough. Of course, the judgment cannot, now be impugned, but, as I say, it does seem to be a somewhat strange result.<lb/>
My Lords, taking the two cases together, they seem to me to bang the door altogether against any possibility of the public or any classes of persons at any time hereafter proving a right of fishing by custom in any lake in the United Kingdom or in any part of any river. As regards lakes, the question has not previously been absolutely decided; and in a case which came up to the House of Lords affecting this very Lough Neagh it seems that Lord Cairns, who was undoubtedly one of the greatest Judges who ever sat on the English Bench, said it was an open question whether the public had any right over the lough or not, and the same opinion was expressed in the Court below by three other Judges of very great repute&#x2014;namely, Chief Baron Palles, Lord Fitzgerald and Baron Dowse. They all said it was an open question whether the public had a right to fish in the lakes of England and Ireland&#x2014;I will not say Scotland. But the judgment which has now been given seems to me to make it absolutely clear, as far as it can be made clear, that the public have no right whatever to fish by custom in any lake or river. That has been distinctly laid down by Lord Halsbury, Lord Macnaghten, and Lord Dunedin.<lb/>
Is it a right state of law which declares that the public under no circumstances whatever can acquire a right by custom to fish in the lakes and rivers of this country? What the effect of such a decision will be is very difficult to say. I believe in the case of the very large majority of the lakes in England and Ireland the public in fact have enjoyed from time immemorial the custom of fishing in them, and I think I am right in saying that in a large number of rivers the public have exercised the right of fishing over parts of them. Let me take the case of the River Thames. In the case of the Thames below Staines the public have had a right of fishing because the fishing in that part has fortunately been vested in the Corporation of London; but above Staines, though there are very large parts of the river where the public have in point of fact exercised the right of fishing by custom, there are other parts where the riparian owners have maintained and exercised their exclusive right. But in the parts of the Thames which
<col>418</col>
are still open I am told that something like 7,000 disciples of Izaak Walton habitually fish.<lb/>
As far as I understand the two cases to which I have referred, neither the public nor any classes of persons can in future ever claim by way of custom a right of fishing in any part of any river or of any lake, and I must say that for my part I think the law which lays that down is open to grave question. I can conceive no better foundation for a right of any kind than long established user. The law, I believe, gives a right in the case of land to possession after twelve years' usage; and yet apparently a custom may be exercised for hundreds of years by fishermen in the lakes and rivers of this country without giving any right whatever. I believe I am correct in saying that no such law exists in any other part of Europe. In the greater part of Europe the fishing in navigable rivers belongs to the Government in trust for the inhabitants generally of the country, and that is also the case with the larger lakes. In the case of the smaller lakes, and in the case of the rivers which are not navigable, the right of fishing as a rule belongs to the community of the district, and is for the benefit of the people forming that community. Riparian owners generally on the Continent have no exclusive right. Nobody wishes to interfere with the exclusive right of riparian owners where it has been actually exercised in this country; but it does seem to me that where that exclusive right has not been maintained, and where the public have for generations exercised the custom or right of fishing in the lakes and the rivers, the law of this country ought to be amended so as to recognise and maintain that right. At all events, I venture to think that the question is one which deserves the most serious consideration of the Government with a view to revising and amending the law. I venture, therefore, to put to the Government the Question of which I have given notice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01356"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not in the least degree complain of the noble Lord in having brought forward this subject, because, although it involves the consideration of two very important cases that have been decided in this House, it also shows a condition of the law which it is quite right should be presented to the consideration of Parliament. Let me say, in the first place, that for the legal decisions
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0214"/>
<col>419</col>
of this House the House itself at large is, of course, in no way responsible. These decisions are given by those of us who sit judicially, and we have nothing whatever to do with public or private convenience. All we have to do is to ascertain the truth of the facts presented to us, and to apply the law of the country, as we believe it to be, to those facts. The ulterior consequences are not for us; they are for the Legislature. All we have to do is to try and apply the law to ascertained facts. I do not think that the noble Lord would have been successful, even if he had attacked any of the Judges, which he has not done, in inducing one or other of them to rise either to defend themselves or to inveigh one against the other.<lb/>
Although both these decisions were, as a matter of fact, arrived at contrary to my expressed opinion, I have no doubt whatever that the noble Lords who came to these conclusions did so after the greatest care and pains&#x2014;I know they did&#x2014;and with a single desire to administer justice according to their view of the law of the land. That being so, let me state in a few words the purport of both of these cases, which as presented by the noble. Lord were a little disfigured, I think, in his statement, although in substance I do not complain of his description. The first of them was this. In the River Wye, for a distance of something like seven miles, there has been, certainly since a long time previous to the year 1637, and, as I believe, as far back as Doomsday and probably before the Conquest, but certainly for three or four hundred years, a claim of right acted upon and recorded in the rolls of the manor for all the freeholders in five parishes adjoining the river to fish in that river. There was no question that this supposed right was recorded for centuries and acted upon, until a year or two ago. A question arose as to whether or not there could be in law such a right not vested in any corporation. There were two opinions, and in substance the one which prevailed was that there could be no such right. The other, in which I shared, was that the great Judges who sat here before&#x2014;Lord Cairns, Lord Selborne, Lord Watson, and others&#x2014;had established a precedent for presuming some antecedent creation of a corporation so as to be the possessors of a right which must have had some legal existence if it had been constantly used for centuries. That was the difference between us.<lb/>
<col>420</col>
The other case was the case of Lough Neagh. That was a different kind of question; it was whether there could be a public right for anybody who pleased to fish in waters which were not tidal waters but fresh water. There is no question that from time immemorial the inhabitants of the district of Lough Neagh had, in fact, fished without question, and we were told that hundreds of families subsisted and had subsisted for many years upon the produce of that fishing. Whether that is really accurate I cannot say, but that is what was stated. A question arose in that case whether a title created as long ago as the time of James I and confirmed by Charles II was a sufficient title. The deeds of the Donegall family went back to the year 1605, and the question arose whether it was only a paper title or whether it was a real title. On the one side it was maintained that it was a title supported by sufficient proof of user and enjoyment. I will not say a word about the complicated story which had to be unravelled in regard to that. That was the contention on one side. On the other hand, there were some Judges who, like myself, considered that it was merely a title on paper, and had never been accompanied by any enjoyment for all these centuries, and that whether the public were entitled to claim the right or not, the fact that they had used the fishing showed that there was no private right in those proprietors who claimed the fishery. I accept, of course, the decision of the noble Lords who came to the conclusion referred to. I am only wishing to explain to the House the nature of the strange conflict which arose, dating from very long ago, as to the right of fishing in Lough Neagh. Those are the facts. The noble Lord is quite mistaken as regards the part taken by Lord Ashbourne. Lord Ashbourne is here, and if it is necessary he is perfectly well able to protect himself. I will not, therefore, trouble any further on that subject.<lb/>
The result was that in both cases the claims of the fishermen were negatived. I cannot help feeling that the result of these decisions does make it impracticable for any one to maintain hereafter that the public can have, in law, any right to fish in fresh water. I have never myself expressed assent to the doctrine that the public cannot in law have a right to fish in fresh water. It is quite true that Lord Cairns, in a great case, some thirty years ago, did not commit himself on that subject.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0215"/>
<col>421</col>
But what had certainly been generally considered to be the law has now been established in this House that the public can have no such right. Of course, that is a question quite apart from these particular decisions, which we are bound to take as correct, and which I am quite certain were arrived at after the most anxious consideration. It is true, I think, that the law now, at all events, is certainly established that the public can have no right of fishing at all in any fresh waters in this country.<lb/>
I am now asked what view the Government propose to take with regard to it. I think that it is a thing well worth consideration. I do not wish to be understood as in the least committing the Government, but, speaking for myself and only for myself, I do feel that in this matter the course of laws and decisions, which have always been scrupulously careful to protect private property, have not always been so careful to protect public rights. Probably it was because in the case of the public it is everybody's business and therefore nobody's business. But for my part, if it can be done without interfering with fair and just vested interest belonging to individuals and which have been enjoyed by them, I would be very glad if something could be done in order to prevent what I think is an anomaly and unwise from every point of view, and sometimes unfair. I would suggest that the best course would be for the noble Lord, who takes a great interest in these and kindred subjects, to place on paper some definite proposal. It will not be an easy task; but if a proposal is submitted to us I will most carefully consider it myself and will ask for the consideration of my colleagues of the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01357"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to say anything in reference to what has just fallen from the noble and learned Earl, but I think that by the two speeches to which we have just listened an impression might be formed in the minds of the public without due weight being given to the position of the plaintiffs in these actions. I do not think that the noble and learned Earl in his advocacy of the rights of the public really told your Lordships the full extent to which the rights of the public in the Lough Neagh case had been extended, and it was because of that usurpation that it became necessary for the
<col>422</col>
plaintiff to take the action which he did. The noble and learned Earl said a moment or two ago that the law, while being very scrupulous with regard to private property, had not, been, perhaps, so careful in safeguarding public rights.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01358"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: May I say that that observation was not intended to reflect upon the litigants in either of these cases. I was most anxious to avoid doing that. It was a general observation in regard to the history of the law, and since the noble Viscount has referred to it may I say that I believe in the Lough Neagh case the landowners who have established their rights do not intend to exercise them to the full at all events. It is very difficult, in a case which took eight days to hear the evidence, to give more than the most general expression of what the case was. I have not desired to express the smallest criticism or censure upon the litigants in either of these cases, and I hope the noble Viscount will understand that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01359"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Nothing could be more clear than the noble and learned Earl's determination not to cast any reflection on the decision, although he explained his own position very clearly. It is only fair to the plaintiff to say, with regard to this public right, whatever it; was, that it had been in reality only exercised since the lease was granted, for which he had paid &#x00A3;8,000, and in respect of which he was liable to pay in addition a very large sum annually; and this public user had been so developed that it nullified the whole advantage of the contract which he had entered into in taking up the lease. I do not think the noble and learned Earl mentioned to your Lordships the fact that up to 1905 no eel fishing had been carried on. Practically until a year or two ago there had been no eel fishing, but of late the fishing had been so extended, whole bridges of boats being utilised for the purpose, that the plaintiffs were forced to take this step. From the decision of the learned Judge in Ireland and from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ireland it was made perfectly clear that such a development of the public right practically resulted in the nullifying of the whole of the advantage of the private right for which Captain O'Neill had paid a large sum, and which was undoubtedly the property of the riparian owner to that extent. I have
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0216"/>
<col>423</col>
made this point clear because I think the effect of the noble Lord's speech would be to give an idea that the owner, not being the landlord but the lessor, had attempted to drive out the public from something which they had enjoyed from time immemorial, whereas in fact he was merely endeavouring to establish his own right against a usurpation which had only grown up in the last few years, and which, if allowed, would have had the effect of transferring to the public generally the right which belonged to him and for which he had paid a considerable sum of money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01360"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely dispute the statement made by the noble Viscount. So far as I have been able to learn the facts, they are these. For centuries these fishermen had fished for eels all over the lough. Some few years ago the Conservancy Board for that district made a new regulation under which eel fishing in certain parts of the lough was prohibited. In 1905 the fishermen succeeded in getting the by-law to that effect displaced. They went to law, and got a mandamus from the Court requiring the Board to allow the eel fishery to go on as it had done from ancient days. In consequence of that, since the year 1905 there has been a reversion to the fishermen of the eel fishery which they had enjoyed in previous years. In that case I think the argument of the noble Viscount falls to the ground. I can only say, with regard to the Lord Chancellor's speech, that I thank him for the attention he has given to the subject and for the suggestion he has made. He has put the onus upon me of drawing up a proposal, a somewhat difficult task, but I will endeavour to do it to the best of my ability.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01361"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no desire to take part in this discussion, as I sat judicially in both of the eases to which the noble Lord referred. He has rather invited your Lordships to sit in judgment on the decision that was given in one of those cases. It is obvious that it would be quite out of place for me to say anything with regard to the decisions which have been given; they are now recorded in the Law Reports and speak for themselves. The judgment which I gave was, I may say, very carefully prepared as the result of much thought, and so were the judgments of the other learned Lords who took part in the
<col>424</col>
decision. There never were two cases more closely examined into and jealously scrutinised on both sides than these two cases, and I am not at all prepared to accept the statement of the noble and learned Earl in reference to the last case he spoke of. Whenever a suggestion is brought forward for legislation on this matter it will, of course, receive the attention it needs, and, as the noble and learned Earl has very fairly said, whenever such a case comes up the question will necessarily at once arise as to the preservation of vested interests. It is obvious that no Bill could ignore vested interests and legal rights; they would have to be considered and dealt with by compensation and otherwise. That is an obvious fact which will lie at the root of every consideration which is sought to be applied to this question.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01364"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill, which has passed the House of Commons without any comment, is of a very simple nature. Its object is to remedy a difficulty which has arisen with regard to the interpretation of the Moneylenders Act of 1900. The effect of Section 2 of that Act is that any agreement with or security taken by a moneylender otherwise than in his registered name is void, and this also applies in the case of any other person having dealings with him. That point is dealt with. Then it is proposed to restrict the use of the word "bank." In the past there have been many cases of fraud in this respect. Moneylenders were able, by setting up as bankers, to obtain large sums of money from small depositors and persons who thought they were dealing with a recognised bank instead of with a moneylender. I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything more with regard to the Bill, and I move that it be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

believe I have had more experience of troops being quartered upon my land than anybody in this House, residing as I do near to Aldershot. Troops have gone through my woods frequently, and my property has never on any occasion sustained damage. They always leave a large party behind them to fill up any holes that may have been made and take away all the debris, and the last time they came to me they posted a sentry over the gardens and the stables and the entry to the woods&#x2014;in fact, over any part that I wished to retain the privacy of; and, as I say, I have never sustained the slightest injury or damage from the presence of troops. Lord Down-shire, my immediate neighbour, recently had a large body of troops quartered on his property, and he sustained so little damage and inconvenience from their presence that he voluntarily invited a large body of Yeomanry to come to him the next year. With regard to the suggestion that troops disturb the game, nobody shoots until November. The troops come in August, and therefore if the pheasants have been disturbed at all they have plenty of time by November to get back to their covers. I can assure the House that the visit of the troops is very popular in my neighbourhood, and I have never heard of any proprietor sustaining damage either to his woods or his game or his property during man&#x0153;uvres.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01412">The noble Lord, in moving his first Amendment, said: I have put down the Amendment standing in my name with the object of finding out whether the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill will give us some assurance as to the closing of main roads. They can be closed for six hours under the Bill now before the House. To close main roads for such a length of time in these days would be a very drastic proceeding indeed, considering the great amount of through traffic there now is. In 1897 motor cars had not come into existence and our main roads were used then principally for local purposes. Now-a-days they are used for through traffic, not only by the more expensive kinds of motor cars, but by motor cyclists (and ordinary cyclists) and many commercial forms of motor traffic, and the closing of our main roads to-clay would mean as great an inconvenience as the closing of a main line of a railway. I am sure the House will agree with me in thinking that this is an important point, and one which we cannot well pass over without some assurance from the Government on the subject.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01414"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Lord is justified in asking for some information about this. It would be very mischievous if we intended to interfere with main roads in the fashion which has given rise to the apprehension in the noble Lord's mind, but that is not the case. We are forced to take the power because it is impossible to say what is a main road and what is not, and to schedule them would be extremely difficult. I notice that the
<col>430</col>
Schedule suggested by the noble Lord does not include Ireland. That would leave Ireland in a very unhappy position. But I may tell the noble Lord that we do not propose to meddle with the main roads; on the contrary, it is most essential to leave them free for traffic; but there are cross roads which might affect the man&#x0153;uvre area which it is desirable to keep closed for a few hours. We have to take our powers in general terms because it is not easy to make certain that a cross road may not be regarded as a main road; it is a vague term. In the first place, we shall not apply in respect of main roads; and, in the second place, if we did I do not think the justices would give their authorisation. Anyhow, I think the noble Lord may rest assured that we are alive to the public mischief which would ensue if we did, and we certainly do not intend to do so. I have had a conversation with the General Staff officers who direct these proceedings, and can assure the noble Lord that we are not proposing to do more than is absolutely necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01415"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Viscount. I take it that what he has said amounts to a general undertaking that main roads will be interfered with as little as possible, and that where he closes cross roads he will give notice of the closing as far back the road as possible so that any one coming down the main road may, on approaching the area that is closed, have an opportunity of going round some other way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01416"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Lord may take it that that is the practice that will be observed. We always wish to leave as good and fragrant a recollection behind us as we possibly can, and we are anxious to maintain the good character which the noble Lord, Lord Haversham, has given us.</membercontribution></p>

I quite endorse what the noble Lord opposite (Lord Haversham) said with regard to the troops. We are only too delighted to welcome them and to give them every facility. I raised this point, not out of any unfriendliness to the Bill, but in order that some attention should be paid to the main roads and the through traffic upon them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01418"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Although I recognise the importance of the question, I think the noble Lord is quite right to trust the War Office in this matter. My recollection in carrying out the Act of 1897 is that in almost every instance the forebodings with which that Act was regarded and the inconvenience that it was expected would be caused by it, were found to be quite unjustified and absolutely without foundation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01419"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: That is quite true, and virtually this Bill represents a continuous policy. I quite agree with the noble Viscount that the working of the Act of 1897 falsified all the sinister apprehensions that were expressed with regard to it. I hear on all hands that the conduct of the troops during man&#x0153;uvres has been admirable throughout, and I think both officers and men, if I may say so, are increasingly aware of how important it is to them to have the welcome and the goodwill of the public. I can only say, in support of what fell from my noble friend Lord Haversham, that on the small property I have in Perthshire I had a very large number of troops for the size of the property quartered there for a week, and I am sure that a more orderly and considerate set of men and a more thoughtful body of officers you could not find, and I think that is the general experience of those who throw their land open to the military.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE INSURANCE BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01437"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether, when the Insurance Bill is presented to this House, they will have a copy of the Bill printed to show&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. The variations which have been made in the Bill during its passage through the House of Commons; and</li>
<li>2. Those clauses which by operation of the various forms of closure now in use in that House have been passed without any discussion;</li>
</ol>
and to ask whether it will be possible now to state the estimated cost of the proposals contained in the Bill, and the number of new officials who will have to be appointed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01438">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in putting these Questions I suppose it is hardly necessary for me to disclaim any idea of raising upon them any controversial debate on this matter. In fact, I do not desire to raise any debate of any kind. I am purely desirous of information, and I can say for myself that when this Bill was introduced I did my best to understand it and for a time to follow the discussions which took place upon it. But however much time one gave to it and however much one desired to take a really intelligent course in following the discussions which went on, one found it absolutely impossible to understand the changes that were being made. Whatever view one may hold, the subject is one of enormous magnitude and very great complexity.</p>
<col>434</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01439">I am not, of course, in the secrets of noble Lords on the other side, but it seems not improbable that this House will be asked to deal with the Bill within an extremely limited time. It has been decided that it is not a Finance Bill, and therefore I suppose some responsibility is expected to lie upon this House to see, as far as the House is given an opportunity of seeing, that the Bill is passed in an intelligible and consistent form. It is quite obvious that if the first two Questions which stand in my name can be answered by such a print as I suggest, the task, the almost impossible task, which is being laid on your Lordships will be made, at any rate to some extent, simpler than it would otherwise be. That is the sole reason which actuated me in putting down these Questions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01440">With regard to the last of the Questions, whether it is possible now to state the estimated cost of the proposals contained in the Bill and the number of new officials who will have to be appointed, it seems to me that we are entitled to have this information before we make ourselves responsible for the scheme. No doubt we are not responsible for finance. But I assume that the Government know, after all the changes that have been made, what the cost is likely to be that the public funds will have to bear and the responsibility which the State is taking upon itself in inaugurating this scheme; because it is quite obvious that if the scheme is once passed, if the bill is, so to speak, once drawn, to use commercial language, the country will have to pay the cost whatever it is. It would be interesting if we could ascertain whether the Government have any really consistent view of what the cost is likely to be. If they have&#x2014;I do not put the alternative if they have not, because I can hardly conceive it possible&#x2014;if they have, I can see no reason why your Lordships and the public should not be given the information.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01441"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Questions put by the noble Lord are, in our opinion, perfectly justifiable. All the cardinal and leading points in the Insurance Bill raise questions which, as the noble Lord said, are of great magnitude and complexity; and this House, although the time, unfortunately, appears likely to be short in which the House will have to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0222"/>
<col>435</col>
exercise its function of supervision, ought not to be placed at any disadvantage, but ought to have before it all the material which would conduce to a sound judgment.<lb/>
In his first Question the noble Lord asks whether the Government will have a copy of the Bill printed to show the variations which have been made in the Bill during its passage through the House of Commons. The answer is that, though it will be a very elaborate process, both in preparation and in the mechanical business of printing, His Majesty's Government propose to have a copy printed showing the variations that have been made in the Bill during its passage through its various stages in the House of Commons. I can assure the noble Lord that we have given this matter most careful consideration, in spite of the mechanical difficulties and others that were interposed, and we hope we shall be able to comply with the noble Lord's request.<lb/>
The second Question is a little less simple. The noble Lord wants to have placed on the Table of the House a Paper containing those clauses which, by the operation of the various forms of closure now in use in the House of Commons, have been passed without any discussion. I would point out, and I am sure the noble Lord will see this point, that to distinguish those clauses which were put under the Closure Resolution would be, or would run the risk, at all events, of being rather misleading, for this reason. The great majority of those clauses deal with points that had already been discussed before the clauses were passed into the Bill, and they merely represent, in their final shape, decisions arrived at as the result of previous discussion. Therefore, though the closure might have struck off further discussion, that does not at all mean that there had not been adequate and ample discussion at other stages. I will give the noble Lord an instance. Take the first of the new clauses which went under the guillotine &#x2014;and this is, I think, a very fair case to take&#x2014;the clause with reference to the peculiar arrangements in the case of small societies. That clause was guillotined, but the principle of it was discussed first on Clause 5 of the original Bill, and secondly on Clause 18, when a whole day was given to a discussion of it. To print that clause &#x2014;and I merely take it as an instance&#x2014;in a distinctive way in order to show that
<col>436</col>
it had not been discussed in Committee would be to give an impression which, in the opinion of the Government, would be completely opposed to the real facts of the case. I will not trouble your Lordships with other instances, though they could easily be multiplied&#x2014;I mean where the discussion, though obstructed or not taking place in the Committee stage, still had taken place in other parts of the deliberations on the Bill. The Committee stage&#x2014;I would really commend this to the noble Lord if he has in his mind, as I am pretty clear he has, that the discussion was somewhat truncated ill another place&#x2014;the Committee stage of this Bill, exclusive of Part II, which, as your Lordships know, was considered with great expedition and with satisfaction, I think, to everybody in Grand Committee&#x2014;occupied thirty days of Parliamentary time, and there was hardly any point, so I am informed by those who followed it through all its stages in the House of Commons, that did not at one time or another receive ample and adequate consideration.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord asks a very important Question&#x2014;whether it is possible now to state the estimated cost of the proposals contained in the Bill. I am not at this moment. in a position to state the exact estimated cost of the proposals contained in the Bill, but I can assure the noble Lord that the actuaries are at this moment, and have been for some time, engaged in preparing a fully and carefully revised estimate of the cost, and I understand that the information desired by the noble Lord will be ready almost immediately. I assume that the noble Lord, when he talks of cost means the cost to the Government&#x2014;in other words, that he does not mean the gross cost.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01442"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: It would obviously be impossible to obtain the gross amount either of the workers' contributions or of the employers' contributions, as you cannot possibly know the numbers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01443"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I felt sure that the noble Lord did not mean the cost including the employers' and the workers' contributions. But I can say this to him, that a comprehensive estimate of the whole charges&#x2014;it can only be an estimate, but it will be a full and comprehensive estimate&#x2014;is now being prepared and will very shortly be laid before Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0223"/>
<col>437</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01444"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDERSON</member><membercontribution>: I venture to remind the noble Viscount that there is already an actuarial estimate of the probable amount of the contributions by employers and employed. I suppose if that is altered in any way the alteration will be indicated in the new estimate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01445"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the variations which have been made in this Bill, when we come to see them, will be almost innumerable, and I am afraid that a return simply of the variations would be a very long and complex document and would not convey very much information. I do not know whether it is in order, but might I ask whether the Government would not only produce a statement showing the variations which have been made, but would also give us an explanatory memorandum with regard to the Bill and divide that memorandum under certain heads. For instance, take the doctors, the friendly societies, and other heads of that sort. There have been several changes both with regard to the doctors and the friendly societies. At one time the friendly societies were apparently placated, upon which the doctors again rose in rebellion, and so on; and there have been several settlements or supposed settlements which have turned out not to be in any way final or satisfactory to the persons concerned. It would be of value to know how the succession of changes that have been made with regard to the various classes of persons who are interested in the scheme came to be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01446"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was glad to notice that the noble Viscount admitted readily that my noble friend was amply justified in asking for this information, and that he recognised that his Questions were not prompted by mere idle curiosity. With regard to the answers given by the noble Viscount, we are grateful to him for undertaking to supply us with full information as to the variations which have been made in the Bill during its passage through the House of Commons. My noble friend who has just spoken would like to supplement that by a kind of historical or explanatory memorandum which would have the effect of placing before us in consecutive shape the origin and history of some of those somewhat protean changes. We should be delighted to have such a document, but I am bound to say that I think its preparation during the course of the next few
<col>438</col>
days would severely tax the powers of research and the ingenuity of the official entrusted with the compilation of the Paper.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount gave us a reason for which a return in accordance with the second of my noble friend's suggestions might be somewhat misleading. He told us that many of the clauses which had been passed without discussion represented the outcome of prolonged debates, and that it would be misleading to represent them as having never been considered by the House of Commons at all. That, I think, is a perfectly just observation; but I still do not see why it should not be possible, in the special print of the Bill which will be prepared, to indicate, by a red line or otherwise, those clauses which, in fact, have not been discussed at all. If any of us suggested that a particular clause had not been adequately considered, it would be easy for the noble Viscount to point to the history of the clause and show that it was to some extent an agreed clause; but a, number of these undiscussed clauses are by no means agreed clauses, but represent proposals which have been sprung on Parliament and have never been directly or indirectly discussed at all.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has, I think, met my noble friend very fairly in regard to the proposal that we should be supplied with an estimate of the cost of the proposals contained in the Bill. I am afraid that for myself I do not attach very much importance to these official estimates. We have had some experience of them, and the conclusion to which I am inclined to come is that no amount of actuarial research will give you a result which can be accepted as beyond all proof establishing that the expenditure to be incurred will remain within certain limits. The only other observation I wish to make is that the noble Viscount omitted altogether to notice the last suggestion made by my noble friend, that we should have a statement of the number of new officials to be appointed. That is an item to which personally I attach a great deal of importance. There is no doubt that the creation of new official appointments has lately been proceeding at a fast and furious rate, and I hope that as the noble Viscount has met my noble friend on the other points he will be able to satisfy him upon this point also.</membercontribution></p>

<col>439</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01447"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I am not able to satisfy the noble Lord on that point, which I ought to have mentioned. The Commissioners who will have the administration of this Act will find out from experience what number of officials will be required, and it is impossible for us at present to give even an estimate, or anything more than a very loose or useless estimate. The demand made by the noble Earl opposite is, I think, a perfectly reasonable one in itself if it could be complied with. It would be an enormous facilitation to the discussion, limited as it will be inevitably in this House, if there were a statement of that kind&#x2014;a statement, for example, which is, I understand, what the noble Earl desires, of what the doctors say, what the housemaids say, what the friendly societies say, and so on. But, as the noble Marquess sees, it would take a great deal of time and a great deal of pressure of mind to state that in a short, simple, and explicit way. But I will consult my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and do the best I can to persuade him that it would be desirable to give this information if it is reasonably possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01448"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount spoke of a statement showing what the doctors say, what the housemaids say, what the friendly societies say, and so on. It is not that that I want. What I want is a statement as to what proposals were originally made with regard to doctors and also with regard to housemaids and so on, and how many times and when and how those proposals have been altered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01449"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I submit to the noble Earl that all that would be rather old history and purely academic.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01450"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Not at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01451"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I should have thought, with all deference and respect, that the object of the House of Lords would be to supervise a measure sent up to it from the House of Commons. For purposes of debate it is, of course, lawful to demonstrate inconsistencies. So be it. But to print all the first form of the Bill and contrast that in printed form with the shape that the Bill has ultimately assumed is, I think, too historic and too academic.
<col>440</col>
But, as I say, I will do the best I can to get the view of the noble Earl met.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01452"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be wanting in courtesy if I did not express my acknowledgments to the noble Viscount for the way he has met my request for information. But because a clause has been tabled by the promoters of the Bill and is intended&#x2014;genuinely intended&#x2014;to meet criticisms which have been already passed on the original clause, it must not be assumed that it has met the objections to the original clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01453"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I never for one moment meant to say that the clauses that now appear in the Bill are agreed clauses. I never meant that.</membercontribution></p>

<title>AGRICULTURAL EXPENDITURE IN<lb/> SCOTLAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01454"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture the total amount spent by the Board during the last completed year for the purposes of agriculture and forestry in Scotland. This Question is based on the assumption that the accounts of the Board of Agriculture are kept in such a way that the expenditure upon England and Scotland can be shown separately. I am anxious to learn what is the actual amount spent in Scotland upon all departments of agriculture under the control of the Board of Agriculture. I have asked in my Question only for the total sum, but it would be an additional favour if the noble Lord could tell me how it is divided up among the more important works&#x2014;works carried out under the Feeding Stuffs Act, agricultural education, agricultural colleges, the money spent for research and experiment, and so on. Indeed, in all those cases where the Board of Agriculture are spending money in Scotland I should be glad to know if the noble Lord could include the amount in his answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01455"><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is a certain difficulty, as the noble Lord will readily understand, in separating the accounts for Scotland and those for England. In a Return asked for by Mr. John Dillon in the House of Commons in
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0225"/>
<col>441</col>
July of this year that part of the expenses of the Board of Agriculture which might be considered as directly attributable to Scotland was given in round figures as &#x00A3;15,500. I can give the noble Lord the main items, but of course he will understand that it is a little difficult to estimate these figures exactly. Take the case, for instance, of the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act. You can say exactly what the cost is of the number of inspectors allocated to Scotland, what they cost the Board in the matter of salaries, and so on. Under that head the cost is &#x00A3;3,750, but that does not take into account other expenses which have to be considered. For instance, if you are trying to make out what the administration of the Act costs you have to allow a certain proportion of the salaries of the head veterinary officers and so on at the Board of Agriculture. In round figures that is estimated at about &#x00A3;5,000. Salaries and wages are the largest of all, and they come to &#x00A3;9,960; travelling expenses come to &#x00A3;2,700, and the collection of statistics to &#x00A3;1,085. These go pretty far to make up the total sum. They at any rate are the principal heads of the expenditure as far as it can be calculated, and I hope the information meets the noble Lord's point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01456"><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: Can my noble friend inform the House how many inspectors of the Board there are at the present moment in Scotland purely for Scottish purposes?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01458"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Lord for his answer; but surely there is, in addition to the amounts he has mentioned, a considerable sum spent on agricultural education.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01459"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: That does not come under the Board of Agriculture.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01461"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The Board of Agriculture has nothing to do with that at the present time. I think it is entirely administered by the Scottish Office.</membercontribution></p>
<col>442</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01462"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> rose to ask the Secretary for Scotland what sums he estimates will be available from the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund for the purposes set forth in the Small Landholders (Scotland) Bill, Clause 4 (2), (3), (4), and (5).</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01463">The noble Lord said: My Lords, as we have just learned from the noble Lord who represents the Board of Agriculture, the ordinary expenses of the Board do not include a considerable number of those items which apparently will be chargeable to the proposed new Board of Agriculture in Scotland. The mall Landholders (Scotland) Bill provides that a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;185,000 is to be annually voted by Parliament for the whole of the purposes of the Bill. Section 6 of the Bill provides that this Fund&#x2014;the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund&#x2014;shall be applied for the following purposes, namely, for the purposes of facilitating the constitution of new landholders' holdings, the enlargement of landholders' holdings, and the improvement and rebuilding of dwelling-houses or other buildings of landholders and cottars in terms of the Landholders Acts. That apparently is the first matter for which this money is to be used.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01464">In addition to that, the Fund is to be applied to meet the requirements of the Congested Districts Board and for the purpose of exercising the other powers and duties which will be transferred from the Board of Agriculture under the Order of the Secretary for Scotland to the new Board which is to be set up in Scotland. Those purposes, of course, are not yet defined, but we see that they are to cover matters of very large importance, such as the general duty of promoting agriculture, forestry, rural industries, etc., and also the collection of statistics relating to these purposes for research, experiment, and instruction, and the promotion and development of agricultural organisation and co-operation. Those are all matters of great importance to us agriculturally in Scotland, and what we fear is that when the prior claims under this Bill for the purpose of small holdings are satisfied, we may find that an inadequate amount of money will be left for these other purposes of the Board of Agriculture.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01465">There are in Scotland considerable objections to a grant which is absolutely fixed and out of which a variety of possibly
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0226"/>
<col>443</col>
conflicting interests have to be satisfied, particularly when there is no allocation made for those particular interests in the granting of the money itself. The Government will probably recollect the case, with which we were very familiar in Scotland, of the incidence of the Residue Grant. The residue of certain licences was paid to the Local Taxation Account, and that was diminished every year by sums required for the purpose of the Diseases of Animals Act. The balance remaining was utilised on technical education, and we used to have the extraordinary result that the more swine fever we had in the country the less technical education we were able to carry out. It was a very objectionable feature, and I fear very much that we may have the same sort of result under this Bill&#x2014;that the more small holdings are created the less money we shall be able to get for the ordinary purposes of agriculture. Important as small holdings are, they are of relatively small importance compared to the real great interest of agriculture as a national industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01466">We are proud in Scotland of the very high standard to which we have reached in agriculture. We are, we understand, far ahead of the world in that respect. But the time has come, and really has long since arrived, when we do require a great deal more consideration paid to agricultural education, particularly in the way of research and experiment. At the present moment we are probably behind any other country in the world in the attention and assistance paid to any of those objects. We are anxious to have increased expenditure in all these directions; and though the Secretary for Scotland may tell us that the present allocation is sufficient actually for the moment, it is more than likely that it would be quite inadequate if these industries are set going and attended to, and there is no provision in the Bill for giving us larger funds. Forestry will demand under this Bill considerable assistance. We hope something will be done at all events in the way of agricultural organisation and co-operation and also in the direction of many rural industries, but we fear very much that under this scheme the work of the Board of Agriculture, the legitimate work which has to be carried out in Scotland, may be stereotyped to such a degree that all these newer purposes may be almost starved. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01467"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am gratified to find that the noble Lord is so heartily at one with us in our endeavours to develop this kind of work which will fall to the proposed Board of Agriculture in Scotland. In the first place, may I make one correction The Fund will amount, not to &#x00A3;185,000, but to &#x00A3;200,000. There are two sums, &#x00A3;185,000 <i>plus</i> &#x00A3;15,000; so that when we are dealing with the total sum available for the whole of Scotland we are entitled to say that the total sum available for the purposes set forth in the Small Landholders (Scotland) Bill is &#x00A3;200,000. It is not possible at this stage to frame such estimates as the noble Lord desires.<lb/>
It is quite true that under the Bill duties are laid upon the Board of Agriculture to promote forestry and other rural industries, to collect statistics, to develop inquiries, research, and experiments, and to develop instruction in order to help those industries. There is also the duty laid upon the Board of assisting agricultural organisation and co-operation. As a safeguard to the methods in which this money is applied, I may remind the noble Lord that a full report will be presented to Parliament every year, and will, of course, be subject to the criticism of Parliament. The main distinction which I wish to draw is in regard to the charges which will be laid on the public in relation to this Bill. The charges connected with the office and establishment of the Board will be laid upon the Votes in the annual Estimates and will be voted by Parliament every year, whereas the money applied for the different purposes to which the noble Lord has drawn attention will come from the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund of &#x00A3;200,000; that also will, of course, be under the full control of Parliamentary criticism.<lb/>
I may, perhaps, remove a misapprehension on the part of the noble Lord in regard to the present expenditure on agricultural education in Scotland. The agricultural colleges in Scotland, through which this work is done, are under the supervision of the Scottish Education Department, and they receive an annual grant altogether of something like &#x00A3;12,000 from central funds. It is not intended at this moment to disturb that arrangement; in fact, as years go on it is hoped that it will be possible to further encourage and develop that work, but it
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0227"/>
<col>445</col>
will not fall on this Agriculture (Scotland) Fund. It is not thought desirable to apply rigidly parts of this Fund to separate purposes. The noble Lord drew attention to the inconvenience and hardship inflicted by the Residue Grant and its distribution in Scotland; but let me point out a distinction between this and the Residue Grant. The hardship in regard to the Residue Grant was that it was a varying sum. There is no variation about this. The sum paid will be a fixed sum of &#x00A3;200,000 until Parliament in its wisdom chooses either to increase or diminish that sum; so that the hardship due to the diminution of the Residue Grant will not be present in this case. In the opinion of the Government it is safer and wiser to allow this Department to develop forestry and other rural industries as time goes on, and to be guided in applying the funds by the public demand for such development. I do not honestly think that there is any real justification for the fears expressed by the noble Lord.<lb/>
My noble friend who represents the Board of Agriculture has just stated to the House that the total annual sum now spent by that Board in Scotland may be estimated at &#x00A3;15,500. Making every possible allowance for rapid development, I think there are ample funds at the disposal of the proposed Board of Agriculture for Scotland to carry out all its purposes&#x2014;in the first place, the development of small holdings; and, in the second place, though I do not put one before the other for they are both of equal importance, the promotion of the general well-being and prosperity of all agricultural interests in Scotland. I may remind my noble friend that only recently a Development. Fund has been established under the Development Act of two years ago, and that fund, which is open to all Government Departments, will, I trust, be equally open to the Board of Agriculture which is now proposed for Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01468"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Lord for his answer, but he has not given me the figures for which I asked. It is no doubt difficult to get at them in accurate detail, but I am surprised that there is no estimate of the annual cost of promoting these small holdings at the beginning of the scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01469"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The charge made by the Congested Districts Board last year in
<col>446</col>
respect of agriculture, which includes the improvement of live stock, the development of poultry, and other agricultural industries, was between &#x00A3;8,000 and &#x00A3;9,000. Again, the charge for settlement schemes&#x2014;that is, land schemes&#x2014;was a sum of nearly &#x00A3;9,000. That makes a total of &#x00A3;17,000 annually expended on purposes of this kind at present by the Congested Districts Board, which work will fall, if the Bill passes in its present form, to the new Board of Agriculture. That is all that is being done by any authority in Scotland for that particular purpose. Then I come to forestry. All the money that is spent on forestry in Scotland now is spent largely on instruction through the agricultural colleges. That expenditure will not be disturbed. I may remind my noble friend that quite recently the Scottish Office appointed a Committee to inquire into certain matters connected with forestry in Scotland. That Committee has not reported. No doubt its recommendations will, if approved, lead to some expenditure, but how far that expenditure will fall upon the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund, and how far, for instance, it may possibly be met by the Development Fund, it is quite impossible at the present moment to state. It is difficult to forecast with any precision whatever the actual charge upon public funds which will be caused by the development of forestry in Scotland. We have set our hands to the work and we mean to pursue it, but to give any estimate now of what is likely to be the expenditure next year or the year after is really very difficult. But an examination of what is at present spent and what is likely to be required in the immediate future will bear out my assertion that there are ample funds for all the purposes undertaken by the Bill; and the noble Lord may rest assured that, if these funds in time to come are not sufficient, those who represent the Board of Agriculture for Scotland will come to Parliament for increased funds.</membercontribution></p>

I have already pointed out that the establishment expenses of this Department will fall, not upon the &#x00A3;200,000, but upon the annual moneys laid before Parliament in the Estimates and voted by Parliament; so that that, as the noble Earl will appreciate, does not enter into the estimate which Lord Clinton desires to have from me.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01486"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that the noble and learned Earl has put this question, as I am sure the House is naturally interested in knowing the course of business before it. I will state how we think it well for the business to proceed. During the course of this week we expect to receive from another place three important measures&#x2014;namely, the Coal Mines Bill, the Naval Prize Bill, and the National Insurance Bill. I hope that the Coal Mines Bill and the Naval Prize Bill will reach their last stages respectively in another place to-morrow. In that case we would propose to read those two Bills in this House a first time to-morrow evening. The National Insurance Bill
<col>450</col>
will reach your Lordships' House, if all goes well, on Wednesday next, December 6. I trust that it will meet with your Lordships' convenience to take the Second Reading of the Naval Prize Bill on Wednesday next, the 6th instant, and the Second Reading of the Coal Mines Bill on Thursday, the 7th. I ought to mention that on Thursday next the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, proposes to call attention to the state of affairs in Persia and to inquire as to the policy of His Majesty's Government, but I understand from hint that the discussion need not be a long one. My idea would be, subject to your Lordships' approval, that Lord Curzon's Motion upon Persia might be taken before we proceed to other business on Thursday. We could then go on with the Coal Mines Bill after the Persian discussion was over. We propose asking the House to take the Second Reading of the National Insurance Bill on Monday, the 11th instant. It is, of course, our confident hope, as it is that of the whole House, that the Prorogation should take place before Christmas, and supposing that we sit on Friday, December 8, and on Friday and Saturday, December 15 and 16 respectively, as I think the House might be disposed to do, that would give us&#x2014;though I am afraid it is not a large, figure&#x2014;between to-morrow and the 19th ten working days. There will be a few Bills of minor importance which will come before your Lordships which have already been mentioned by the Prime Minister in another place, but with the important or unimportant exception of the Finance Bill, I have mentioned the principal measures which will be submitted to your Lordships before the end of the session.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01501"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: This question was a good deal discussed in the Committee, and I think by a very large majority we came to the conclusion that the Amendment was not only unnecessary but unworkable. There is protection given for these cases by the clause giving full discretion to the Court as regards costs as well as damages. The origin of the provision requiring performing rights to be expressly reserved were the proceedings in old days of certain persons who made a rather illegitimate use of the right which then existed to sue for a penalty. Consequently an amending Statute was passed in 1882 to prevent their operations, and the provision to which the noble Lord refers was introduced for that purpose. But it was found to be unworkable, for the reason that the author of a song, for instance, very seldom has control over the printing, and it is impossible for him to see whether the word "Copyright" is put on or not. Moreover, it was found that the provision did not stop the operations of those who brought actions in order to extract blackmail. But those operations were stopped by the subsequent introduction of the clause giving the Court control over costs and damages, and we have incorporated that clause in this Bill. On the other side there is this very great difficulty. The Berlin Convention has laid down that all technicalities such as registration are to be got rid of by the great Powers which are giving each other the benefit of their copyright system, and if we inserted this Amendment in the Bill we should be excluded from a large number of the benefits derived under the Berlin Convention.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01516"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I agree with the noble Viscount; but I think I can give an assurance which will remove the difficulty which the noble Earl feels. A contract of service means a contract which creates the relationship of employer and employed. If you merely give a commission to an architect or sculptor to produce a design or a bust for you that, does not create the relationship of employer and employed between the parties. Therefore I think the noble Earl may take it that in that respect his doubt is allayed. The scheme of the clause is to declare quite clearly for the future that the author of a work is the first owner of the copyright. To that two exceptions are made. There is the definite case of a commission, and the case of a contract of service; and there
<col>456</col>
is another point to which the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, is going to call attention with which we are ready to deal. Lord St. Aldwyn may rest assured that we have no intention of departing from what is the great principle of this clause; and the question which the noble Earl put to me is one which, I think, is capable of a satisfactory solution consistently with the clause.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01519"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member> moved the insertion in Clause 5 of a new proviso, that "Where in the case of an architectural design or drawing for the erection or restoration of any building, the design or drawing was ordered by some other person and the author was paid for superintending such erection or restoration, then, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the person by whom such design or drawing was ordered shall be the first owner of the copyright."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01520">The noble Viscount said: I have given notice of this Amendment in order to raise again a point which I raised when we were discussing this Bill in Committee, and with regard to which the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill promised consideration. I confess that I hoped from what, he said that he would have been able himself to place an Amendment on the Paper to meet what I wished, but he has not done so, and I fear, from what he has told me, that he will not be able to agree to this Amendment. This Bill for the first time gives copyright to the profession of architects. I confess it seems to me very doubtful whether they ought to have been admitted to copyright at all. The profession is by no means an ill-paid profession, because when an architect has made a design for which he is employed by some other person, he is, after having made the design, employed to carry out the work at a very considerable percentage of the total cost of that work. Therefore I maintain that he receives as much remuneration in such cases as he is at all entitled to. As the Bill now stands, the architect would not only receive that remuneration, but if the employer who had paid him, and fully paid him, for his work, desired to repeat that work in
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0233"/>
<col>457</col>
another building, he would be obliged to pay what really I must call blackmail to the architect for the copyright of the designs. The case that occurred to me was this. A landowner, or a local authority, or a municipal authority, might desire to erect cottages or artisans' dwellings. They would naturally obtain from an architect plans for the first of those dwellings. They would employ that architect to superintend their erection, and he would be paid for the work. They might then desire to repeat that design to a very considerable extent, and in that case, as the Bill now stands, they would have to make a payment to the architect on every cottage or artisan's dwelling they built on the same plan whether they employed the architect again or not. It is a difficult matter, as everybody knows, to build houses of this kind at a cost which will as a pecuniary investment recoup those who undertake them, and this is really an additional burden to be imposed by Parliament on the cost of these houses. I maintain that as the Bill now stands the interest of the public has not been sufficiently considered. Therefore, my Lords, I have ventured to propose in this Amendment that a third exception to the general rule shall be made.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01522"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount first raised this point in Committee, and I was struck with the individual cases which he gave and undertook to set to work to see whether, consistently with the principle of the Bill, I could find some words which would cover these cases without destroying the principle. I regret to say that after the most careful consultation with the experts I have wholly failed to do so. The principle of this Bill is to give to the architect copyright, which he has not had up to now. It was thought wrong that if an architect was employed to design a cathedral, for instance, or a beautiful house, and had at great pains
<col>458</col>
made a design for that purpose and the person who employed him to do so did not carry out the design, or, having carried it out, wished to set up another, that the artistic work, which was the creation of the architect's brain just as much as literary copyright would be, should pass from the architect unless the person who commissioned him had stipulated to obtain it. We felt that the root principle of this Bill was to bring in architecture as one of the Fine Arts for which copyright might be secured, and there has been a great response to that among architects themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01523"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01524"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: That, of course, is natural; but it is not wrong. They may be quite right in asking that the creation of their art should be protected just as much as in the case of the sculptor or painter or man of letters. That is the position which architects have taken up, and that is the position which the Government have accepted in this Bill. The Amendment which the noble Viscount has placed on the Paper takes the copyright from the architect and gives it, quite contrary to the principle of the Bill, to somebody else, and so difficult is it for him to make a working Amendment that he has to add something else. He provides that there are to be two conditions&#x2014;where the design was ordered by some other person and the author was paid for superintending the erection. I quite agree that ought to come in. But see the awkwardness of it. Instead of the copyright remaining in one place it remains with the architect until the cheque is given him in payment, and then it shifts from the architect to somebody else. Difficulties of that kind are inevitable if you try to go into the simple principle with which Clause 5 begins&#x2014;that the copyright is to be in the author of every kind of artistic design except in the two cases in which it is taken out.<lb/>
After all, there is a very simple remedy for this case. When the Bill is passed the public will know, or will get to know, the law, and if anybody wishes to have a design which he may use hereafter, for instance for the erection of houses, all he has to do is what every owner of a journal does at the present time when he buys an article and wants to have the copyright. He
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0234"/>
<col>459</col>
says, sometimes on the back of the cheque, that the copyright is to belong to the proprietor of the journal. It is the simplest thing in the world. In a great many cases the person commissioning an architect will wish to have the copyright, and in those cases he has only got to draft a few simple words to secure to himself the right to call for an assignment afterwards. Architects have suffered very great hardships up to now from having no copyright. The Bill proposes to give them copyright. If you take the copyright away from them, which the Amendment proposes in a most sweeping way to do, you get into a much greater series of difficulties than those with which you are left confronted by the clause as it stands. What you are left confronted with is this, that for the future anybody who wishes to reproduce a building for which he has commissioned an architect to produce a design he must say, in the letter to the architect, "I wish to have the copyright of this design." The Bill will pass, we hope, and the public will get to know of this, and it will be the practice in these cases, as it is already in a great many other cases, for this to be done. It is far better that people should have to take a little trouble than that you should destroy the whole principle which lies at the root of this provision with regard to architects&#x2014;namely, that at last we are going to give architects the recognition of their right to the creation of their own brains in the same way as we have done it in the case of other artistic persons.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01529"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I am glad the noble Viscount does not propose to accept the Amendment which has just been moved. I know there are very great difficulties in dealing fairly with everybody concerned, but I venture to think that the noble Viscount behind me (Lord St. Aldwyn) is not quite fair to the architects in this case. His Amendment would put architects in a worse position than they are in without this Bill, because by a decision of Mr. Justice Ridley in 1904, in the case of Gibbon <i>v</i>. Pease, it was held that under the present law the person who commissioned an architect to design a building was entitled to have the drawings, but that the architect himself, who would naturally keep copies and tracings of all the drawings, was entitled, if he desired at some subsequent date to reproduce any part of them, to do so. Under this Amendment if it were incorporated in the Bill he would part with the right of ever reproducing anything that he had designed, because the copyright would pass to the person who had given him the commission. The Government have thought, and rightly, that architects ought not to be left out of the Copyright Bill altogether. It would, I think be very hard to put them, as the Amendment would do, actually in a worse position than they are in at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01530"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount who moved the Amendment now before the House felt that the interests of architects had been regarded in the construction of this clause and that the interests of the public had been neglected. I am afraid that criticism applies to a good deal in the Bill. The public has not been sufficiently considered with respect to many of its provisions. The noble Viscount in charge of the Bill said that there was an easy escape out of the difficulty which Lord St. Aldwyn had suggested; that the employer could contract to secure the right of reproducing the work, and that therefore the matter might be left as it stands&#x2014;namely, that the copyright should remain with the architect. But I submit that the law ought to conform to common sense. The real question here is whether you are laying down the law in a way which conforms to common sense.<lb/>
I think I can suggest to the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill a way of meeting the difficulty which would satisfy
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0235"/>
<col>461</col>
the noble Viscount opposite and at the same tune be consistent with what Lord Haldane says is the main principle of the Bill. Let the architect have his copyright and let that copyright remain with the architect whatever it is worth, meeting thereby the observation made by the noble Earl opposite. But let it not be an infringement of that copyright if the person for whom the design has been produced, and who has employed the architect to superintend the works under that design, uses the design afterwards. That would reserve to the person concerned&#x2014;it may be an individual or a local authority&#x2014;the right of reproduction. That I think, would satisfy what Lord Haldane calls the main principle of the Bill, and would also remove the difficulties and pitfalls which would certainly be set to many persons who give architects commissions and would not be prepared for the device of securing by contract that which they ought to secure by the operation of the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01531"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I quite felt when I placed this Amendment on the Paper that it was open to objection. I had no wish, however, to place architects in a worse position than they have been in under the present law, and if Lord Plymouth is right in saying that the Amendment does that I should not wish to press it. But I would ask the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill to consider the suggestion which has just been made by Lord Courtney. Surely the person who has employed the architect&#x2014;limited, if you like, to smaller buildings such as I have had principally in mind, artisans' dwellings and the like&#x2014;ought to be able to construct other buildings of a similar kind without any infringement of the architect's copyright. That would be, as far as I am concerned, a satisfactory settlement of the question. I feel that, although the noble Viscount is right in saying that it is possible for an employer and architect to contract themselves out of the Bill and to reserve the copyright to the employer, very few people who employ architects will be acquainted with this new law for some little time to come, and there may be cases of considerable hardship in which persons have not contracted themselves out of the Bill because they have not the least idea of the position which this Bill gives to architects with regard to the possession of copyright.

In the latter case it would be unjust that a person who had contracted to get a cathedral built should be able to reproduce the architect's designs in which there might have been as much artistic and original work as in a great picture.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01535">The noble Viscount said: In Committee on the Bill I tried to suggest words with regard to the position of those who contribute to newspapers under a contract or salary, and the Government admitted that there was some difficulty in putting a man in the position that because he had been paid a certain salary he was to lose, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, all claim to the copyright. The Government have now suggested words which I have placed on the Paper which will meet that difficulty. But I think it will be felt that possibly the words which they have suggested are a little wide. The words leave things in this position, that where a work is a contribution to a newspaper, magazine, or similar periodical, the copyright, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, shall be in the hands of the author. That has been held by some newspaper proprietors to be likely to cover the reporting of speeches, which, as I daresay is well known, is carried out by a circle very often of ten or twelve reporters, and those reports are copied into
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0236"/>
<col>463</col>
other newspapers, for which, of course, no authority is needed from the reporters themselves. Everybody would wish to safeguard to proper extent the work of the reporters, but it would certainly be a change from the existing practice to attempt to lay down that a man who has reported under a contract of service should have the copyright. The one object which I had in suggesting words in Committee was to provide that the existing admirable practice and good understanding between proprietors and the authors of contributions should not be disturbed. I therefore propose to amend this Amendment so that it would read, "but where the work is an article or other contribution to a newspaper, magazine, or similar periodical," etc. I believe those words would meet the view of the noble Viscount, and they have been accepted by persons representing the proprietors and have been seen and concurred in by those who represent the authors.</p>

No doubt the noble Viscount will point out that under the Bill as proposed copyright is to be given by each country on the same terms to foreigners as to its own subjects. But here in England we have had a very cheap and expeditious form of copyright, which is achieved by registering any publication at Stationers' Hall, and that very cheap and expeditious form of copyrighting a work has received the approbation of all parties concerned. I have had quite an unexpected number of letters in its favour since putting down this Amendment, not only from the Newspaper Society, but from individual authors, who have written to say that whatever may be
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0237"/>
<col>465</col>
the changes affecting their copyrights abroad they desire most emphatically that the facility of registering at Stationers' Hall should be maintained. As long ago as 1842 Stationers' Hall was recognised as the centre for copyrighting, and it has been used since then and has worked exceedingly well. You can copyright at Stationers' Hall all kinds of designs; it has been used as a centre from which information can be obtained as to previous articles registered there, and has become recognised as the depot for registration. The greatest poachers of copyright in the world are the people of the United States, who, using the same language as we do, are able to take articles, books, and all kinds of copyright matter, unless precautions are taken beforehand which are costly and involve simultaneous publication, to the great detriment of authors and others. If Stationers' Hall could be recognised as the centre of registration in this country, I believe it would facilitate the matter which the Government have in view, which is the nationalisation of copyright. As a specimen of the letters I have received I will read one from a well-known author. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"As an author, and baying always registered my copyrights at Stationers' Hall, I thank you for putting down your Amendment in favour of the present system. I find by personal experience that considerable advantage and convenience exist in the simple method of registering, and the simplicity and ease with which assignments can be effected at a cost of 5<i>s.</i> There does not seem to be any adequate reason for interfering with a long-established practice to which no objection can be taken."</quote>
The Amendment is a lengthy one, but it can be summed up in the phrase that it is desirable to retain the Stationers' Hall system of registration. When you have once registered a newspaper at Stationers' Hall, all the articles which appear in the newspaper and subsequent publications become copyright, and that protects the contributor to the newspaper as well as the proprietor, and therefore the system is very conveniently arranged all round. I believe that when this subject was considered in Committee in the House of Commons the Committee came to the decision that it was inadvisable to retain Stationers' Hall in an exclusive position and that the internationalisation of copyright was desirable; but many of my friends are anxious that Stationers' Hall should be retained, and I therefore hope the noble Viscount will give the matter his serious consideration.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord spoke of the good system which used to prevail at Stationers' Hall. I cannot help thinking that he has not looked into the details of that system. I do not know any system that has been more universally condemned. To begin with, the Copyright Committee unreservedly condemned the whole system of Stationers' Hall. At Berlin, at the Convention of the great Powers, the plan of registration was also condemned, and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0238"/>
<col>467</col>
if this Amendment were accepted we should not get the benefit of the Berlin Convention. The Amendment does not even propose to make copyright essentially dependent upon registration. If that were done, there might be something to be said for the system, under which you would be able to go and look in the register and, if the register disclosed copyright in a particular work, then to abstain from printing it. But the Amendment follows the old system of Stationers' Hall. That system is one which was carefully considered in the other House and by the Government before the Bill was framed, and one of the great reforms and simplifications in the law of copyright which we have introduced is the getting rid of that system altogether. On the grounds I have stated we feel bound not to accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01558"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: As this matter formed a very important subject in the inquiry by the Copyright Committee, I should like to say a word about it. Article 4 of the Berlin Convention expressly says that&#x2014;

This matter was very fully gone into, and the Committee in their Report made this statement&#x2014;

This Amendment would require English authors and publishers to register at Stationers' Hall, but, if I appreciate the situation rightly, we could not carry out this Convention if we imposed that on foreign authors whose works come into this country. Therefore the Committee came to the conclusion that it was undesirable that there should be any system of registration. I understand that in the other House a clause of an optional character was introduced, but was finally abandoned, and I think that at the present day there is no necessity for any system of registration. This system dates back to the time when Stationers' Hall had the sole right of printing, and it followed from that that they had a right to keep up the registration.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01581">The noble Lord said: This is an Amendment which I have put down at the instance of the Publishers' Association, on whose behalf your Lordships will remember the same point was raised in Committee. There was considerable discussion then, and certain proposals were put forward. The publishers quite realise, and I think they have been wise in doing so, that any book that they publish shall be liable to be demanded by the libraries mentioned, but what they object to is that all books should be sent without any question. It will be noticed that I have excepted from my Amendment the case of the British Museum. The British Museum, of course, should have every book that is published of every sort and kind; but many books of an ephemeral nature are published in which the other libraries cannot possibly be interested, and I am told that in some cases the difficulty is to find room to sort out the mass of perfectly worthless and undigested literary matter. That being so it seems reasonable that the institutions other than the British Museum should not be in a position to ask from the publishers for a copy of every book of every sort and kind that is published. The publishers
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0240"/>
<col>471</col>
offer to supply any book that is asked for if it is demanded by the librarian, but in cases where it is not demanded they ask that they should not be put to the expense of sending a copy. I am sorry, as an Oxford man, to differ on this point from the noble Earl the Chancellor of Oxford University (Earl Curzon of Kedleston), but I hope the House will give the Amendment their consideration.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01583"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the Amendment which has just been moved is a reasonable or a feasible Amendment. I am told by those who have looked into the matter that it would be impossible to work the system if this Amendment were adopted. It should be borne in mind that this right has not been given without very valuable consideration. One would think from what has been said that this demand for copies came as a bolt from the blue, and that this privilege was asked from publishers without any right or reason. But I would point out that after the Union with Scotland, in 1709 an Act was passed giving this right to all the Scottish Universities and to the Advocates' Library, and that was the position for a considerable time. And after the Union with Ireland in 1800 the right was given in regard to Ireland to Dublin University and King's Inns Library. But the right in both cases conferred a copyright which the publishers had not previously in Scotland and Ireland.<lb/>
The matter was considered more than once, and an Act was passed in 1835 which took away, with a carefully measured compensation, from the four Scottish Universities and the King's Inns Library the right which they then had under the Act of 1709. That left the present five bodies&#x2014;the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, Oxford, the University Library, Cambridge, the Library of the Faculty of Advocates, Edinburgh, and the Library of Trinity College, Dublin&#x2014;with this privilege. Surely the history of this privilege is to be taken into account in considering the question. Everybody agrees that the British Museum should have these copies, and I am sure
<col>472</col>
my noble friend the Chancellor of the University of Oxford has made out a good case for the inclusion of the Bodleian Library. But Scotland and Ireland are in a special position. The British Museum and the libraries of the Oxford and Cambridge Universities provide for England. Is it not reasonable that Scotland, a very intellectual country, should have its library ready to hand in order that its authors and its students and its literary people may have their books collected under one roof where they may go and make their researches and pursue their studies, and so on? Is it reasonable that they should be told in Edinburgh and Glasgow and other places in Scotland, "You must go to the British Museum and forage for your books there."<lb/>
Similarly, is it not reasonable that Ireland, which has a great centre of learning and a splendid collection of books in Dublin University, should have similar facilities? Their library is open to students and all who make proper application, and they allow a user of it and every fair facility for a user of their books for reading, study, and research. Now my noble friend seeks to cut down the privilege that Ireland at present enjoys by imposing restrictions that would make it much less valuable, as I am told by those who are better judges than I am. It is conceded that the publishers do not make any complaint about the cheap books. But that is not the point. The point is that under the Amendment of my noble friend the libraries will be hit, and hit hard, with regard to the expensive books. Surely it is obvious that they will want these expensive books. What we say in Ireland is, "We may take your cheaper books and look at them at our leisure, but as to your expensive books we tell you without any hesitation at all that those are the very class of books we need for our library." Those are the very books which any great library would wish to have and that poor scholars and students cannot buy for themselves, and it is quite legitimate that they should have a public library to go to where they can examine them at their leisure.<lb/>
I have read the publishers' letters, most admirable and temperate letters, and I know some of the publishers myself, and they make little or no point about the cheap literature. Their main point is as
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0241"/>
<col>473</col>
to the expensive books. Those are exactly the books that librarians are asked for, and they would not be able to supply them. There is little more to be said. The cheap books may pass without discussion. The publishers make little point with regard to them, and even the rubbish may get an advertisement that may do some good to somebody. The object of the Amendment seems to me to mutilate or do away with a privilege which is not only highly prized but most usefully applied by these great seats of learning, and which gives a great deal of benefit to students and authors for the reason that they can indulge in research and study there. At all events they know where the books are, and if they want to examine them they can readily apply at the library.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01584"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise either to oppose or to support this Amendment. I should like, however, to make a suggestion to your Lordships. It seems to me, on reflection, that there are only four ways really of dealing with this question. One is to leave the Bill as it is; the second is to regulate the requests by the libraries, which was the subject of the Amendment that I moved the other day and which your Lordships did not accept; the third is, as I follow Lord Montagu's proposal in the next Amendment, to have an arbitration if there is an objection made by the publishers to supplying the books because they are not suitable, which it seems to me would be very inconvenient and lead to a great, deal of trouble, because one can quite understand that publishers who were very averse to supplying books might practically fight every book, so that it seems to me that it is an impracticable suggestion. But there is a fourth possibility which I venture to suggest to your Lordships, though I have not put it down as an Amendment. In fact, I should not have been in time even if I had wanted to do so, as it only occurred to me after reading this first Amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Montagu. It seems to me that what has been objected to chiefly, although, of course, no doubt the expensive books are at the bottom of it, is the demand, without any consideration by the libraries, for everything that is published, and it may be that my suggestion would be a possible way out of the difficulty. It is that it should be put upon the authorities of the library to make a written demand based upon what they consider really
<col>474</col>
needful and requisite and suitable for the library. Of course, that might put an extra duty and burden upon the librarian, but in large libraries he has assistance, and I venture to formulate this as a suggestion worthy of consideration, that the written demand which has to be made&#x2014;except in the case of the Welsh library, which is to be governed by other regulations&#x2014;should be sent direct to the publishers of the book demanding it, and the demand should contain a statement by the librarian that in his opinion the book is needful and suitable for the purposes of the library. The demand would have to be signed by him, or one of his subordinates authorised by him to do so. That would place on the librarian the duty of considering what out of the mass of publications was really required and really suitable for the purposes of the library.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01585"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to say a word about this Amendment. It seems to me, if I may say so, that by putting down this Amendment the publishers have somewhat changed their minds. As I understood the discussion to which I listened in Committee, the idea then was that it was a grievance that the publishers should have to supply the expensive books, and we had an address from the noble Lord opposite (Lord Courtney) upon the political economy of the question devoted to the particular point that, after all, the publishers were not really suffering any wrong because they got it back from the public. But now the Amendment proposes that there should be a demand made for every book, and, if I understood the mover of the Amendment rightly, he not only made no point of the expensive books but he said that as a matter of course they would be asked for and would be given. I venture to say that the proposal in the Amendment, which is all we have to deal with on this occasion, is not only unfair in principle but it would be unworkable in practice. At present, as I understand it, the four libraries mentioned, other than the British Museum, have a common agent in London who gets the books from the publishers and distributes them to the libraries. I venture to say that if you are going to put upon each individual librarian the labour and trouble and annoyance of claiming every book that is published, you will not only put an absolutely impossible amount of work upon him but you
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0242"/>
<col>475</col>
will add greatly to the difficulty and friction of carrying on the whole matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01586"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: And add to the expense of the staff.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01587"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I have no doubt; and the publishers will not get rid of the grievance of having to supply the expensive books. Something has been said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, about the University Library in Dublin. I put in a plea for the Faculty of Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. That library is, after all, a national library for Scotland; it is as national for us as the British Museum is for England and for London, It is the only really first-class library now in Scotland which is open to the general public, and particularly to students. It is quite a mistake to suppose that this is a mere professional library. It should not suffer disadvantage on account of the fact that it is maintained by the patriotism of the Faculty of Advocates. As a matter of fact, there is a small grant from public funds for the purchase of books, and on one or two occasions the Treasury have given grants for additions to the library and other matters connected with it, but almost the whole expense of the library is defrayed by the Faculty of Advocates with a liberality which does them the greatest credit and which has extended over more than 100 years. They have placed it freely and without charge at the disposal of students from all over Scotland. It would be an injustice to Scotland and to Ireland if the Scottish and Irish people had to come to the British Museum to look for these books. After all, as now put, it does not seem to me that there is any real grievance upon the publishers, because, as I mentioned a few moments ago, the idea of giving up the expensive hooks&#x2014;with which I confess I had a certain amount of sympathy, because I thought if a book was very expensive and only a limited number was published it might, perhaps, be a grievance&#x2014;has been, I understand, departed from. I do plead for the right of all these libraries to have the ordinary books that are published. They, may not keep them all, but it is in these very libraries that there is a chance of things that are published being preserved for the use of posterity, and I would express the earnest hope that this Amendment will not be agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<col>476</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01588"><member>LORD RAYLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I certainly hope that this Amendment will not be accepted by the House. I know there is great apprehension in Cambridge among those connected with the library as to the possibility of such changes taking effect. Many of the arguments have been stated with great force by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, and I need not repeat what he has said. I would be rather inclined to take the more general ground, that a change should not be made without an inquiry by a Commission or Committee or sonic such body before whom the parties interested should be fully heard. The University of Cambridge&#x2014;and I have no doubt it is true also of the other bodies interested&#x2014;have not been heard on this matter, and the objections which they have are very strong. It is natural enough that the publishers should object; one cannot be surprised at that. The publishers are men of business&#x2014;many authors think publishers are rather too much so, I believe&#x2014;but anyhow they do not undertake the publication of a book unless they can see their way to a probable profit upon it, and they take care that at any rate part of the burden should be shared both by the writers and by the readers of the books. It seems to me that it would be a step very much in the wrong direction to hamper the action of the Universities in this matter. These collections of books have a national value. It is not only a question of the interests of Oxford or Cambridge or of the Faculty of Advocates' Library in Scotland; it is a great national requirement that there should be public libraries in which all books of any kind of importance are sure to be found. Therefore I earnestly hope that the House will not interfere with the present practice, at any rate without giving much more consideration to the matter than so far has been given to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01589"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when this matter came before the House in Committee the Government took no active part in the discussion but left it to the consideration of the House, and I propose to take the same course on the present occasion. In what I say I am speaking only for myself. I cannot help feeling that we have been discussing a little wide of what is the real point of the Amendment. We are not discussing whether these libraries should be entitled to have all books which they could reasonably ask for. We
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0243"/>
<col>477</col>
are not discussing the question of putting shackles upon them in their endeavours to make a real University library. We are not seeking to limit the class of books which they obtain and which are suitable for University purposes. But do think that the speech of Lord Balfour of Burleigh has shown that we are face to face with a system which is capable of considerable abuse. The noble Lord told us that the great University libraries, instead of asking for the books they wanted, appointed a general agent in London who collected from the publishers, I suppose, all books that he found in the catalogues and sent them down. He did not tell us what was done with them. I am quite sure that these libraries do not continue to encumber their shelves with all the shilling shockers and cheap illustrated books which come within the category. But I think what the noble Lord told us and what we heard on the last occasion shows that, while this is a valuable right which the libraries possess, it is a right which is exercised without consideration for the publishers, and I confess I have more sympathy for the publishers than my noble friend behind me has, nor do I take his view of the economics of the cost of production.<lb/>
I do very strongly feel in this case that what is reasonable&#x2014;after all, one has to look to a principle&#x2014;is that these libraries should get all the books that they require and should not get the books that they do not require. I am quite aware of the difficulty of carrying out that principle by means of any legal sanction. I cannot agree with the noble Lord's proposal to send this matter to arbitration, because the cases are too numerous and too small for arbitration; but I do conceive that what is at the bottom of his Amendment is a desire to put upon the librarian of these great libraries some little sense of responsibility. Let them, by all means, have all the books that they think suitable, but do not let them appoint a general agent to sit in London and call for every book that appears in the publishers' catalogues irrespective of whether the book is really a book which is useful to the library or not. I repeat I have a great deal of sympathy for the publishers and I allow them to know something of the case, but I do not share the feelings of the noble Lord who spoke last that the libraries are likely to suffer in this respect. The librarian gets a
<col>478</col>
catalogue, the books that are likely to be of use to the University are picked out, and then they are written for. The question is how to put that in words. I do not think you can impose any legal sanction, and I do not think it is any use talking of arbitration in this connection, but I do think we should gain something if we imposed a certain amount of moral responsibility on the librarians in this respect.<lb/>
I have obtained a copy of the words which my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell suggested, and which seem to me to be better adapted to bring this forward than the words of the noble Lord opposite. I will read them to the House in order that the House may catch the sense of them, explaining again that the words do not propose to put any legal obligation or restriction on the libraries, but merely to make it necessary that the librarian should consider the value of the book before applying for it. The proposal is, after line 25&#x2014;this does not touch the Welsh case, which is dealt. with separately later&#x2014;to insert:
<quote>"A written demand, except in the case of the National Library of Wales, shall be sent direct to the publisher of the took demanded, and shall contain a statement by the librarian of the library for which the demand is made that in his opinion the book demanded is s citable and needed for the purposes of the library, and shall be signed by him or one of his subordinates authorised by him."</quote>
I confess I do not think that is imposing an undue burden upon the librarians of these University libraries, considering that they are getting the books free. I feel that it is a hardship that the publishers should not have the protection of some such principle as that, and, speaking for myself, I suggest to your Lordships that the words of my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell afford a solution of this matter which preserves all that the Universities set value on, and at the same time gives the publishers some consideration in the very difficult and expensive obligation which has been placed upon them.</membercontribution></p>

Then the noble Viscount representing the Government, speaking not for the Government but apparently as an independent member of your Lordships' House, says that he favours the words of the noble and learned Lord, but apparently does not propose them himself, and he really asks us to agree to words which nobody has proposed.

I take this line on two broad grounds. In the first place, it seems to me a most undesirable thing that on the Report stage of tins Bill there should be introduced a change vitally affecting these four great libraries of which they have had no notice. The Amendment of the noble Lord was only placed in my hands an hour or so ago; it has never been discussed in the House of Commons, and it played no part in the proceedings of that House at any stage of the Bill. Something approaching it was for the first time suggested to your Lordships' House ten days ago and was rejected by a majority of two to one, and we are now invited, in this haphazard, irregular, and almost undignified manner to accept it at the last moment.<lb/>
I venture to hope you will not look at this Amendment, and I do so for another reason, which will, perhaps, be of greater weight to those who do not share my views. It is that in practice the Amendment would not secure the objects which Lord Gorell desires. His words are that a written demand shall be sent direct to the publisher of each Look, containing a statement by the librarian of the library for which the demand is made that in his opinion the book demanded is suitable and needed for the purposes of the library, to be signed by him or one of his subordinates. Here we come to what is a fundamental misconception of the objects for which these libraries exist. The noble Viscount opposite spoke of the ease of determining what was and what was not necessary for a University library. The

whole point is that these University libraries are not merely University libraries but are national libraries; and in addition to being unwilling, as we are, to rely on the British Museum because of the difficulties, pointed out by one noble Lord, that are experienced by students in coming up to the metropolis, there is the great danger that attaches to a single national library, a danger which we all know was experienced in Paris in the year 1871 when the Biblioth&#x00E8;que Nationale was within an ace of being destroyed by fire. In consequence of these drawbacks to the existence of a single national library in this country we have always thought it desirable, and still think it desirable, to keep other national libraries in Scotland and Ireland and at the two great Universities.<lb/>
The noble Lord says, why should not the librarian make a demand for the books which in his opinion are suitable? What is the answer to that? It is that, regarding his library as a great national repository of literature, he will make a demand for every book. He cannot do anything else. How can be discriminate? The noble Lord in his Amendment seems to contemplate that the librarian is a man who has time to go through all the catalogues of books that come out, and mite out the names of those that, may appear to him to be suitable for his library. I may point out that the librarian in these cases is one of the hardest worked men in the world; he has to give assistance to students of all nationalities, and has no time to look through the names of 50,000 or 60,000 books as they come out in the course of the year. I may also point out that titles of books are most deceptive. It is almost impossible from the title of a book to judge of what it really is. There is another point that may be put. Even supposing your librarian had the time and even supposing he were a man particularly gifted with powers of discrimination, are you to trust him to judge of works which appear to him to be perhaps worthless or of little value to-day, and yet may turn out of very great value at some future date? The trash of one generation is sometimes the treasure of another, and some of the books which have now the highest value are books which were condemned and in all probability would have been rejected when published. I am sorry to say anything which might appear to cast a reflection upon the University of Cambridge, for which my
<col>482</col>
noble friend behind me has so well spoken, but it is a fact that the Cambridge University Library in the year 1818 rejected, presumably as trash, to use the words of my noble friend Lord Montagu, Beethoven's Sonata for violin, Miss Austen's "Emma," Byron's "Siege of Corinth," Shelley's "Alastor," and Scott's "Antiquary." I dare say similar mistakes were made by the Bodleian Library of that day. It shows how liable librarians are to err, and I should not like to submit any of these libraries to the risks of similar mistakes being made in the future. Is it not better, on the whole, that these libraries should retain the privileges which they have hitherto enjoyed, there really being no alternative method which you can set up?<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to believe that those who value the privilege of a University library have given full consideration to the question whether discrimination is possible. Many of us have been thinking over this matter in the last ten days, and I venture to say every one of us has come to the conclusion that, in the first place, you cannot fix on a tribunal or an arbiter, and, in the second place, even if you could, you cannot find a criterion of discrimination such as you desire or which would be of any value. The publishers have hitherto taken up the position that it is the cost to which they object; but, as Lord Balfour so pertinently pointed out, that seems to have been waived now, and the question which remains is, Are we or are we not to admit this great mass of literature? I think it ought to be brought in; it may occupy space, and storage is expensive; but some day it may be of enormous value. Anyhow it is already there, and if the British Museum were to disappear to-morrow we have the other libraries to take its place. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will adhere to the decision you came to ten days ago, and that you will not accept this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01599"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that there is nothing in my Amendment which would prevent the library agent in London acting in future for the Bodleian and other libraries exactly the same as he acts to-day. He would pick out the books which he thought important for the library and send to the publishers for them. That would be part
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0246"/>
<col>483</col>
of his duty. At the present moment he has to sit down and demand everything, and everything has to be sent to him. That I maintain is a great hardship on the publishers. As regards expense, may I repeat that by my Amendment as well as by that of Lord Gorell the libraries would, on demand, be able to get any books they chose, Therefore I think I was justified in bringing this subject forward, and I think your Lordships will recognise that the publishers have been quite reasonable and have taken up a public spirited position. Having said that, I have nothing to do but formally withdraw my Amendment, for I have no wish to put the House to the trouble of a Division the result a which I have no doubt would be against me.</membercontribution></p>

I think the clause as originally accepted was too wide. It might have given rise to the difficulties pointed out by the noble lord, Lord Courtney, with regard to lectures. The proposal now is to cut it down so as to confine it to the acquisition of manuscripts under testamentary disposition, which would give rise, I think, to fro difficulty and would make the clause inure intelligible. As it is proposed to alter it, subsection (2) would run thus&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01651">The noble Earl said: In moving this Amendment I feel to a certain extent inclined to apologise, because it is only within the last six years that any such Amendment would have been necessary. Hitherto we have trusted to the Courts of Law whenever there have been grievances between any of His Majesty's subjects that required to be settled. But there has arisen a bureaucratic system by which Courts that are not Courts of Law have a right to determine differences that may occur between one person and another. In this country we have a great many Law Courts and large sums are paid annually by the country, and justly so, for their existence, and I want to know why it is when we have all these Courts of Law in existence it should be necessary to lose the advantages for which we have paid and hand over the duties which the Courts of Law were established to perform to other people who have no legal knowledge to decide between parties. The public have not confidence in these bureaucratic Courts, because they know perfectly well that they have been appointed by politicians, and probably the appointments given to their political supporters, and I think you will all agree with me that at no time have so many awards been so lavishly bestowed upon different members of the Liberal Party. For that reason I think it is my duty to stand up and say that in a case like this, which affects so many proprietors throughout the kingdom, we should, where we have reason to object to any decision given by these sub-Courts, have the right to appeal to trained legal intellects in the Courts of Law.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01665">The noble Lord said: This Amendment is one of the very greatest; importance. It raises one of the largest and most far-reaching points of policy which your Lordships will have to discuss in this Committee.</p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0250"/>
<col>491</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01666">If your Lordships will look at the framework of the clause, which is rather complicated, you will see that in the first subsection the Bill as a whole is applied to that individual whom we know as a crofter. In the second and third subsections it is applied to those who are existing yearly tenants without leases. That I can understand. Then there is a second category called existing yearly tenants with leases. I do not understand what a yearly tenant with a lease is, but that is not the point that my Amendment raises. If your Lordships will cast your eyes clown to the proviso you will see that in these cases of yearly tenants, with or without leases as the case may be, there are two categories. The first is the case of the man who has made the improvements, or the greater part of them, at his own expense, and has not been compensated for them. So far as he is concerned, I do not raise any question of its being right and fair that he should have an independent tribunal to fix his future rent. One may think and I do think, that it is a matter of very doubtful policy on the part of the landlord to allow the tenant to make improvements of this class. It is not known and has never been contemplated in any part of Scotland with which I am personally acquainted in the management of an estate. I know it has grown up in other places, and I have no doubt, having grown up, it suits the circumstances of those districts, and I have therefore nothing to say in regard to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01667">But if your Lordships will look at paragraph (<i>b</i>)&#x2014;the one which I propose to omit&#x2014;you will see that in every other case the tenant shall not be held to be an existing yearly tenant or a qualified leaseholder within the meaning of this section, but shall, in respect of the holding, be subject to the provisions of this Bill regarding statutory small tenants. The statutory small tenants and the obligations put upon them and their landlord are found in the thirty-second clause of the Bill, and, of course, as a consequential Amendment, if my Amendment to this clause is adopted, Clause 32 will fall to the ground as being unnecessary. But I am obliged to raise the question upon this subsection because this subsection is the one which defines the class of person who is described in the Bill as the statutory small tenant. I think I have rightly described the state of matters.</p>
<col>492</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01668">Now, my Lords, the point here is that this statutory small tenant, as he is called, has <i>ex hypothesi</i> done absolutely nothing to get a permanent interest in the holding. He is a gentleman who has taken a holding for a period of years and done nothing to it except cultivate it. If he has improved it, he gets his improvements under the Agricultural Holdings Acts. But here he is to be given two things for winch he has paid nothing&#x2014;fixity of tenure, and what is called a fair and equitable rent. There has been a great deal of discussion round this question, and I have no doubt I shall I be told by the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that this is a matter on which gentlemen in the other House of Parliament have agreed to compromise. I brush that argument aside at once by saying that at any rate this House&#x2014;certainly I myself am not&#x2014;is no party to any compromise or bargain in regard to this matter. This question strikes at the very root of land tenure in Scotland. Our principle has been that the landlord does the improvements. He lets a certain holding for a period of years under the bargain that he will do the improvements. The whole interest which he gives to his tenant is that he shall cultivate it for that period of years, and at the end of that period his interest in it ceases. I have yet to learn what is the reason in fairness that this gentleman is to be given anything more than that for which he has bargained.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01669">I dislike divided tenure, what is called the dual interest of the tenant who has done the improvements. I think it bad in policy and extremely pernicious in practice, because it makes it almost impossible fairly to decide what is the respective interest of the landlord who owns the land and some of the buildings, and the tenant who does not own any of the land but has put up some part of the buildings. If the landlord has bona fide done the whole of his duty, why is this dual interest to be created? What is the reason in sense or justice or fairness for bringing it in? I understand it in the case of the crofter. It was arrived at after a lasting inquiry, and it was found that there was not only a hereditary interest on the part of many of them in the land which they cultivated, but there was also the practical question that they had, as a fact, put up improvements. I say at once if the tenant has put up improvements the necessity of the case and the fairness of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0251"/>
<col>493</col>
the case is that his interests should be judged, but I have never yet heard of any reason for bringing in this dual interest where the landlord has clone everything in his power to improve and the tenant nothing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01670">I believe this proposal in the Bill to be absolutely ruinous, and I go so far as to say that any one who advocates it must be animated by some sort of insanity or ill-feeling towards the landlord. I can conceive of no other reason for making this departure in practice. It is the beginning of all the evils which will come upon us through dual interest as has been the case in Ireland and elsewhere. This is a revival of the original proposal to crofterise the whole of Scotland. Here is a case in which the landlord has done everything to preserve his interest, and yet by a stroke of the pen you are going to give the tenant two things for which he has paid nothing. I have asked for the reason why this is to be done, but at present no reason has been given. I may be told that there is a certain demand for it or that it is being done for some other reason, but this has not been preceded by any inquiry. Before you passed the Irish Land Act and the Crofters Act there was an inquiry, but in this case there has been no sort of collected evidence and no judicial inquiry by any impartial tribunal, yet you are asked to make this enormous and far-reaching change in the existing agricultural system of Scotland. I will not elaborate my argument further, but will simply wait to see whether on the ground of fairness and reason any case can be advanced for making this enormous change.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01672"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord who has just spoken has, of course, no doubt in his own mind that this Amendment strikes at the very root of this measure. He informed your Lordships that Clause 32, to which the proviso which the noble Lord is attacking refers, was introduced into the Bill this year as a result of conference, consultation, and agreement between both sides in the House of Commons. Before referring to that in detail, I should like to remind your Lordships of the case for this change. It is really identical with the case for the whole Bill. It rests upon
<col>494</col>
the admitted necessity, on national as well as on agricultural grounds, for doing something in Scotland to strengthen and develop the system of small holdings. The noble Lord said there had been no judicial inquiry. There was a Small Holdings Inquiry only a few years ago. There was another in the year 1883 by a Committee of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01673"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: On Scotland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01674"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think it took evidence in Scotland. It was previous to the introduction by the noble Lord's own Government in the year 1895 of a Small Holdings Act which is now the law, and which has never done any good whatever to Scotland. But those inquiries revealed what I believe is the admitted fact, that while 5ear large towns there may Le some slight increase of small holdings, there his been on the whole a decrease of small holdings all over the country. Small Holdings are gradually being absorbed. Under the present conditions of their tenure and their circumstances they are not a paying form of property. That is part of my case. They are not paying to the tenant and they are not paying to the landlord, and. the consequence is that time after time these small holdings are absorbed and thrown into large farms. But, my Lords, this is the only civilised agricultural country in Europe in which small holdings are not a paying form of property, and the radical and vital difference between the system of small holdings in Scotland and in those countries to which I have alluded is that in Scotland the small holdings are not upon a basis of security of tenure.<lb/>
I ask your Lordships' pardon for going into what is a Second Reading matter, but it was raised by the noble Lord. I say again that it is the common experience throughout Europe that it is only upon a basis of security of tenure and by grouping your small holdings so that they have economical marketing and purchasing of produce that you can hope to develop agricultural organisation, co-operation, and common effort which make small holdings in other countries successful. We are going to set to work, if your Lordships will allow us, in Scotland to do, not everything, but a little towards remedying this
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0252"/>
<col>495</col>
great evil, and surely the first thing we ought to do, before we create new holdings, is to strengthen the economic position of the existing holdings&#x2014;holdings which are the subject of agreement between landlord and tenant, holdings which have survived the economic decay which has absorbed other small holdings. Surely these form the <i>nuclei</i> round which this effort should Concentrate itself. We should do something for the existing small holder. What are we to do? These small holdings are not, of course, crofter holdings; they are outside the Crofters Act, but they form the vast majority of small holdings in Scotland, because, as I mentioned to your Lordships on Second Reading, landlords everywhere where they could afford it have done the improvements; so that if your Lordships cut out these holdings from the operation of the Bill you will leave almost no holdings in the Bill. That measures the effect of the noble Lord's Amendment, and it also measures the extent of the concession which the supporters of the Bill in its original form have made to the Opposition in another place. We have removed these holders from the category of crofters, or landholders as they are now called under this Bill, and we have applied to these statutory small tenants, as they are called under the Bill, the code of Clause 32.<lb/>
Will your Lordships be good enough, as it is vital to this discussion, to turn to Clause 32. There you will see exactly what has been the arrangement come to. I carefully guarded myself on Second Reading from any implication that in this matter there was an agreement which should hind your Lordships' House. But we at any rate ought to be cognisant of what took place in another place. This clause is the result of conference and discussion there. What does it do? It gives to these existing tenants, tenants who are in their farms by the choice and sanction of the landlord, the right when they come to the end of their lease to a fair rent and to a renewal of their lease. They are to remain under the Agricultural Holdings Act. The landlord is to continue, if he so chooses, to do all improvements. They are not to increase&#x2014;what the noble Lord objects to&#x2014;their interest in the holding, but they are to remain there, awl if any difficulty or difference should arise between them and their landlord there is the Land Court to appeal to, and
<col>496</col>
the Land Court is bound to act within the limits of this Clause 32.<lb/>
With regard to the equitable rent, there is no ground for thinking that there will be any great difference between the opinion of the Land Court and the opinion of a good landlord; and so far as continuity of tenure and the renewal of the lease is concerned, I should have thought that this was the very minimum of security of tenure that you could give to these tenants. Depend upon it this is the very minimum you can give if you are going to encourage these men to put their whole energy into their work and if you are going to put them upon a footing so that they can co-operate and organise with their neighbours and make these small holdings a success. I would repeat to the noble Lord that the justification is the national interest. If you do not have regard to this question of depopulation you will feel it in many different directions in your national life apart altogether from agriculture, and there is no safer or surer or wiser way to increase your country population than to offer to men who labour and live on the land the opportunity of making a secure home and a livelihood in the calling to which they have devoted their lives.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01675"><member>THE MARQUESS OF HUNTLY</member><membercontribution>: I do
not think the noble Lord has given full attention to the objections raised by my noble friend in moving his Amendment. Although I admit that Clause 32, which we are discussing along with this Amendment, was the result of what is called a conference between the different sides in the House of Commons, I do not think that the full extent to which it affects the tenants on the East and North-east of Scotland was fully realised by those who entered into the conference. In the district which I come from in Scotland, all the tenants who are affected by this subsection and by Clause 32 sit under agreements in writing. There is hardly a case, I believe, in which a tenant sits from year to year without an agreement in writing with his landlord.<lb/>
The effect of this proposal in the Bill is that the tenant who is at the end of his lease or agreement and wishes to continue in his holding, can, if he does not agree with his landlord, go to the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0253"/>
<col>497</col>
Land Court and ask them to fix what is called an equitable rent. Then, as I read the clause as it stands, the Land Court may deal with this question, and may look at the holding under the very elaborate proposal in subsection. (8) of Clause 32; they may look into all these questions, and may decide what improvements have been mule respectively by the landlord and by the tenant, in what condition they are, and they may fix the rent to be paid in the future. Now that appears to me distinctly to be setting up a body which may go behind and beyond the written terms of the agreement between the landlord and tenant. You have two people coming to an agreement&#x2014;that is universal in my part of Scotland&#x2014;and you allow that agreement to be overridden in dealing with the tenancy in the future. If it was clearly laid down in Clause 32 that not only might the landlord and tenant, as it is said in subsection (6), make an agreement as to the conditions of the renewed tenancy, but that the past agreement dealing with any question connected with the tenancy should be held binding upon both parties, I should be rather agreeable to let the clause pass, especially if an Amendment which stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Clinton, asking that the arbiter under the Agricultural Holdings Act be substituted for the Land Court, is accepted.<lb/>
I admit that there have been hopes held out under this proposal in Scotland, and that it would be hard to omit entirely to deal with these tenancies. But I quite agree with my noble friend who moved this Amendment that there is certainly room for improving the position of matters under Clause 32. I would suggest that this subsection should be postponed, and that when we get to the details of Clause 32 we should then deal with it and see whether we can put the clause into a shape which would be agreeable to all of us. If that could be done it would be better, as it is rather difficult now to discuss the most important principles contained in this clause upon a subsection which deals in this way with the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01676"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Lord will not press his Amendment to a Division. I do not wish for a moment to speak about the justice of Lord Balfour's statement of the case, because I think the justice is entirely on his side. A landlord who has come to an agreement
<col>498</col>
with his tenant and has erected the whole of the buildings molt in common fairness to have the right to fix the rent. But I would point out to the noble Lord, speaking, as I think I can speak, with a certain amount of experience upon this matter as I live in a crofter county, that in my opinion he will find that the danger of this clause is nothing nearly as great as many noble Lords think. In the case where the landlord does the improvements the average tenant in Scotland will not be such a fool as to go to the Land Court, because, although he might leave his rent reduced by a sovereign, he knows he would be faced with the certainty that when he wanted a new barn or other improvement the landlord would Hot do it for him.<lb/>
I have some 400 or so of these small holders, and a certain number of them immediately after the Act was passed elected to go under the Crofters Act. I certainly do not pretend to be a beneficent landlord because I am a poor landlord, and poor and beneficent are not terms which usually go together. From the mere fact that my other tenants know that they have an average chance of getting help in the construction of their holdings, not one of them wishes to go under the Act, and many of the tenants who did go under the Act now wish they could come out of it. And if you go to the southern parts where estates are richer and where more is done for the tenants, I think you will find that at first there will be a certain number of applications from individuals to get a fair rent fixed, but after the first rush is over these unfortunate individuals who will, so to speak have been taken in by the measure of His Majesty's Government will find that they will not have that same freedom or, rather, the landlord will not be so willing to do the improvements for them, as was the case in the past. The landlord will take up the logical position, "You have a fair rent fixed, and why should I do any more for you? Go and ask the Land Court for any improvements that you want." I do not for a moment dispute the justice of Lord Balfour's contention, but I do not believe, once the small holders realise that they gravely imperil the chance of the landlord doing anything more to help them, that many of them will take advantage of this clause. For that reason I trust that the noble Lord will not press his Amendment to a Division.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01677"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I am inclined to second the proposal which was made just now by the noble Marquess, Lord Huntly, that your Lordships should not arrive at a decision on this point, which is really a point almost vital to the Bill, at this particular stage. If your Lordships were not to arrive at a decision until you had discussed Clause 32, it. would be possible if you saw fit afterwards, when you came to Report, to accept Lord Balfour's Amendment, which would really become a consequential one. That is a matter, of course, for the noble Lord himself to consider. The Secretary for Scotland said that there was a certain amount of consultation and agreement with regard to Clause 32 in the other House. Throughout the whole process of this Bill there has been no real agreement in the other House, because if your Lordships will refer to the proceedings which took place in Grand Committee and in the House itself on Report, you will find that the Unionist Members moved Amendment after Amendment and made proposal after proposal nearly every one of which was rejected. The difficulty in that House was that they were only about eleven or twelve in number, and they met the usual late which is encountered by a minority. But, my Lords, I certainly was surprised to hear the noble Lord put forward as part of his argument that small tenancies do not pay either the tenants or the landlords, and it struck me as very strange that in that case the noble Lord proposes to increase them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01678"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I cannot have made my point clear to the noble Lord. What I meant to convey was that under present conditions these small tenancies were not profitable, and that was one of the reasons which induced the Government to endeavour to alter the conditions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01679"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I quite accept that alteration; but at the same time the words "under present conditions" were not used by the noble Lord, and it seemed to me rather a strange argument.. After saying that small tenancies pay neither the tenants nor the landlords he asked, "Why is it?" and he said that it was owing to insecurity of tenure. What ground has the noble Lord for making an assertion like that? It is contrary to all
<col>500</col>
my experience, and I believe it is contrary to the experience of every noble Lord here connected with Scotland. I can say this, that for nearly fifty years now I do not think I ever got rid of a small tenant, and I believe other noble Lords can say the same. I do not know whether my tenants have leases or not, but all I can say is that not one of them has ever put forward any complaint on that ground; and as to security of tenure, I can only say that the tenants&#x2014;my tenants are, and I believe everybody else's, for I am not in the least better than other people&#x2014;are just as secure as their landlords. If the noble Lord will produce any instances or any proof whatsoever in support of his assertion that the reason why small tenancies do not pay is that the tenants are insecure, then he will
do a thing that he has never done up to the present time.<lb/>
What has the noble Lord's argument always been when we have asked him for facts? He has said, "I know better than facts." The noble Lord shakes his head, but I think if I were to go into the other room I could produce proof of it from the reports because I have heard him say so. What has been his argument? He says that the people who know are the Members of Parliament for Scotland. He appeals to the representatives of the electors for facts with regard to agriculture. I do not want to say a single word of disrespect to any Member of Parliament for Scotland further than this, that a good many of them are Englishmen; and as for the knowledge which they possess, or any attention they have given to the subject of agriculture in Scotland&#x2014;well, I will not say anything more about it. Then the noble Lord says we must do something for the existing small holders. I think he will find when this Bill comes to be worked that very few of the existing small holders will appear before your Land Court. That is my present conviction. But to say that there is no ground for assuming that the view of the Land Court will be different with regard to rent from that of a good landlord&#2014;well that is a question I should be much more ready to answer if I knew who is going to be the Chairman of this Land Court and who are to be the persons who will compose it.<lb/>
Let me point out this, that whether your Lordships accept Clause 32 or whether
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0255"/>
<col>501</col>
you do not, the proposals in this Bill are, I am afraid&#x2014;and I have some reason to believe it&#x2014;a death-blow to the application of capital to land in Scotland, and particularly to small holdings. Do you suppose that in future any prudent man will lay out money on a small holding? I have done it myself&#x2014;I have been foolish enough&#x2014;and other noble Lords have done the same. I quite agree with the noble Lord; it certainly does not pay me&#x2014;not in one way, yet, it, does in another, because I have always endeavoured to be on the best of terms with my neighbours of all kinds. But now all this is to be placed under the Land Court, and the taxpayer is to pay for this in future; he is to make up the difference between a holding that pays and a holding that does not pay.<lb/>
I do not think any one can in logic or having regard to facts argue against what Lord Balfour of Burleigh said. I believe Celt everything he said is quite true, but I do not go so far with hint as to advise year Lordships to strike out Clause 32. is will tell you my reason in a very few words. Under Clause 32, at all events, all questions of compensation have to be determined under the Agricultural Holdings Acts. Lord Clinton, in a subsequent Amendment which we shall conic to on Clause 32&#x2014;and this is one of the reasons
why I hope your Lordships will not come to a conclusion on this question just at this moment&#x2014;proposes that rent should be fixed according to the terms of the Agricultural Holdings Acts with regard to these existing tenants. I think that is any great improvement. I cannot see any reason, when you are putting existing tenants under the Agricultural. Holdings Acts for everything else except rent, why you should bring in this Land Court. at all. Existing tenants are under the Agricultural Holdings Acts for compensation and other matters. Then why not put them under those Acts for rent and so make the thing complete? if that is adopted I hope your lordships will accept Clause 32&#x2013;1 do not mean to say that I think it a perfect clause, because I do not at all. If I had been asked to suggest the way in which the noble Lord should have drawn his Bill. I would have said, "Have two sets of tenancies &#x2014;one set the new holdings and holdings which are under the Bill, and the other set the existing holdings and all future voluntary holdings which shall
<col>502</col>
not be under the Bill." if would have said, "Make as many holdings as you like under your Bill; take the land, erect the buildings, do what you like with regard to new holdings; but, with regard to existing holdings, leave things as they are, if you do not want to do away with the good feeling winch exists between landlords and tenants and if you do not wish to divert to the Land Court capital which was applied notoriously under conditions that the whole tenure was voluntary both as regards landlords and tenants." That is what I should have done. I do not claim to be an authority on these matters, but that is the way I should have drawn the Bill if I had had to draw it.<lb/>
Now with regard to Clause 32. The reason why I should not be in favour of striking it. out is this, that with the suggested Amendment Clause 32 will be all under the Agricultural Holdings Acts, whereas if you strike out Clause 32 you then fall under the Crofters Acts. To apply the Crofters Acts to the existing holdings in the Lowlands of Scotland would be an atrocious act of spoliation, because a crofter can do anything he likes; he can erect any sort of building he chooses, and it is then in his power to claim and to get compensation from the landowner who has not been consulted in the matter at all. Under Clause 32, however, he must be consulted with regard to a building. I think I have explained to your Lordships why Clause 32, although I do not approve of it, is less bad, in my opinion, than the ordinary proposals of the Bill, and therefore I cannot support. Lord Balfour of Burleigh, at all events at this stage, in striking the clause out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01680"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I think it is quite clear that on this side of the House we entirely agree with the arguments which my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh has used in proposing his Amendment, in that we can see no reason for placing these tenants under the Bill at all. They are in an entirely different position from the other tenants dealt with and from those who have hitherto come under the provisions of the Crofters Acts. They have no interest in their holdings save that of occupation, the whole of the improvements, buildings, and other: pings being entirely the property of the landlord. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland gave us
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0256"/>
<col>503</col>
his reasons for bringing them under the Bill, largely, I think he said, on the ground of national, social, and agricultural reasons, or some words to that effect. I can quite imagine an enthusiast for small holdings having many reasons of a national and social character, but I do not understand what social and agricultural reasons there can be for bringing them under this Bill. Does the noble Lord think that by turning large farms into a large number of small ones we shall increase the standard of agriculture and see a higher quality of stock kept, or a greater production from the soil? I do not believe that in any one of those particulars there can be any agricultural advantage in bringing these particular statutory tenants under the measure.<lb/>
The noble Lord also told us that there has been a decrease in small holdings in Scotland. I have no doubt he has figures to show that, otherwise he would not have said so. But it is news to many of us that these small holdings have decreased. They certainly have not decreased in the part of Scotland with which I am acquainted, and there are a very large number there. The noble Lord gave as his reason that they were not paying either the landlord or the tenant. That may be true. But, how does he propose to make them pay? By putting them under Clause 32. The only reason that is given as to why they can be made to pay under that clause is security of tenure. I agree that these tenants should have as much security of tenure as possible. If they have not fixed rents at the present moment they have at all events full security of tenure, so that the only way the holdings can be made to pay is by a reduction of rent. The noble Lord has told us that in his opinion there will not be much difference as to a fair rent between the Land Court and a good landlord. We all claim to be good landlords; but if there is no difference of opinion between them, then the rental will remain the same. Therefore there can be no reason for thinking that because of the matter going before the Land Court these small holdings can be made to pay more than they do at present. I recognise that this part of the scheme is a portion of the framework which we accepted on Second Heading, and although I thoroughly agree with Lord Balfour's reasons for moving his Amendment I regret I am unable to support it.</membercontribution></p>
<col>504</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01681"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I think this discussion has shown that the House is in a rather curious position. Lord Pentland dealt with the economic difficulties of small holders. I admit them. I agree that there are difficulties in their case from economic causes which are too strong for them. But how is this Bill going to help them? This Bill will not change the economic difficulties under which they exist; they will remain exactly the same, except. that I agree with one noble Lord who said that there will be a great deal more hesitation on the part of landlords now to put money into small holdings. I know, as far as I am concerned, that no power on earth would induce me to spend another penny on a small holding if this Bill passes and I am to be at the mercy of the Land Court.<lb/>
Just look at the precedent we are creating. Lord Camperdown admits that what I suggest is logic, Lord Lovat said that what I suggest is just, and Lord Clinton, I understand, agrees with me, but for some curious reason those noble Lords are not going to support me on a Division. We are departing, in the case of Lowland holdings, from the one principle which has regulated that class of holding both in England and Scotland up to this time, that where the landlord does the improvements and does his duty he has a right to choose his tenants. It is all very well to talk of this being a case of small holdings, of their economic difficulties, and of the importance of small holdings to the nation at large. But you are making a precedent which does not stop at small holdings. The Lord Advocate in the other House gave that part of the case away, because he said there is no magic in the 50 acres, and that the moment it is wanted it would go over the whole of agriculture. The House is making a precedent which in the future will be held up against it as applicable to other holdings in Scotland and England, whether the landlord has done the improvements or not. Make no mistake about that, and do not say that you were not warned. I hope I am a reasonable person, but I am wholly unconvinced by the speeches that have been made. If possible I am strengthened in the view I hold, but I shall not put the House to the trouble of a Division on this particular subsection. I will wait until I see what form Clause 32 ultimately takes. But no power on earth will make me a consenting party to the

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01698"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: This Amendment deals with a much smaller matter. Subsection (2) of this clause says that the gentleman who is to be the head of the Land Court "shall forthwith on his appointment have the same rank as if he had been appointed a Judge of the Court of Session."

The words I do not say give an exact precedent, but it is the nearest precedent we can find. The words in the Irish Land Act are&#x2014;
<quote>" The Judicial Commissioner for the time being shall forthwith on his appointment become an additional Judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Ireland, with the same rank, salary, tenure of office, and right to pension."</quote>
The noble Lord, I think, knows that later on in this same clause there is a further reference to this Judge with reference to his pension. It is in the latter half of subsection (9). I do not know whether the noble Lord objects to the form in which the matter is introduced, or to the introduction of any such reference at all.</membercontribution></p>

You are not giving him the position of a Judge and you are not giving him the salary of a Judge. The clause which the noble Lord read from the Irish Land Act gives the Commissioner in that case the same tenure and salary as a Judge. In this case you are giving this gentleman who is to have what is called the rank of a Judge &#x00A3;2,000 a year. That is not the salary of a Scottish Judge. You are not going to give hint the tenure of a Judge, because he is to be

removable in the event either of inability or misbehaviour at the instance of the Secretary for Scotland. I would like to ask the noble Lord, should this gentleman play golf on Sunday, which is not looked upon With favour in certain parts of Scotland, whether that would be misbehaviour within the definition of misbehaviour in the Bill? Then, again, it is said he is to have the same rank as a Judge. Is he to be called Lord So-and-so, and is his wife to be called Lady So-and-so, and what is to happen in that case if by inability or misbehaviour he is removed? You will not give him the ability of a Judge because you give him the rank of a Judge, neither will you give him the experience and the judicial attributes of a Judge because you nominally give him the rank. I myself think it is an absurdity, and I move to omit the words "and shall forthwith on his appointment have the same rank as if lie had been appointed a Judge of the Court of Session."</membercontribution></p>

am advised that these words, which are general words and which, as the noble Lord himself will admit, would cover very varied qualifications, are really better omitted. They would, moreover, leave some doubt as to what qualifications the fourth or the fifth member should have. If the noble Lord will be good enough to be content at this stage with the assurance I have given, it will not deprive him of the power to move an Amendment at a later stage.

It does seem to me to be a remarkable thing that, being about to constitute so important a Court as this the chairman of which is to be considered to be in rank equal to that of a judge of the Court of Session, the names of those persons should never have been given to the House of Commons nor to your Lordships' House. Considering that a good deal of the feeling with regard to this Bill does depend upon the view that may be taken of the persons who will administer it, their qualifications and their fairness, would it not be better from the point of view of the Government themselves that the names of the members of the Land Court should be given before we proceed much further with the Bill?</membercontribution></p>

I hope at a later stage to be able to announce the name of the proposed chairman of the Land Court, but in regard to the remaining four members of the Court I can do no more than indicate
<col>510</col>
the lines upon which the Government would wish to proceed in making their selection. They would all be men having the qualifications which the noble Lord (Lord Saltoun) mentions in his Amendment. They would all be men knowing agricultural affairs in Scotland, and in their whole number embracing, so far as it is possible, knowledge of the whole of Scotland. There are four of them, and I hope it would be possible for the Government to obtain through them a representation on the Land Court of knowledge of all parts of Scotland. Let me say that political considerations should, of course, be subordinate in the selection of men for such offices as this. The endeavour of the Government will be at any cost to select the best possible men that can be procured to discharge these duties at the salaries which are offered to them in the Bill. I think so far as political opinions may be known no political Party should be at a disadvantage, shall I say, in the selection of these four gentlemen. I do not know if I can give the noble Viscount and the House any further information. I can assure him that it is the desire of the Government to do everything to satisfy any reasonable apprehensions in regard to this Court. Their desire is that public opinion should ratify anything that they may do in regard to it.</membercontribution></p>

Before he does that, I only wish to say this, that on the impartiality of the chairman and on his judicial qualities depends, I believe, to a very large extent the success of the operation of this Bill. If a lawyer is appointed who has not associated himself prominently either with one side or the other, who is well known at the Bar, and who is well known to be an impartial person, I believe it would give the greatest satisfaction in Scotland.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01716"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a word in support of the proposition of my noble friend behind me. The appointment of the chairman of this Land Court is really a matter of supreme importance, both for the information of your Lordships and for the amicable passage of the Bill through this House. I would therefore earnestly press upon the noble Lord that we shall have the name of the chairman of the Court before we take the Report stage of this Bill. As regards the other members of the Court I would not apply such strong pressure, but we credit the noble Lord with having every desire in the appointment of these gentlemen to translate the principle he has referred to into practice. He said, however, in response to my noble friend, "We may find a certain difficulty in meeting your views with regard to this, because of the attitude which your Lordships have exhibited; your treatment of the measure so far has rendered it doubtful whether we shall be able to pursue our intentions." If the noble Lord was referring to our procedure here, I cannot imagine anything more remote from the facts. Your Lordships have only been engaged on this Bill for about three-quarters of an hour. We had a very serious discussion on my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh's Amendment, and Lord Balfour ultimately withdrew it, or, at all events, did not carry it to a Division. The only other Amendment we have carried was one of very subordinate importance upon which the noble Lord, Lord Pentland, did not choose to divide the House. Therefore he has really no right to turn round at this stage and say anything derogatory with regard to the procedure of noble Lords on this side of the House with regard to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<col>512</col>
of the Bill and also a remembrance of the Amendments on the Paper. With regard to the confidence the noble Earl invites, I have already said that I hope to be able to give the name of the chairman of the Land Court on the Report stage. I make my acknowledgments to him for what he said with regard to the other four members of the Court. The constitution of this Land Court is really a matter of great difficulty and responsibility, and I wish I had been in a position earlier to take more active steps in regard to the matter. I cannot, therefore, hold out a hope to noble Lords that I shall be able to give them until later the names of the four members to complete the Court.</membercontribution></p>

Yet Mr. Gladstone on that occasion judged that it would be altogether unfair to the House of Commons and also to your Lordships' House that we should be asked blindfold to commit all these properties to the jurisdiction of a man whose name we were not allowed to hear.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01746"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> moved to substitute the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for the Secretary for Scotland at the commencement of the clause. The noble Lord said: The Amendment which I am now about to move I think I may say claims at least equal importance with that of any other Amendment which is down upon the Paper. I regret that two Amendments of my own of such vital importance should come so close together, because nothing is further from my inclination than to monopolise the time of the Committee. But, my Lords, I am of opinion that this separation of agricultural interests into two parts, Scottish and English, is in the highest degree detrimental to the interests of agriculture as a whole upon both sides of the Border. I say primarily and essentially it is contrary to the best interests of Scottish agriculture. English agriculture has a large power and great influence behind it, and can to a certain extent stand by itself, but if you transfer the interests of Scottish agriculture to a mere sub-department of the Scottish Office you will do, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest injuries which it is possible to do to the interests of Scottish agriculture.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01747">Scottish agriculture has but little political power behind it. There is hardly a county in Scotland in which the agricultural voter is in a majority. As a matter of fact there are only two, and I count in that the vote of every landlord, every tenant, and every farm labourer; and yet if you do that, there are only two counties in Scotland in which the agricultural interest pure and simple has anything approaching to a majority of the electorate. That being so, agriculture in Scotland can, I am sorry to say, bring but little influence to bear upon the administration supposed to be conducted in its interests if it is separated from the Board of Agriculture in London. Agriculturists in England have many interests in common. They have an interest in the good cultivation of the soil; they have interests in statistics; they have interests in getting information up to date; and they have interests, contrary to other ratepayers, for which they sorely need an advocate with a seat in the Cabinet. There is nothing especially Scottish in the interests of Scottish agriculture in the Lowlands. I frankly admit that when you go to the Highlands and to the crofting counties there it is a purely Scottish
<col>516</col>
matter and must be dealt with in the future as in the past by the Scottish Office. But if there is one point in the whole round of their interests on which Scottish agriculturists in the Lowlands are unanimous, it is that they will have nothing to do with the Scottish Office in comparison to the Board of Agriculture. They may be right or they may be wrong. In my opinion they are right, for the reasons which I have partly given and for others which I shall proceed to give; but at any rate make no mistake about it, that is their opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01748">Convene a representative body of agriculturists where you like, under what circumstances you please, and I defy you to get a resolution in support of the provisions of this Bill. At Perth there was a resolution passed and an amendment moved. Neither the resolution nor the amendment had any support for the proposals of this Bill. I am not going to quote the resolution again because it was quoted on the Second Reading, but there were two remarkable statements made in the speeches delivered on that occasion. The mover of the resolution, expressing strong disapproval of a Board of Agriculture for Scotland under the Scottish Office, said that in sixteen years there had been many discussions on Scottish agriculture, yet in all these debates covering that long period he had not come across a single speech which definitely acknowledged that the interests of Scottish agriculture would be better administered under the Scottish Office than under the Board of Agriculture. He said that he could not find a single speech by a Scottish agriculturist, and he had searched all the records, advocating that Scottish agriculture should be put under the Scottish Office. Later on I find this statement in the speech of Mr. Douglas, one of the vice-presidents. He said that the Bill as it stood was without a friend in the world&#x2014;a Bill which it was said had the unanimous verdict of Scotland at two elections, and yet at that large assembly of Scottish farmers not one man had risen to give it whole-hearted support.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01749">I say, after those statements which cannot be controverted, I stand here with a right to speak for Scottish agriculture whatever the instincts of Scottish Home Rulers may be; and if we are put under the Scottish Office the fear of Scottish agriculturists is this, that the interests of crofters and small holders will be thought
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0263"/>
<col>517</col>
to be much more important than all the interests of those who cultivate the large farms and the broad acres of Scotland. I do not at this moment touch on the administration of the Contagious Diseases Acts, because there are various Amendments coming afterwards with regard to that matter, some in the name of the Secretary for Scotland himself and some in the names of other noble Lords. Of course as an illustration it would be useful to show how very evil the results of this policy would be, but as I even now hope that that matter will be given up I am not going to argue it at length. I say, however, that the mere danger of the separation of the administration of the Contagious Diseases Acts in England and Scotland into two different authorities has caused an absolute panic amongst agriculturists on both sides of the Border. The noble Lord opposite shakes his head, but I defy him to get a resolution from any body of agriculturists either in England or in Scotland in favour of that proposal. Not one has been produced as yet, and I do not believe he can get one. I do not know where the proposal came from or who started it. I have not seen a single argument in favour of it which is worthy of a moment's consideration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01750">I pass from that because I am on the general question, and to me it is a matter of the greatest importance for the administration of agricultural interests that those who have to administer it should have a real knowledge of agricultural wants and of agricultural needs, and it would be a distinct disadvantage to the agriculturists of Scotland to be separated in this matter from their English brethren. There are more than the proverbial three courses open to us in regard to this proposal. The first, which I sincerely hope this House will adopt, is to keep the administration of agriculture as it is under the Board in London, with or without special Commissioners. The second course is to nationalise it, as it is called, but to keep it to the Board of Agriculture. That, in my opinion, is a less satisfactory method than the former one, but it is not so unsatisfactory as either of the other two. There is another idea to have a special Minister for Scottish Agriculture with a special Department and a seat in Parliament. I do not think that the interests of Scotland in agriculture are sufficiently large for that course to be taken. It
<col>518</col>
might be satisfactory if they were large enough; but I look with some suspicion upon the multiplication of this class of office, because you could not hope that the Minister's office would be of sufficient importance to give him a seat in the Cabinet, and unless in these days the Minister who is responsible for agriculture has a seat in the Cabinet he is severely handicapped in carrying out his duties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01751">The fourth proposal is that the transfer should take place as proposed in the Bill. I venture to say that, while some friends may be found in Scotland for any one of the other three courses, you will not find a single individual who has a right to speak for agriculturists to support the proposal in the Bill. Therefore my suggestion is&#x2014;the Amendments look elaborate, but they will stand or fall together&#x2014;that there should be, if you choose, certain Commissioners of Agriculture specially appointed under the Board of Agriculture to look after Scottish interests. Of course it requires a certain manipulation of the framework of the Bill, because the Bill has been cast from the beginning with the idea of the transference of the whole of agriculture&#x2014;crofting, congested districts, and everything else&#x2014;to the Scottish Office. I do not propose in this Amendment to change the transfer from the Crofter Commission to the Land Court. It is quite right, if you are going to have a Land Court at all, that it should absorb the Crofter Commission&#x2014;that I think is reasonable. Nor do I propose for a moment that the administration of the Congested Districts Board should be done from London. That is a purely Scottish matter. It has been arranged heretofore entirely under the Scottish Office, and I venture to think if there were more frequent meetings of the Congested Districts Board it would be a much more satisfactory administration than it is at the present time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01752">The proposal that I make is, while not interfering with the Crofter Commission being transferred to the Land Court, that the Congested Districts Board should remain practically as it is responsible to the Scottish Office, and that the remaining&#x2014;which, after all, is by far the most important&#x2014;part of agriculture in Scotland should remain with its responsibility to the Board of Agriculture in London and its interests looked after in common with
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0264"/>
<col>519</col>
the other agriculturists of the whole country. I do not know that I need say more upon the subject, because it seems to me that at present we have not had any real reason given us why Scottish agriculture is to be separated from the English side of the question, and I should be constantly afraid, if you once set up a separate Department, that there would be continual efforts to get hold of the administration of things which ought to be administered in common. I am very loath to have taken up so much of the time of the House. I think I have made my point clear, and I shall be guided by the course the debate takes as to whether I shall press the Amendment to a Division or not.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01754"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has brought forward a proposal which, of course, goes to the very root of this Bill, and which I had to say on Second Reading was vital to the Bill. The noble Lord assumes that this scheme has been brought forward, not in the interests of Scottish agriculture, but from some notion as to Home Rule. I can assure the noble Lord that the sole consideration which has animated the Government in making this proposal has been how to get the best possible administration of agricultural business for Scotland. I do not wish to controvert what the noble Lord has said. He knows of his own knowledge with regard to agricultural opinion in Scotland that it is quite undeniable that there has been for many years continuous and constant dissatisfaction with the administration of agricultural business in Scotland. There is evidence of that to be found in the proceedings which are published annually of the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture, of which, if I mistake not, the noble Lord is honorary president&#x2014;at least, if he is not now he was until quite recently.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01755"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Until last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01756"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will find in the records of that body continual dissatisfaction expressed at the administration of agricultural business in Scotland, and, as I said on Second Reading,
<col>520</col>
that is not due&#x2014;far be it from me to imply it or to say it&#x2014;to any defect in the work done by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. It is due to remoteness, to want of familiarity with the conditions, which always characterises administration carried on in Scotland from London. The best proof of what I have said is to be found in the proceedings at Perth, to which the noble Lord referred. Everybody sought for a remedy, and while it was not the case that the proposal which is in this Bill was put forward, it is the case that everybody wanted some change; and I submit that if that is the case and the true condition of opinion the proposals of the Government, which have not varied for four or live years in this matter, are at least deserving of some consideration.<lb/>
As the noble Lord said, the main, if not the sole, reason for the opposition of the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture to this change has been the question of the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act. I shall say what I have to say on that point when my noble friend's Amendment comes before the House, and I shall follow the noble Lord in not dwelling upon that point now. But what I have said as to dissatisfaction applies to the present work carried on in Scotland by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. What is the remedy? The remedy which the noble Lord proposes is that there should be a strengthening of the stall of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in Scotland, that there should be a sub-department located in Scotland to deal with the Scottish business. That system would work in exactly the same way as the present system does. The supreme authority would be in London; reference would have to be made to London, and the same predominant interests&#x2014;English opinion and English interests&#x2014;would sway the Board. Those interests are more intimate, they are more insistent, they are more proximate, and with every intention to be fair to more remote interests the people at the door are likely to get the best chance. In confirmation of this view I may quote one of the recent Presidents of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Mr. Waiter Long, when President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, was interviewed in Edinburgh on this very subject by Sir Mark Stewart and other prominent proprietors and agriculturists in Scotland. They went to him with a proposal for a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0265"/>
<col>521</col>
branch board&#x2014;exactly what the noble Lord wishes now. Mr. Walter Long, in refusing it, said&#x2014;
<quote>"Depend upon it you must not make two bites at a cherry. If you are going to alter anything you must alter the whole thing and have a separate and independent Board."</quote>
That was really the effect of his criticism. He was against it; he thought it would be disastrous; and he said, "]f you are going to make any change at all change it altogether, and do not make an alteration which will not bring you really any nearer to the supreme authority than you now are by posting a letter from Edinburgh to London." That deals with the present work done by the Board supposing there were no Bill and no small holdings and no machinery provided by this Bill to promote new agricultural work.<lb/>
But the Bill itself proposes that there shall be a Commissioner for Small Holdings. One member of the Board is to be a Commissioner for Small Holdings; he is to initiate schemes for small holdings. Then, again, the general interests of agriculture and of forestry are to be undertaken by the Board. Let me lay some stress upon forestry as an industry in which in the future from its national characteristics Scotland is bound to play the leading part of either of the three countries in this Kingdom. Then there is horticulture, poultry keeping, market gardening, and so forth. I submit that all this work is purely local in character, and to successfully carry it out you must have familiarity and understanding of local conditions and local circumstances. The Congested Districts Board is carrying out such work in the Highlands now, inadequately, perhaps, but still to some good purpose, and I think increasingly so as it is widening its field. Under the Bill the Congested Districts Board disappears, and you get rid of one of these main authorities of which complaint is so frequently made. Under the noble Lord's proposal, on the other hand, the Congested Districts Board remains, and you do not have the economy and the unity and the simplicity which you have under the system of the Bill. You will have two separate administrations. You will have in one part of Scotland the Congested Districts Board promoting agriculture and forestry and poultry keeping and other small industries of the kind, and in the rest of Scotland you will have this branch Department of the Board of Agriculture
<col>522</col>
doing precisely similar work. You will have the Congested Districts Board, unless you make some alteration, making small holdings in the Highland counties. On the other hand, you will have the Commissioner for Small Holdings under the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries making small holdings throughout Scotland, not only in the Lowlands but also in the Highlands. My Lords, I confess I do not see&#x2014;and I have tried to think&#x2014;how the small holdings administration under this Bill can possibly be carried out successfully under the proposal of the noble Lord.<lb/>
Then let me remind the noble Lord, and your Lordships as well, of this. There is a considerable part of agricultural administration now carried on in Scotland besides the work of the Congested Districts Board. There are three Agricultural Colleges which are carrying on not only training, experiments, and research in their colleges, but in the country districts they are carrying out an increasing amount of extension work among the farmers and the farmers' sons and others in these districts. These three colleges are under the Scottish Education Department; they are doing excellent work. what do you propose to do with them? It would. certainly be much more difficult for them to carry on their work if all the other agricultural development work is handed over to the London Department than it would be if, as proposed by the Bill, this work is committed to a Scottish Department working in Edinburgh.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01757"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord talks about its being handed over to the London Department. I would point out to him that it is there now. The Agricultural Colleges are going on under the London Department at the present time, and I have never heard of any difficulty or inconvenience having arisen because of that fact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01758"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That may be so, but you are handing over work under this Bill which is far more extensive than any work that has ever been done by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. If the noble Lord will turn to the Schedule which shows the Acts that are administered by the Board of Agriculture he will see that there is nothing which can be called development work in Scotland carried on at all by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. It carries on the administration of the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0266"/>
<col>523</col>
Contagious Diseases Act and the other administration under the eight or ten Acts which are mentioned in the Schedule; but no work of a kind that would assist the development of small holdings and would assist agriculturists generally, and no work of a kind that would promote forestry, is done by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in Scotland. Everything done in these respects has been done either by the colleges working under the Scottish Education Department or by the Congested Districts Board. I must say, in conclusion, that I think this is a most retrograde proposal. It is turning the clock back, and not only wrecking the whole structure of the machinery of this Bill but adding to the expense of administration by preventing what would otherwise prove to be the economy of the abolition of the Congested Districts Board. I can only repeat to your Lordships that I have heard with the deepest regret the noble Lord's proposal, because it is vital to this measure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01760"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in considering the question of the government of Scottish agriculture this House has not only a right to be heard but a right to demand that His Majesty's Government should consider fairly the arguments brought forward on the other side. I think that we can fairly complain of the answer which the Secretary for Scotland gave to Lord Balfour. I do believe that members of your Lordships' House honestly consider that there is the bulk of agricultural opinion behind the Amendment of Lord Balfour. We see that not only in the expressions of public opinion which have been given at various meetings of farmers and of Chambers of Agriculture in Scotland, but exactly the same demand has been put forward in the northern part of England. I am sure there is hardly a Peer here who does not receive from day to day numbers of communications from individuals and societies stating their objections to this Bill. We have a right to be heard, because these are not questions in which one can say that any prejudice such as that concerning landlordism has played a part. It is a question affecting the tenants much more than the landlords. The landlords do not farm any extensive amount of land compared with that which the tenants
<col>524</col>
farm, and the question is one of making the agriculture of Scotland more prosperous than it is now.<lb/>
I do think that Peers know more about agriculture than some of the Scottish Members in another place. If you look through the list of those gentlemen you will see that a large portion come from this side of the Border, and a considerable portion have no knowledge at all of land, or only what they derive when they visit it, probably at one time in the year. Speaking of the Highland representatives, there is only one man I believe, certainly there are very few, who bear even a Scottish name. The majority of them may have done a summer or two through the Highlands, but as to getting to know the agricultural question&#x2014;well, you have only to listen to the House of Commons debates to learn how uncommonly little they know of the subject at all. Therefore I do think we have a right to have our arguments considered fairly. The noble Lord, Lord Pentland, argued against the statement of Lord Balfour as if the idea was that the Department of Agriculture should be sitting in London. We propose by this Amendment to have a Department sitting in Edinburgh, composed entirely of Scotsmen, in touch with the people and the agricultural interests there; which is a very great move from what we have now. I remember also that Lord Pentland mentioned that these men would have greater powers of initiation; but the President of the Board of Agriculture sits in London, and so does the Secretary for Scotland. There is no difference, provided you have got your Department of Agriculture in Scotland. You would have all the advantage of not being guided, perhaps, by the Secretary for Scotland, but by a man appointed <i>ad hoc</i> for his knowledge; and though the Secretary for Scotland may be omniscient he is not appointed primarily to look after agriculture. Presumably your President in the past has been a man chosen for his particular knowledge of the subject, and we would sooner have a man chosen for his special knowledge of the subject with which he has to deal.<lb/>
As to Lord Pentland's argument that this is a wrecking proposal, I would like to take exception to that. It is not so very far differentiated from Lord Pentland's own suggestion. He suggests that this body should be under the Secretary for
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0267"/>
<col>525</col>
Scotland. We suggest that it should be under the Board of Agriculture, and that instead of having the Department separate it should be a subordinate branch of the Board. It would carry out exactly the same function. There is no reason why the men should be changed. The gentlemen whom Lord Pentland has his eye on to be there, instead of being responsible to the Scottish Department, will be responsible to the people to whom they ought to be responsible&#x2014;namely, to the Board of Agriculture. So much for what the Secretary for Scotland has said.<lb/>
May I be allowed to touch in the briefest way possible on our overwhelming case, as we hold it to be, for a sub-department of the Board of Agriculture? We regard as the most important of all questions in this connection that of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act. We consider that all important; the whole of the agricultural interests are concerned with it, and every single owner or farmer of land is interested in it, because without the certainty of overcoming disease you cannot get that fixity of prices by which alone farmers can hope to compete. Agriculture has sufficient variety of disadvantages to fight against without introducing another disadvantage in the shape of disease. We have in Scotland some of the best blood in the various breeds of cattle and of sheep, not only in the British Isles, but in the world. A considerable portion of our stock is not consumed in the country, but goes out to better the breeds in other parts of the world&#x2014;to the Argentine, Australia, Africa, and so on. By a, double control and the lack of similarity in method and the lack of rapidity in dealing with disease we would risk very considerably the chance of spreading infection.<lb/>
I would point out again what I consider is a most important matter. The British Isles is the only country in Europe practically clear of foot-and-mouth disease. The whole Continent is seized with it. The returns from America show that it is very prevalent in many parts there. If we have a satisfactory condition of things now, why in the name of fortune should we change it? The question of development, which, may I say, Lord Balfour touched very lightly, also concerns the Board of Agriculture at the present moment. No society has voted in favour of Lord Pentland's measure. At the present moment the farmers farm three-fifths,
<col>526</col>
probably five-sixths, of the whole of Scotland, and we ought to be allowed to consider the opinion of those people.<lb/>
Then on the question of research, how much better shall we be placed if we are in touch with the authorities? What difference is there in the various lines of inquiry we want to have as between England and Scotland? There are the same breeds of cattle; even our black-faced sheep you get in the south of England now. Where is the difference? Would it not be advisable to make one inquiry rather than have all inquiries duplicated or going over the same ground? It is all important that we should have our Department of Agriculture in touch with and subject to the same control as your Board of Agriculture here. Then there are two other points which Lord Pentland raised. He talked of forestry, and I would like to ask whether it is not the fact that he is going to take forestry out of the control of the Department? Certainly he sent a letter the other day to say he was going to appoint a Board&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01761"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to interrupt, but what I said to the Arboricultural Society was really what I said on the Second Reading on this subject&#x2014;that it was not the intention of the Government to name one of the three members of the Board as a Commissioner for Forestry, but that it was our intention that there should be under this Board of Agriculture, as an integral part of its administrative machinery, a department dealing with forestry; and I am glad to say that I have since received a letter expressing the gratification of the society on that score.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01762"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I am sure every one will receive with pleasure the statement of the Secretary for Scotland, and will agree that it will tend very considerably to advance matters. But if you are going to have a department for administering this branch, why should it not form a portion of the sub-department of the Board of Agriculture sitting in Scotland?<lb/>
Now as to the congested districts areas, I must say that I think there are two points where there may be some difficulty. I see, on the one hand, that under the suggestion made by Lord Balfour the Congested Districts Board would still exist. I think there is something to be said on that. We in the north of Scotland, at all events, shall welcome the &#x00A3;87,000 voted
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0268"/>
<col>527</col>
by the Conservative Government which is not to be taken away from the congested area; and that, no doubt, would be so if Lord Balfour's Amendment were carried. We would also be very glad to receive in that very poor part of the country the &#x00A3;35,000 as certain, instead of the further &#x00A3;15,000 problematical. I can quite imagine, from the congested area point of view, this being received very well, but, on the other hand, I do see there is a great deal of force in the argument of the Secretary for Scotland that you do not want to have two bodies administering in Scotland. But may I ask the noble Lord why should not this sub-department of the Board of Agriculture undertake these duties? The duties of the Congested Districts Board as at the present moment carried out are very well set out on page 1 of their last year's Report. I need not go into them in detail, but I say that there is not a single one of these congested district duties which could not be carried out by the Board of Agriculture. There is aiding and developing agriculture, providing suitable seeding, making provision for crofters, the migration of crofters, aiding and developing fishing&#x2014;exactly the work of the Board of Agriculture. Why should it go to another body? Then these men are not going to be, as Lord Pentland appeared to imply, some alien body out there, but Scotsmen in Scotland who are going to administer Scottish affairs. And why should not they also go in for improving lighthouses, piers, bridges, footpaths, and so on? That is all part of the development referred to. And then there is aiding spinning and weaving, and so forth. That seems to be all part of agricultural and fishery matters. There was only the sum of &#x00A3;764 spent last year in Scotland in that respect, so that it will not make much odds what you do with it; and in the development of industries &#x00A3;63 only was spent. Therefore when the point comes, which I think occurs in Clause 28, as to whether the Congested Districts Board should form part of the Department in Scotland or whether it should be in London, that can best be discussed at that stage. But I submit now that it would be better for the Congested Districts Board to be merged entirely into the Department for Scotland, because the duties are absolutely those which the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries through these Scotsmen placed in Edinburgh could best perform in the interests of Scotland as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<col>528</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01763"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member> had an Amendment later on the Paper to amend subsection 11 (<i>a</i>)&#x2014;</p>

The noble Lord's Amendment was to insert, after the word "Scotland," the words "except any power or duty exercisable by the Board under the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1894 to 1911, or any Act amending the same."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01765">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have an Amendment on the Paper as to the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, an Amendment which I believe is warmly supported by English and Scottish agriculturists and would, if accepted, be considered as a satisfactory way of meeting the anticipated danger of the proposed transference. But I am placed in rather a strange position, because, obviously, if Lord Balfour carries his Amendment mine will be shut out, and I shall have no opportunity of putting my case. I would venture to say, with regard to the proposed sub-department, that it may be called, in my humble opinion, a counsel of perfection. My noble friend is not the first person who has thought of setting up such a sub-department. As far back as 1892 some of us had dreams of a department and offices in Edinburgh, with officials in close and continuous and intimate touch with special Scottish interest, but we certainly never dreamed of making that department independent, or of transferring to it the administration of these highly important Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01766">Had the setting up of a sub-department been the original proposition of the Government, I would say with all respect that it would have been a wise and statesmanlike act, and I think it would have received the approval of agriculturists generally. But that was not the course adopted. A more ambitious plan has been before the country for some time past&#x2014;namely, that of setting up in Scotland an independent
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0269"/>
<col>529</col>
Board of Agriculture solely for that country. That proposition has been before Scotland for a good many years. It has been put forward at two General Elections, and it has been mentioned at by-elections. It has been proposed by two Cabinets, and it has been several times before the House of Commons. The Third Reading of this Bill was passed there only the other day without a dissentient voice and therefore, with all my predisposition to favour the noble Lord's Amendment, I think it would be impossible for any Government in such circumstances to accept so drastic an alteration of their measure; moreover, to expect the House of Commons to reverse their verdict would be to expect too much. Therefore although I think that it may be the counsel of perfection, I could not myself under the present circumstances give the Amendment that whole-hearted support which I should have done at an earlier period and under different conditions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01767">But, on the other hand, my noble friend's Amendment has a bearing on the very important question of the transference of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts to an independent Board of Agriculture in Scotland, and I would ask the indulgence of the House if I go somewhat fully&#x2014;I hope not too fully&#x2014;into the reasons why such a proposal seems, I believe almost generally, very dangerous to British farmers and stock breeders. If you transferred these Acts to an independent body in Scotland you would obviously destroy the central authority and you would set up in the island of Great Britain a divided or dual control. In my humble opinion that would be a great and serious mischief. We have only to look back to what has been brought about for agriculture by the central authority, which has been in force now for a good number of years, to see what danger will result if we return to the conditions which existed a great many years ago. Those of us who are unfortunately old enough to remember it, know that prior to the establishment of the central authority to administer these Acts the duty of suppressing cattle diseases rested with local authorities. I have no hesitation in saying that the condition that ensued was chaos, and chaos of a very extensive nature. Luckily since 1877 we have had no outbreak in this country of cattle plague, or what used to
<col>530</col>
be called rinderpest, but some of its can remember when it came into this country and wrought great havoc over Great Britain and entailed an enormous expense on the ratepayers of the country. I have been told of one county in the west of England in which during one outbreak of rinderpest no less than &#x00A3;10,000 a year was entailed upon the ratepayers in that county, and I am not at all sure that they are not paying it at the present moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01768">Then a central authority was set up. Originally it was an Agricultural Committee of the Privy Council, under the direction of the Lord President, and then in 1889 the present Board of Agriculture was instituted. I know your Lordships do not like to be troubled with figures, but I must give a few to show what great success followed the establishment of one central supreme authority for Great Britain with regard to the administration of these Acts. Perhaps I had better say, first, that there are two major diseases of animals which afflict farmers&#x2014;pleuro-pneumonia, and foot-and-mouth disease. In 1883 there were 75 counties in Great Britain afflicted with foot-and-month disease; there were 18,752 outbreaks of that disease; 219,289 cattle, 277,492 sheep, and 24,332 pigs were affected by that disease all at the same time. With regard to pleuro-pneumonia, 40 counties were affected&#x2014;there were 439 outbreaks. That was rather a good year for pleuro-pneumonia, and I could quote easily another year in which 71 counties were affected and in which there were thousands of outbreaks. What is the position at the present moment, after twenty-two years or more of the Board of Agriculture? My Lords, the last statistics are these. In 1910 there were 3 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, and 13 cattle affected; there is no pleuro-pneumonia in the country at all, and it has not existed for the last eleven years. Now what I say&#x2014;and I say it with some knowledge of the matter&#x2014;is that the main factor in bringing about this most satisfactory result to our farmers is the existence of a central and sole authority for the whole of Great Britain. If that the case I think we are justified in asking why this central authority should be destroyed, and what arguments there are which should induce us to reverse a policy which has been so highly successful. I confess that personally I have heard none.
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0270"/>
<col>531</col>
I have read many letters and articles in newspapers in support of the proposition, but I am bound to say that I could not find in any one of them anything of a convincing nature.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01769">There are two arguments, it is true&#x2014;specious arguments&#x2014;which might affect those who are not thoroughly acquainted with the subject. But, in the view of those who really know, I venture to think that these two arguments contain the minimum of knowledge and the maximum of misunderstanding. I will now state to your Lordships, if I am not detaining you too long, those two arguments, and tell you the answer to them. In the first place it is said that stock breeders in England and elsewhere in Great Britain are made very nervous by this Bill, because they are afraid that if you set up an independent Department in Scotland there may be some future Minister&#x2014;it may be under some scheme of Home Rule&#x2014;who will be foolish enough or ignorant enough to let animals into that country from some infected place on the Continent. That is absolutely a mistake, say these gentlemen. You have got Mr. Walter Long's Act of 1896 which orders that every animal is to be slaughtered at the port and not allowed into the interior of the land, and you are perfectly safe, they say, because Mr. Long's Act can only be reversed by an Act of Parliament, and therefore the admission of animals by some foolish Minister in some part of the country would be quite impossible. My Lords, the people who say that do not know what Mr. Long's Act means. Mr. Long's Act is directed amongst minor diseases against one major disease, that is pleuro-pneumonia, and its success has been enormous, for, as I have already said, we have not had a case of that kind for eleven years. But it is not a safeguard against foot-and-mouth disease, and for this reason&#x2014;if I am not getting too scientific. Pleuro-pneumonia is one of those diseases that can only be communicated by what is called "immediate infection" &#x2014;that is to say, the diseased animal must cone into contact with the healthy animal before the latter can contract the malady. But foot-and-mouth disease and cattle plague are conveyed by what is called "mediate infection"&#x2014;that is to say, if the animal has got into the country, even at the ports, and any one has been near it, even an animal, perhaps a bird,
<col>532</col>
infection can be carried all over the country at a moment's notice. Therefore slaughtering at the ports is no remedy against foot and mouth disease. The power of prohibiting animals absolutely from landing in the country, which is the only remedy, still rests with the Minister of Agriculture, and that power would undoubtedly be transferred to an independent Minister in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01770">It may be said, that the two Ministers would act in unison, but when you come to a lesser area than the whole, the pressure that is brought to bear upon a Minister is far greater than it is when the Minister represents the whole country. I know a case in which some people in Scotland were very anxious to upset the Minister for Agriculture of the day. Some time ago in the nineties, it was found necessary to prevent the introduction of Canadian cattle from the Dominion on account of the prevalence of pleuro-pneumonia there. Many people in Scotland resented that action, because a great many Scottish feeders were accustomed to get their store cattle from Canada, and they thought they got them cheaper than from Ireland. A great agitation was set up in Scotland, deputations were sent to London and resolutions passed, and Members of Parliament moved in the House on it. My Lords, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that bad there been at that time a purely Scottish Minister invested with this power, he would have found it extremely difficult to have resisted the very powerful influences in Scotland that were then at work against him. All the same, I think that the Board of Agriculture of that day was not mistaken in what it did, because in 1802, in the year that. Canada was scheduled, ten counties in England were affected with pleuro-pnuemonia; there were thirty-five outbreaks, and 3,477 cattle were slaughtered; whereas three years afterwards, in 1895, there was only one county affected, and only one outbreak.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01771">The other argument, which, as I have said, is a specious one, is what I will call the analogy of the Irish Agricultural Board. It is said, "Oh, you have an independent Board in Ireland with full and plenary powers and with a Minister of their own who administers these Contagious Diseases Acts. It has been a great success there;
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0271"/>
<col>533</col>
why should you not have that also in Scotland? "The reason, I think, is very obvious. Between Great Britain and Ireland there is a great stretch of sea, between Scotland and England there is nothing but a land frontier. If under any possible conditions an Irish Minister were to let in any diseased animals from foreign countries, which he might do under the powers which I pointed out just now, and he allowed them to land at the ports for slaughter, then of course the British Board of Agriculture if it did its duty would absolutely prohibit the landing of Irish cattle in this country, and it would undoubtedly do so under those circumstances whether there was disease in Ireland or not. As long as they let animals from a country in which there is disease enter Ireland, one may look upon Ireland as merely a funnel by which disease might come from foreign countries into this country. But supposing the same thing happened in Scotland, how could you possibly hold the frontier of Scotland against disease? It would be almost impossible to stop stray cattle or sheep crossing the Border. There would be much the same difficulty as the Canadians feel with regard to their long land frontier. If there is disease in America itself the introduction of it into Canada may occasionally take place whatever precautions may be taken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01772">Now, my Lords, this transference of the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts to a purely Scottish Minister not only destroys the sole central authority in Great Britain, but, I venture to think, also weakens and endangers certain important qualifications in the Minister which are absolutely necessary for the successful administration of these particular Acts. One thing that is necessary is what I may call firmness of administration&#x2014;not only with your officials but against all pressure, whether it be your own Party pressure or Parliamentary pressure. I could not give a better example than by referring to the way in which Mr. Long cleared this country of hydrophobia. Everybody knows the opposition there was to that measure. Almost everybody who had a dog objected to having it muzzled. There was a strong agitation in the country. It was made, I am almost ashamed to say, one of the subjects at by-elections, and yet Mr. Long stood firm, and we are at this day one of the very few countries whose inhabitants
<col>534</col>
need not dread that most terrible disease. If Mr. Long had been the Minister of only a portion of the country, however important that portion might be, and if the agitation had been especially strong in that portion of the country, he would have found it extremely difficult, courageous as he might be, to maintain his position in this matter. Mr. Long spoke as the Minister for Great Britain, and therefore he spoke with authority, and naturally he carried his point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01773">There is only one other subject to which I wish to refer with regard to the transference of these powers. It carried out it may very reasonably and possibly interfere with another important point of administration&#x2014;promptitude of action. There is nothing so essential to carrying out these Acts successfully as acting promptly and at once. I remember a good many years ago an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, in London of all places. It was late in the Autumn. It was not so very far off the Cattle Show, from which you will see what great danger would have come about had it spread amongst the prize animals gathered together in the metropolis. That outbreak, as soon as announced almost, was scheduled, officials were sent immediately, the infected area was surrounded, and in, I think, not more than a few weeks the disease was suppressed, and so effectively that very few people in London knew it had occurred. Well, such an outbreak as that might also easily happen on the borders between Scotland and England, and if you had two Ministers it is quite possible that those Ministers might differ as to what their action ought to be. I know that all members of all Governments live together in brotherly love; but Departments very often differ on subjects which are of interest to both Departments and differ sometimes very strongly. These two Departments might very well differ in such a case; it is quite probable they would. The veterinary officer on one side might take a view of the diagnosis different from that of the other officer. And what would result? Delay might result whilst the two Departments were coming together, and that delay would be fatal to the administration of these Acts, because a delay of hours. to say nothing of days, would be a source of infinite danger in the case of highly infectious diseases, not only to the locality affected, but practically throughout the whole of Great Britain.</p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0272"/>
<col>535</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01774">Then, again, when outbreaks take place it is necessary to send down at once a sufficient number of veterinary and other inspectors. At the present moment the British Board of Agriculture has 112 inspectors, veterinary and other, at its disposal. Those inspectors are not confined to England; they are British and go also to Scotland. But in Scotland, allocated to Scotland for special Scottish purposes, there are only five inspectors and one veterinary officer. Therefore it is easy to see what would happen if you set up an independent Board for Scotland to-morrow and cut it off from the British Board and made the British Board into an English Board. The latter would still require a large number of inspectors; but the whole of those inspectors now are at the service naturally of Scotland. My noble friend Lord Carrington knows very well that in 1908 there were outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Scotland. What did he do? He sent down a proper number of these inspectors to Scotland, and the disease was promptly suppressed. Therefore you must only have, as now allocated, five inspectors for Scotland, or you must set up in that country a great number of what I should call unnecessary inspectors, and at a very high expense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01775">What expert opinion is there behind the proposition of my noble friend in this Bill? Expert opinion I say advisedly, because you would not stop a man in the street and ask his opinion casually as to whether a microbe was of a particular nature, or how you ought to set about the culture of a particular bacillus. You go at once to an expert. These Acts are based upon science and are carried out in a scientific manner. Now what is the opinion of agricultural experts in Great Britain on this subject? I think I am right in saying that all the great agricultural societies of England with their expert knowledge are against the proposition in the Bill. And in Scotland the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture, which represents all the associations of Scotland and which has, I understand, amongst its members 16,000 farmers, voted against a Scottish Board of Agriculture and put forward as a main reason the danger of the transference of the administration of these particular Contagious Diseases Acts in Scotland to a Board independent of the central authority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01776">Then, my Lords, what is the opinion of
<col>536</col>
those on whose shoulders the burden of administering these Acts has fallen during the last twenty years? Mr. Chaplin is against the proposal in the Bill, and he was the first President of the Board of Agriculture. Mr. Walter Long is against it. So also is Sir Ailwyn Fellowes. As to Mr. Hanbury, unfortunately he is no more with us and therefore I cannot state his opinion definitely, but nobody who followed his strenuous career could for a moment doubt what that opinion would be. Another Minister of Agriculture, lately passed away, Lord Onslow, so much respected by all agriculturists, was against it. I can speak with confidence of his opinion, because I often discussed the matter with him, and I know that in putting down my Amendment I am not merely carrying out his wishes but his ardent desires.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01777">There is only one other point of general interest upon which I wish to touch. It is said that the establishment of this proposed new Board of Agriculture is much desired by those who are in favour of Home Rule for Scotland. They think that the establishment of a separate Department, with full powers in a Scottish Minister of their own, is a principal stepping stone, an important stepping stone, towards the fulfillment of their wishes. All I can say about that is that the transference of the administration of these special Acts to a Scottish Department is going beyond any Home Rule that ever entered into the minds of the wildest Home Ruler, and I will show the House why. What is the definition, the authoritative, accepted definition of Home Rule for Ireland? It is control over purely local, purely Irish affairs. Now I suppose for Scotland it would be the same&#x2014;control over purely local and purely Scottish affairs. But cattle disease as long as Scotland remains an integral part of Great Britain is not a purely local affair, nor a purely Scottish affair; it is a British affair. If that is the kind of Home Rule that Home Rulers desire there, we might as well give them the Post Office, and I venture to think that, when the people understand what it means, this proposition will not further the cause of Home Rule amongst the intelligent electorate of Great Britain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01778">I have gone fully&#x2014;I hope at not too great length&#x2014;into this subject, and I did so because it is one that is little discussed
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0273"/>
<col>537</col>
and little understood. It is very technical, not suitable for platforms, and very dull, as I have no doubt your Lordships have discovered for yourselves during the progress of my speech. But at the same time it is a question of the highest importance to agriculture. It is, moreover, the most important, as it is the most successful, duty the Board of Agriculture has to perform. It is a question that affects most vitally the interests of breeders and feeders in the United Kingdom, and during the lust twenty-two years hundreds of thousands, nay possibly millions, of pounds have been saved to the country and to agricultural interests through the proper administration of these Acts. Therefore if I had an opportunity of moving my Amendment&#x2014;and I am afraid I shall not&#x2014;I should have hoped that it would have received favourable consideration, not only from this House but from the Government, because I believe that in opposing this proposed transference of the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts to an independent Scottish Minister I have at my back the almost unanimous support of the expert agriculturists of Great Britain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01779"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat clown has addressed the House with the knowledge and experience of a past-President of the Board of Agriculture, and all he has said mast surely command the sympathy and approval of the great majority of your Lordships. for myself, at any rate, I may say this, that I think he has dealt with what I may call the <i>crux</i> of the question, but at the same time the subject of the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts is not, perhaps, directly raised by the Amendment now before the House. However, it is indirectly raised, and therefore the noble Lord was quite within his right in making the speech he did, because no doubt if the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Balfour is carried, though it might not be practically impassible, it would be technically difficult for Lord Burghclere to move his Amendment. The Amendment of Lord Balfour proposes that this body which is to have power with regard to agricultural affairs in Scotland should be a merely subordinate department of the Board of Agriculture, and clearly, that being so, there would not technically be a divided administration
<col>538</col>
of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts in the two Kingdoms.<lb/>
I sympathise most thoroughly with all that my noble friend Lord Balfour has said with regard to the mistake, as it seems to me it is, of the proposal to divide the Board of Agriculture in Great Britain. I should like to see the Board of Agriculture in Great Britain maintained precisely as it is, with power over the whole Kingdom, administered from Whitehall. That is what we have at present, and I believe it is the best thing. But now we have to choose between the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Balfour, who would set up a Committee of the Board of Agriculture at Edinburgh subordinate&#x2014;so he thinks&#x2014;to the Board of Agriculture in London, and the proposal of His Majesty's Government for a separate Board of Agriculture for Scotland. Now if I could believe that a separate Committee of the Board of Agriculture once set up at Edinburgh would continue subordinate to the Board of Agriculture in London I might be more favourably disposed towards my noble friend's proposal. But I have had some experience of public administration, and I am quite sure of this, that if you were to set up a Department of the kind, from the very moment that it was set up, it would endeavour to attract to itself more and more authority over Scottish agriculture, as compared with the authority of its nominal superior, the Board of Agriculture in London.<lb/>
Now let us see how it would be set up. The Secretary for Scotland is a member of the Board of Agriculture <i>ex officio</i>. We may be quite sure&#x2014;it would be his duty&#x2014;that the Secretary for Scotland would take care that the Committee set up under my noble friend's proposal was a purely Scottish Committee, that it was representative of what he believed to be simply and solely Scottish opinion, and that it would do what it had to do in administration or in recommendation to the Head Office in London in accordance with Scottish opinion. It would be, in fact, a separate tribunal front the Head Office in London. I believe it would be perfectly certain that that tribunal would become practically independent of the Board of Agriculture in London. And why? What is the reason for setting it up at all? It is because you want some kind of separate
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0274"/>
<col>539</col>
administration in Scotland of matters connected with agriculture. That is the principle on which it is to be set up. That, I think, would result from my noble friend's proposal. It would, to my mind, be very much like taking two bites at a cherry, and I think the opinion which Lord Pentland quoted from Mr. Long upon this subject was a wise opinion, and it is one with which I cordially agree.<lb/>
On the other hand, what is the proposal of the Government? It is to set up a Board of Agriculture with power to administer for Scotland all the Acts relating to agriculture, as a separate authority from the Board of Agriculture in London. Well, my Lords, I dislike that proposal, but I dislike it mainly on account of the very matter which Lord Burghclere dwelt upon with such force&#x2014;namely, the question of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts. If you were to retain the administration of the Diseases of Animals Acts in the Board of Agriculture in London and make almost all otherpower over to a Board of Agriculture in Edinburgh, I do not believe you would be doing very much harm. At any rate you would not do the infinite mischief that would be done by a divided administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts by two authorities in the United Kingdom. I must say that of all proposals that could be made by His Majesty's Government I believe nothing could be more hateful to every fanner in England than that, and from what has been said to-night I believe it to be objectionable to the farmers in Scotland. Then why is it to be made? Simply, as far as I know, because it is supposed to have the support of the Scottish Members in the other House. I have never been able to understand, why Scottish agriculturists have not the same influence over the Members for Scottish counties as agriculturists in England have over their Members. I do not profess to have a knowledge of Scottish affairs, but that does appear to be the case. I am quite sure that, whatever his political opinions, you would not find an English county Member representing anything that could be called an agricultural district who would not vote against the proposal of His Majesty's Government upon this matter.<lb/>
Now is it not possible for His Majesty's Government to yield to what has been said with such force and power by one of
<col>540</col>
their own supporters, Lord Burghclere? Is it not possible for them to exempt the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts from the powers of the Scottish Board of Agriculture? I do not say that it is a good thing to set up a separate Scottish Board of Agriculture at all, but I do feel that the matter has now gone so far that it is extremely difficult for your Lordships to resist it. It has been supported, no doubt, by the great body of Scottish opinion in another place. It has been the policy of His Majesty's Government for years past; they have practically nailed their flag to the mast upon the subject, and there could be no reasonable doubt in the minds of any of us that if this proposal is struck out of this Bill the Bill would be dropped for the session, and would not at any rate for some time become law. Do any of your Lordships desire that, because of the difference, which in my belief would not be a permanent difference, between the proposal of my noble friend Lord Balfour and the proposal of His Majesty's Government upon this subject, the Bill should be lost for this session? In my belief the point we ought to insist upon, and as to which I believe we shall be backed up by the great body of agricultural opinion in the whole of Great Britain, is the exclusion of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts from the power of the new Scottish Board of Agriculture. Let us insist at whatever cost, even the loss of the Bill if necessary, that there shall not be in this island a divided authority upon that most important subject, and I believe we shall have with us the support of everybody interested in agriculture both in Scotland and in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01780"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland to accept Lord Burghclere's Amendment. I think His Majesty's Government would be well advised to give satisfaction in this respect. It is the absolute and general demand of nearly all experts on the subject north arid south of the Tweed. With regard to the proposed Board of Agriculture, I think that we in Scotland ought to have a Board of Agriculture within easy access of all those who have any agricultural interest to put before it. I need only point out that the Bill which we are at present discussing has not been introduced by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries but by the Scottish Office. It
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0275"/>
<col>541</col>
strikes me that it would be very abnormal in the case of a Bill introduced by one Department to give the administration of it to another Department. I am fully aware of the excellent work achieved in Scotland by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and of the great experience which during recent years it has gathered. But, on the other hand, when we see how admirably agricultural education has been developed in Scotland by the Scottish Education Department, I do not see that there is any reason to doubt that if we obtain a separate Board of Agriculture, that Board will, under the guidance of the Scottish Office, be of immense use for the development of agriculture and forestry, and that, at all events, there will be plenty of work for it to do. I need only point out what has been done for agriculture in Ireland by the Irish Board of Agriculture, and the same results will I think accrue in Scotland if the choice of the members who will constitute the Board in Scotland is made with great care and discrimination, for obviously the members of that Board will have great influence in the exercise of the powers which they will have to give effect to the provisions of this Bill. I agree with what has been said by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, that if the Amendment of Lord Balfour of Burleigh were accepted the situation thereby created would inevitably develop in destroying the control of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries over the department which would then become independent. There is another proposal which has been put forward&#x2014;namely, that the Scottish Board of Agriculture should be represented in another place by one of its members. Sooner or later that result may follow, but for the present I do not think it would be desirable to create this appointment. I shall vote against the proposal of Lord Balfour, but I shall feel bound to vote for the Amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Burghclere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01781"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps it might be convenient if I stated the opinion of His Majesty's Government on this question of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts which is raised by the Amendment and speech of my noble friend Lord Burghclere. I should like to say that I recognise the spirit in which the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, has advised the House in this matter. There are two points of view from which this matter is considered:
<col>542</col>
one the point of view of English farmers and English agricultural opinion generally, and the other&#x2014;as to which I do not express any opinion at this moment&#x2014;the point of view of Scottish opinion and of Scottish farmers. Various noble Lords have severely criticised the Government for so directly flying in the face of what is deemed to be the unanimous Scottish agricultural opinion adverse to the proposal in the Bill. I would fain be as little controversial as possible and therefore shall be brief, but your Lordships will perhaps allow me to draw attention to a passage from a letter which appeared in the <i>Morning Post</i> on the day of the Second Reading of this Bill. It was written by a member of the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture. He is not known to me, and he describes himself as a Unionist in politics. These are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"So far as the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture is concerned, the majority present at the different meetings where this subject was discussed (lid vote against the separation, but there was always a very respectable minority, and, as a member of that minority and later a director of that body, I have always maintained that the Chamber on this question did not represent the true views of the great mass of agriculturists "&#x2014;</quote></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01786"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: What is his name?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01787"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Mr. James Elder. Instead of giving my own opinion, I quote that opinion which is easily accessible. I can assure noble Lords that from members of local authorities concerned in the control of these diseases, from practical agriculturists, from owners of stock, and from those engaged in the selling of stock, I have opinions' heartily supporting the proposals of the Government. I say this simply to assure the House that this proposal has not been inserted in the Bill
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0276"/>
<col>543</col>
and has not remained in the Bill without substantial support being behind it. Much of the criticism which has been levelled at this proposal proceeds on the assumption that we in Scotland do not recognise the importance of keeping that country as well as England free from contagious diseases. On the contrary, it is entirely from a desire and belief that we can in Scotland make the administration of these Acts more efficient, and therefore a better protection for Scotland and for England, that we make this proposal.<lb/>
In the first place there is the question of delay. Can it be maintained for a moment that more prompt administrative action cannot be taken by a Board located in Edinburgh than when everything has to be referred for decision to a Board in London? I could cite cases where disease has existed in a locality for eight or twelve days before it has been publicly announced, and in our belief all these delays might have been greatly reduced if an authority more accessible to farmers was absolutely on the spot. Then let me mention another point in which this presses very hardly upon Scottish farmers. This year there has been an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England. There has been no foot-and-mouth disease in Scotland, yet the export of pedigree stock from Scotland has been prohibited because of the existence of the disease in England. A number of Ayrshire cattle were bought early this year for export, but their export has been forbidden because of the foot-and-mouth disease in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01788"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Quite right, too.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01789"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: But surely it is possible to imagine an efficient Board in England and an efficient Board in Scotland under circumstances which would not inflict a disability on one country when it was free from diseased? This brings me to the question of the Board, and I confess I cannot follow my noble friend in comparing the Scottish Border of eighty miles, fifty or sixty of which is river and mountain, every acre of which is closely farmed and confined by fences on either side&#x2014;I cannot follow Lord Burghclere when he compares the difficulty of preventing disease crossing that Border with the Canadian Border of 2,200 miles, where, as he knows, there cannot be the same control. Moreover, with the exception of
<col>544</col>
a few sheep, the great mass of stock go by rail. The great export from Scotland is fat cattle, and they go by rail, and hundreds and thousands of sheep travel in the same way from Scotland to England.<lb/>
But I did not rise to dwell upon this point, but rather to endeavour, so far as I am able, to meet the suggestion of the noble Viscount. In saying what I have said on this point, I have merely touched the fringe of the subject in order to assure your Lordships that the Government and those who have advised them in this matter have proceeded on what, in their opinion, is wholly substantial ground. Scottish farmers do not see why their country should not be as free from disease as England or freer than England. From its proximity to the Continent, from the large number of ports through which there is a traffic from the Continent, from its very much larger area, England is much more prone to disease than Scotland, and it is solely owing to a recognition of the importance of freeing the country from disease, and from the belief that a Scottish authority would be at least competent to keep Scotland free from disease and so aid in the protection of English flocks and herds as well as their own, that the Government have made this proposal. But I recognise that the opinion of this House is overwhelmingly against what the Government propose in this respect, and it was not my intention, had the Amendment of Lord Burghclere been reached&#x2014;or if it be reached it is not my intention&#x2014;to advise my noble friends to divide against the Amendment, and I shall represent to my colleagues the strong views which are held by this House on this subject. I differentiate this point from the general question of the establishment of a Board of Agriculture for Scotland. That is a vital and integral part of our proposal, and from that, my Lords, I am afraid I cannot budge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01790"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in moving his Amendment, stated very clearly the objections which Scottish agriculturists have to the proposals under this Bill for a separate Board of Agriculture in Scotland. I had intended to add many objections which have come to me from a large number of agriculturists in England, but the admirable remarks we heard from Lord Burghclere make it, I think, unnecessary for me to deal with that particular matter, and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0277"/>
<col>545</col>
I should like to say how gratified we are at his admirable contribution to this particular part of the debate. We do recognise, from his own personal knowledge and the authority which he has obtained as a President of the Board of Agriculture, that he brings weight to bear in this particular debate which none or very few of us are able to do. I agree very largely with a good deal of what the noble Lord has told us. He described the present Amendment of Lord Balfour as "a counsel of perfection." I gather he would like to have supported it, but he has been unable to do so because he considers the last two General Elections in Scotland have settled the question. Is not that attaching too great importance to the General Elections that have taken place? I admit it would have been reasonable if the Secretary for Scotland had said that in consequence of those elections they could say that Scotland had supported the Small Holdings Bill. But in going to one detail of this, and the Board of Agriculture is only a detail&#x2014;to say, because at the General Elections in Scotland the electors returned a larger number of Liberals as compared with Unionists, that therefore the whole of Scotland was in favour of this separation, and to use that as an argument against the Amendment of Lord Balfour of Burleigh, is, I think, going a great deal too far.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Burghclere, spoke in the highest terms of the absolute necessity for a central and supreme authority for the administration of the Diseases of Animals Acts. In that the noble Lord agrees with letters which I have received from a large number of Chambers of Agriculture in England pointing out the grave danger of any decentralisation of the management of these Acts. Lord Burghclere also paid a very high tribute &#x2014;one which we will all gladly acknowledge&#x2014;to the management of these diseases by the Board in recent years. I know agriculturists themselves acknowledge the debt of gratitude which they owe to the Board and its very efficient staff for keeping down the spread of these diseases. But the noble Lord told us that his Amendment, which he fears he may not be able to propose, would be a satisfactory settlement of the question. I understand the noble Viscount, speaking for the Front Opposition Bench, agrees with that.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01792"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount says it is all we shall get. But is it the best solution of the question? The Secretary for Scotland, on behalf of the Government, has, f understand, offered not to oppose it. I admit at once that if you can prevent the separation of the administration of these Acts you are doing a very great thing. Yon are doing that which English agriculturalists ask for, at all events, and which they would be satisfied with, but I would like the noble Lord to consider this. Supposing you do carry, even with the consent of the Government, this keeping of the administration of these Acts under the English Board and at the same time set up a separate Board for Scotland, how long will the separate Board for Scotland allow this English and therefore alien Board to exercise any control over their field of agriculture? I do not believe it possible that the noble Lord himself could withstand the pressure which would be brought to get an alteration of that arrangement. Consider what happens now in an ordinary outbreak of disease. A certain area has to be scheduled. It is very difficult indeed for any one to describe or define that area. You will get the very gravest objection from anybody who happens to be, unfortunately, within that area, and if the slightest thing went wrong with the administration in Scotland I do not think the Secretary for Scotland could prevent bringing forward a measure to bring the management of these diseases entirely under his own Board. That is my objection to this proposal. I do not think English agriculturists should be put off with the idea that it will be in any sense a permanent arrangement. If the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh is carried, there would be no difficulty about the matter. It would remain under the management of the British Board, not the English Board but the Board responsible for the agricultural management of the whole of the kingdom, and I have no doubt whatever that it would be a lasting arrangement.<lb/>
The proposal to set up this separate Board for Scotland, as has been shown, has received very strong opposition in Scotland. The noble Lord, Lord Pentland, has read a communication from, I presume, an eminent agriculturist doubting whether
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0278"/>
<col>547</col>
it is the fact that there is such an opposition. I understood from the letter that he was doubting whether the people of Scotland generally were opposed to the separation of the two countries in this matter. There may be a large number of people in Scotland who would like to have a separate Board entirely for agricultural work, but I do not believe there is any body of agriculturists, indeed no agriculturist as far as I know, willing to have the management of agriculture put into the hands of the Scottish Office. That is the main objection which Scottish agriculturists have always taken to the measure, and I do find it difficult to understand why the Government themselves should be so bent upon forcing this proposal against the large body of Scottish agricultural opinion.<lb/>
I would go further and say I find it difficult to understand why a proposal for the alteration of the Board of Agriculture should come into this measure at all, for, after all, this is a measure for the creation of small holdings. The question of the Board of Agriculture really does not arise. We can have the small holdings, if we require them, entirely apart from the Board. The only excuse for bringing it into the Bill would be that by your proposed separation you bring some benefit to agriculture, but there has been no suggestion whatever of any benefit to agriculture. I do not know whether the noble Lord can give any idea of how the actual separation is going to be of any advantage. It is difficult to find any advantage at all, but there are certain disadvantages which are obvious to any one who considers the question. At present agriculture in Scotland is managed by a Department fully equipped for the purpose. True from time to time there has been dissatisfaction about the management of the Board of Agriculture in Scotland, but so there has been in England. We are all agreed that we ought to have more money to carry out agricultural improvements; but I understand that the reason Scottish ideals have never been carried out is that, so far, Scotland has not been anything like unanimous as to what its desires are. But now they are more unanimous than they have ever been. They do not want the Scottish Office to control their agriculture, and by a large majority, at all events in the Central Chamber and the highland Society, they are anxious to have a Department
<col>548</col>
as proposed by Lord Balfour of Burleigh. To take the control from a body which is thoroughly equipped for the purpose and put it in the hands of the Scottish Office, which has not the knowledge or experience possessed by the Board of Agriculture, appears to us to be very bad business indeed.<lb/>
The position really seems to be this. The Government are proposing a Department of Agriculture under the Scottish Office, and the other proposal is for a Scottish Department of Agriculture under the Board of Agriculture. It is essential that whatever body we are to have in Scotland should be controlled and managed by those who are competent to carry out the matter from experience. I feel certain that the noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal (Earl Carrington) would agree that the work of managing an Agricultural Department is quite sufficient to occupy the attention of one man as a principal. The noble Earl, whose too early retirement from the Board of Agriculture has caused regret to agriculturists because we have the pleasantest possible recollections of his work and the energy and ardour he threw into it, would, I am certain, readily recognise that agriculture must Le managed by a President and by a Department who are there for the purpose of managing it; and it would be a misfortune to agriculture generally if it was put in the hands of another Department, where it would really become one among the many other details to which that Department has to attend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01793"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have listened to three or four very able speeches since dinner but I must remark with regard to two of them that they appear very clearly to some of us to be speeches of Englishmen delivered on a Scottish subject. Let me take the remarks of Lord Burghclere first. He referred to Lord Balfour of Burleigh's Amendment as "a counsel of perfection," and said he would have been willing to support it but could not support it at this stage. But I was very much surprised to find that right to the end of his speech he went on and on giving nothing but support to Lord Balfour's Amendment. The reason was perfectly plain. The part of this question in which Lord Burghclere is interested is the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts. Exactly the same thing applies to the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. He feels very strongly
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0279"/>
<col>549</col>
on the administration of those Acts. But what neither of those noble Lords feels upon this is the question which most agitates us; they are Englishmen and do not enter into it. My noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn went so far as to say that he did not understand why Scottish agriculturists had not more influence upon Scottish Members. If the noble Viscount had lived in Scotland he would know that the agricultural portion of Scottish constituencies is, comparatively speaking, very small in almost all the constituencies.<lb/>
The question which really agitates us is this: We do not want a Department under the Secretary for Scotland. That is what Scottish agricultural opinion has declared against. As was pointed out, at not one of the meetings was there any one who would propose the Government plan of a Department under the Secretary for Scotland. The Secretary for Scotland is a member of a number of Boards already. He is very much overworked. If there is a more overworked man, I should say it is the Permanent Under-Secretary for Scotland. Both are members of several Boards. I see sometimes that Lord Pentland, as Chairman of the Congested District Board reports to Lord Pentland as Secretary for Scotland, and I have no doubt you will find the same thing with regard to other Boards. The truth is the Secretary for Scotland has a great deal more work than he can do, and has no time to give to any of these things. Yet he says to-night, "Give the Secretary for Scotland this Department, and it will be attended to." The noble Lord did not add "for the first time"; but that was hinted by the remark that the President of the Board of Agriculture resides in London and we were left to suppose that the Secretary for Scotland lives in Scotland. But he is just as much in London as the President of the Board of Agriculture. Therefore that really does not touch the question.<lb/>
I am quite free to say that the difficulty I see in Lord Balfour's proposal, as he laid it before us, is with regard to the Congested Districts Board. I have been speaking and thinking of it a good deal since he mentioned it to us, and I cannot myself see why the Congested Districts Board cannot be part of the Scottish Department of the Board of Agriculture. Take this Commissioner for Agriculture. Why cannot he be a part or one of the Board, one of the Scottish branch of the Board? And with
<col>550</col>
regard to rent and questions of that sort, of course they will be dealt with by the Land Court all over Scotland. It seems to me, making that slight change in Lord Balfour's proposal, that it might be acceptable. At all events, Lord Burghclere says it is "a counsel of perfection." I rather agree with him. I believe it is the best way in which you can manage this business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01794"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I hope the House will not grudge me a few moments in reply, because a great many criticisms have been passed upon the arguments which I used earlier in the evening. The noble Lord, the Secretary for Scotland says it is undeniable that dissatisfaction exists in Scotland with the present state of matters. I do not think the dissatisfaction is as great as is sometimes represented. But let us, for a moment, say that dissatisfaction does exist. Because there is dissatisfaction with the present state of matters, that is no reasons why you should give a particular change which nobody wants. This gentleman of the name of Elder can be produced as a witness. I am not thoroughly acquainted with the whole of the circumstances, and I am not quite sure I can pass Mr. Elder's Unionist qualifications. I have no doubt he can use as good an argument whatever side of politics he represents. But let us suppose he is in favour of this proposal. Why is Mr. Elder's view to obtain to the disadvantage of the whole of the other agriculturists in Scotland? I am not converted even by hearing that Mr. Elder holds the opinion attributed to him.<lb/>
The point with me is this. I want efficient agricultural administration. I would rather have agricultural administration from a good agricultural Englishman, than I would from the best Scotsman who does not know much about agriculture. It is a disadvantage, no doubt, from my point of view, that he should be an Englishman, but at any rate it is a much greater disadvantage from the point of view of the Scottish agriculturist to have a Scotsman who is not an agriculturist. I hold strongly that the lasting interests of agriculture in Scotland are bound up with keeping the administration solid for the whole of Great Britain. My noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn seemed to think it extraordinary that there was no agricultural influence brought to bear at elections in Scotland. I have no doubt
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0280"/>
<col>551</col>
he was not in the House when I stated earlier in the evening that there are only two counties in Scotland in which the agricultural vote is predominant. In every other constituency the agricultural vote is swamped by other interests. I do not, of course, count the crofting counties as in this sense agricultural. The noble Viscount went on to say that this was a separation from the present Department of Agriculture, that it would not rest there if you had this amount of separation and you might just as well go, as I understood the argument, further at once. My point of view is this, and I want to emphasise it. The separation which would take effect if my Amendment is carried, is, at any rate, only a separation of the Department as between England and Scotland. The separation proposed in the Bill is a complete cutting adrift and having nothing to do with England, except in the matter of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, because I understand that is practically, though not absolutely, conceded by the Secretary for Scotland in his last speech.<lb/>
I put to your Lordships that if you make a completely separate agricultural authority under the Secretary for Scotland it would be much less likely to be content in the future without the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts and much more harm would accrue, than if you have merely a separation and the two Departments remain under allegiance to the President of the Board of Agriculture. As far as I am concerned, I agree with my noble friend Lord Clinton. I cannot understand why this matter is introduced into the Bill at all, and if I had my way I would cut it out altogether. But after looking through the Bill I find it impossible to draft Amendments. If I propose to take out Clause 4 there are other duties connected with the Board of Agriculture which are provided for. No one will contradict this, that if one attempted to leave agricultural matters as they are now, it would be a much more drastic proposal to change the Bill than the one I have proposed. I am afraid I must persevere with my Amendment. Suppose I withdraw it I never can again move it. But suppose I adhere to it and am fortunate to get a majority, some other proposal may come up in some other form, such as that adumbrated by the Secretary for Scotland, and we can judge it on its merits. But the Amendments
<col>552</col>
in the name of the Secretary for Scotland are worse than the Bill itself, because they propose to transfer the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts by a simple Order in Council. Under the Bill the authority of Parliament is allowed, but under this proposal which was put down a day or two ago for the first time we are actually to be transferred by Order in Council without the slightest authority of Parliament at all. In these circumstances I am bound to persevere in my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01795"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to say one word in reference to the last remark of the noble Lord. I think he is rather hard to please, or at least I have not succeeded in meeting his objections. These Amendments were put down to meet some of the proposals made by the noble Lord on Second Reading. The House will recollect what I said in regard to the position of the Government in respect to the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, and we may put that out of the present discussion for a moment. If we put that out, the noble Lord is not correct in saying that it leaves the transfer of other powers to be done by His Majesty in Council without any further reference, because the machinery which has been put clown transfers all the powers of the Board of Agriculture to the new Scottish Board according to the schedule which is stated in the Bill, and the clause to which the noble Lord refers is simply a clause providing for any later adjustment which may not have been foreseen at this moment, any comparatively unimportant consequential adjustment to be carried out by means of an Order by His Majesty in Council. If the noble Lord wishes to put any other safeguard upon that proceeding, there is really no difficulty about it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01796"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt, but Lord Burghclere has apparently shared my mistake because he proposes an Amendment to avoid the difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01797"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: May I say that there is a mistake really as to where Lord Burghclere's Amendment should be moved. I have pointed it out to him, and he agrees to move it in the place which I have indicated. If it were moved in the place where it is on the Paper, it would not have the desired effect.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0281"/>
<col>553</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01798"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Would it not be more convenient to wait until we bet to the Amendment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01799"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I only wish to remove the difficulty which is in the mind of Lord Balfour. The place to move the excision, or rather the refusal to transfer the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, is after the words "Nothing in this section shall transfer or authorise the transfer of any powers or ditties under the Survey Act, 1870." We propose to leave the geological survey with the Board of Agriculture, and it is there that the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts should be placed. My noble friend Lord Burghclere understands that, and therefore I do not think Lord Balfour need dwell upon the point. But may I say that I am profoundly disappointed that the House should be inclined, if it is so inclined, to take the view put forward by Lord Balfour. I have already stated the decision of His Majesty's Government on this point, and I should like to point out further that my noble friend has not put upon the Paper the many consequential Amendments which must necessarily follow the carrying of his Amendment. It will be necessary for me to ask the House to defer proceeding with the Bill to-morrow. We cannot possibly get the Bill into shape because it makes such a radical change throughout the whole construction of the Bill. It would be quite impossible to proceed with the Bill to-morrow if the noble Lord persists in his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01800"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am inclined to think that my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh is justified in the appeal which he made to the House in his concluding remarks. I speak, of course, with the utmost apprehension, both as an Englishman and as a non-agriculturist, but after all one does not require to be either a Scotsman or an agriculturist to follow the main points of this debate. The impression left on my mind by the discussion to-night is, broadly speaking, this. The debate has ranged over two fields, one large and the other small. The larger one was opened by Lord Balfour and traversed with great ability by my noble friend Lord Clinton. The narrower ground was taken up by Lord Burghclere and endorsed by Lord Reay. What has been the attitude of His Majesty's Government with regard to these two
<col>554</col>
scenes of operations? Following upon the powerful speech of Lord Burghclere&#x2014;and I rarely remember a speech in this House delivered with greater fulness of knowledge or greater success of demonstration&#x2014;and the appeal by another noble Lord below the Gangway, the Secretary for Scotland at once indicated a willingness to consider the suggestions put before him. He says that when the Amendment comes on he will not divide against it; he will represent what has happened to his colleagues, and consider whether or not the Bill can be modified to meet the views of the noble Lord.<lb/>
But he metes out different treatment to noble Lords on this side of the House, I listened most attentively to his speech. On many of the aspects of the case I am wholly incompetent to submit an opinion, but on two aspects I am. Lord Balfour of Burleigh repeated over and over again with insistence the proposition that Scottish agricultural opinion is almost unanimously against this Bill. I have heard no answer whatever to that. Lord Pentland did not attempt to contravene it. All he did &#x2014;I wish to be quite just to him&#x2014;was to quote a letter in the <i>Morning Post</i> by a single gentleman, and to say there is some dissatisfaction in Scotland with the existing administration. of agricultural affairs. That is quite a different thing from saying that Scottish opinion favours his proposal; and he did not say anything in his speech to indicate that he has behind him any-weight of agricultural opinion in Scotland in favour of this Bill.<lb/>
The second point which it seems to me Lord Balfour established in his case was this. He argued most powerfully, in the interests of agriculture in Scotland, in favour of administration by a body the head of which should be a Minister at Whitehall instead of a body practically under the orders of the Secretary for Scotland. That was emphasised by the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown. I have heard no reply to that. Is it not fair to ask His Majesty's Government, who are, as we know, about to consider the proposition of Lord Burghclere, to consider also the arguments put forward by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, by Lord Clintion, and by the Earl of Camperdown? In my opinion, my noble friend is entirely justified in asking the House to accept his Amendment. I think we understand perfectly well the attitude of the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0282"/>
<col>555</col>
noble Lord opposite and the form in which the Bill is likely to come back to us. Yet we are not without hope that in the interval the Government may give some consideration to the arguments urged by Lord Balfour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01801"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Earl will be under no misapprehension on this matter. I should like to speak</membercontribution></p>

This Amendment must be taken in connection with another Amendment which follows in my name on the next page, to insert a new clause. I may as well allude to it now; it will save time, because it is consequential. The new clause which I propose reads&#x2014;
<quote>"The Department out of the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund may, if satisfied with the security, advance to any tenant for the purpose of purchasing his holding the whole or any less part of the price of such holding on such terms and conditions as the Department may with the sanction of the Treasury prescribe."</quote>
The object is that the Department may advance money to tenants for the purchase of their holdings. It places no obligation on the Department; if the Department has not got enough money it will say so. The Amendment merely says that it shall not be impossible for the tenant to purchase his holding. This matter has been discussed more than once, and therefore I can deal with it very shortly. The noble Lord says that the occupiers have no desire to buy. How does he know that? If there was even one occupier who desired to buy, why should he not understand that he may at all events apply to get money? The Aberdeenshire Members in the House of Commons say that there is a desire on the part of the tenants to buy. I may also say that the Committee of the late Lord

Onslow recommended that there should be this power of purchase; that at all events it should not be impossible for the tenants to purchase. Why have the Government such a rooted objection to insert the possible power of purchase? It has paid extremely well and has been very much used in Ireland. How do the Government know it will not be used also in Scotland?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01899"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The purpose of my Amendment to Clause 7 is to give an appeal against the decision of the Land Court with regard to questions of compensation where the amount in dispute exceeds &#x00A3;400. This question of there being some appeal seems to me absolutely vital. Just consider what powers are being placed in the hands of the Land Court. It is said that private individuals cannot be safely trusted with the administration of small holdings under &#x00A3;50; yet the Government propose to place the sole management of practically all the small holdings in Scotland under the Land Court, and that without any appeal of any sort or kind.<lb/>
I must ask your Lordships to look at subsection (11) of this clause. First the Land Court are to make an order in regard to the land. Then by this subsection they are thereafter to determine and by order declare, first, in respect of what land, if any, specified in the scheme, one or more holdings for new holders may respectively be constituted, and up to what date the power to constitute them otherwise than by agreement may be exercised; secondly, what is the fair rent for each new holding; thirdly, what land, if any, specified in the scheme is to be excluded therefrom; and, fourthly, whatever else may be necessary for the purpose of making the scheme effective and of adjusting the rights of all parties interested in or affected by the proceedings.<lb/> Now those are powers such as have never been given, so far as I know, to any Land Court in the world. But the clause proceeds&#x2014;and this is what I wish to call attention to&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that where the Land Court are of opinion that damage or injury will be done to the letting value of the land to be occupied by a new holder or new holders, or of any farm of which
<col>564</col>
such land forms part, or to any tenant in respect that the land forms part or the whole of his tenancy or to any landlord either in respect of an obligation to take over sheep stock at a valuation or in respect of any depreciation in the value of the estate of which the land forms part in consequence of and directly attributable to the constitution of the new holding or holdings as proposed, they shall require the Board, in the event of the scheme being proceeded with, to pay compensation to such amount as the Land Court determine after giving parties an opportunity of being heard and, if they so desire, of leading evidence in the matter."</quote>
Take the words "where the Land Court are of opinion that damage or injury will be done." Suppose they say, "We do not think any damage or injury is done." There is no question then of any compensation to any of these persons, however much they may consider that damage or injury has been done; there is no appeal of any kind or sort against the Land Court. Then we come to the words which deal with compensation. "They shall require the Board, in the event of the scheme being proceeded with, to pay compensation to such amount as the Land Court determine."<lb/>
First, the Land Court are to determine whether any damage or injury has been done, and, secondly, the amount of the compensation. Just think of the cases of damage which may arise out of this. Take the case of an application to take over sheep stock at a valuation which may run into thousands of pounds. Take the case of their establishing some crofters in an important part of a deer forest. That might depreciate the value of the estate of which the land forms a part, and yet if they do not choose to give compensation no compensation whatever is to be given. I do not think any one will maintain that it can be right to give five men, of whom, so we are told, one only is to be a lawyer, this enormous power without any appeal of any kind whatsoever.<lb/>
I think it was stated in the other House that this would be a very important Court and sure to be fair. It will depend very much upon who are the persons placed on this Court. But, even if they were the most perfect men in the world, surely in cases where considerable damage is alleged to be done it cannot be right that there should be no appeal. I venture to hope that an appeal of some sort will be given by Parliament; for if an appeal is refused then no Bill that you could produce hereafter could possibly be more unjust than this Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0287"/>
<col>565</col>
In my Amendment I have suggested an appeal to the Court of Session. In another place it was suggested that it should be to the Judges of the Valuation Appeal Court; but that was objected to on the ground that the appeal would then be from a higher Court to a Court of less authority, to a lower Court consisting of three Valuation Judges. I should have formed exactly the reverse opinion; but, that, after all, is only my view. It may be said that some delay may occur in settling these questions. I hope that very little will occur, but, even if some delay did occur, in matters of large pecuniary importance a little delay is preferable to manifest injustice. It is for that reason that I venture to place this Amendment before your Lordships. You will see that under the Bill as it is the Land Court is both judge and jury. There is no appeal of any kind, and I cannot imagine any more despotic authority.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01909"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That is so. How are such points decided as to compensation, points which are commonly remitted to an arbiter? Almost invariably by the arbiter, whose judgment is final. So inasmuch as we are substituting a Court of Arbitration, it is not fairly to be described as a new departure when we place the decisions of this Court in the same position as the decisions of an arbiter&#x2014;namely, that they are final. The noble Earl suggests an appeal from the Land Court on the familiar ground that they are judge and jury in their own case. I do submit that that shows a complete misapprehension of the true position of the Land Court in this scheme. It has no power whatever in the Bill to initiate proposals for the creation of small holdings. It has no responsibility whatever for the success or the failure of any proposal or any scheme for the constitution of small holdings. That power of initiation and that responsibility lie, not with the Land Court, but with the Board or with the Department of Agriculture, as Lord Balfour's Amendment has now changed it. The functions of the Land Court are judicial. After hearing the parties it is their duty to decide between the parties. They have no concern in the cost of the scheme, or whether it shall be economical or extravagant. They have no more interest than the Court of Session itself whether a large or small amount of money is spent on these schemes, but from their special constitution they ought to be more competent than any other Court to give right awards in these transactions.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0288"/>
<col>567</col>
There are four obvious disadvantages in the proposal of the noble Earl. In the first place there is delay. The procedure under Clause 7 for the creation of small holdings is most careful and deliberate. Stage after stage is to take place. There is the official ascertainment, of the demand for land, and tenants willing to take up holdings to promote the scheme are to be submitted to the Board, and the Board is to decide what compensation they can offer. They then have to ask the landlord whether he is willing that such a scheme shall be inaugurated. If he is, it goes on to the Land Court to fix the rent; if he is not willing the whole scheme is to be reheard and both parties appear at the public inquiry, and only then does the Land Court come in. Necessarily, weeks and months must elapse at the very least before such schemes can be carefully promoted and finally completed, and on the top of all this you are going to impose the inevitable delay of an appeal.<lb/>
Then there is the expense. I would ask your Lordships to consider what it means. In the first place all the evidence will have to be recorded at length and in full. It will have to be printed on the productions, as they are called in Scottish Courts, printed and prepared for the Appeal Court. Over all the procedure of the Land Court itself will be present this possibility of an appeal. All its arrangements will be much more elaborate, much more costly, much more formal. But the delay and the expense are the least part of the mischief which this change in the Bill would do. The change&#x2014;and this is my third objection to it&#x2014;will inevitably alter the whole character of the procedure before the Land Court. Except in the consideration of evidence the Land Court would not be able to rely upon these very expert members whom you are anxious shall form this Court. They will have to decide on the recorded evidence, because the Appeal Court can only decide on the recorded evidence. The first result of that will be that both parties to a case before the Land Court will have to produce expert witnesses, a form of evidence which is not, perhaps, the most satisfactory&#x2014;certainly it is the most expensive. Your Land Court would be utterly changed in character, and, as I say, the judgment of your own expert members of that Court would not be fully utilised.<lb/>
<col>568</col>
Then, fourthly, let me put this to your Lordships. The noble Earl objected to a phrase which was used that such a proposal as his would be an appeal from a higher Court to a lower Court. In one sense that is absolutely true, because it would be from a more competent Court to a less competent Court. Your Land Court is to be composed of skilled agriculturists, valuers, people acquainted with such subjects as what a fair rent should be and what compensation there should be for taking this or that bit of land. If these points go to the Court of Session they must be decided on the recorded evidence, because we must take it that Judges do not have ordinarily the experience of trained agriculturists or trained land valuers. So that in that sense it is perfectly true that this appeal will be from an expert Court to an inexpert Court. That is the substance of my fourth objection to this proposal. I would earnestly beg your Lordships to consider what the very serious effect of this proposal will be on the whole character of the procedure before the Court which is set up by the Bill&#x2014;not only delay, not only expense, but the fact that you will not be utilising to the full the very Court which we are all anxious to set up to carry out the provisions of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PUBLIC ROADS (IRELAND) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01938">Order of the Day for receiving the Report of Amendments, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01939">Moved, That this Report be now received.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Charnwood.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01940"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this stage I should like to make a few observations on a point raised in Committee by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, who I regret is unable to be in his place to-day. But let me first clear up a smaller point which was raised by Lord Ashbourne in Committee. He asked the noble Lord in charge of the Bill whether the Bill had been before a Committee, and Lord Charnwood said it had been before a Select Committee. In giving that answer the noble Lord made a slip. It was not a Select Committee, but a Grand Committee. I sent the noble and learned Lord a copy of the proceedings, and I hope it has given him the information he desired. The noble and learned Lord seemed to think that the Bill had not been discussed in the House of Commons, and I think that view was shared by other noble Lords. As a matter of fact, this Bill has been two years before Parliament. It was in Committee in the House of Commons last year, when it was extensively amended at the instance of the Irish Local Government Board. It was in Committee in the other House again this year, and was again subjected to amendment. The Bill is generally supported by both sections of opinion in Ireland, and no protest has been received from any official source with regard to it. It has the advantage, therefore, of being non-controversial, and it is an attempt to assimilate the law in Ireland to the law in this country.<lb/>
With regard to Lord Lansdowne's point, the noble Marquess asked how far this Bill had any application to what is known as light motor vehicles. The Bill does apply to them in so far as Clause 1 is concerned, where expenses are incurred as the result of extraordinary traffic. There the county council or borough council are empowered to recover such expenses from the owner of the motor car; and there is a further provision, which I think is an important one, which allows for a composition to be entered into between the county council and owners of motor cars. But what the Bill does not provide is any regulation as to the width of motor car tyres, though
<col>572</col>
I submit that this Bill is a great advance on the state of the law in Ireland at present. There is nothing but the Act of 1865 which governs this question, and it is doubtful whether a county council has any right except at Common Law, which perhaps is not worth a great deal, to recover if damage is done to roads as the result of extraordinary traffic. I think we may claim that this Bill affords fair protection to the ratepayers without throwing unduly onerous burdens on the owners of this traffic.<lb/>
But the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition was not satisfied. He wished to go a step further, and suggested that an Amendment should be inserted to regulate the width of motor car tyres. Probably the noble Marquess was thinking of what he has doubtless experienced in the county of Kerry, where there is an extensive tourist trade at the present time, and where undoubtedly great damage has been done to many of the roads, and this condition of affairs prevails elsewhere. If we were to adopt the noble Marquess's suggestion and regulate the width of motor tyres, the first result would be to introduce a controversial matter into the Bill. There is a view held by some noble Lords that as a matter of fact already this Bill places a rather unfair burden on motor traffic. But in that connection I would say that in Ireland a great many of the roads that we are considering are merely farmers' roads, and it seems hard that tourists who travel over them and spoil the roads should throw the expense of repairing them on the farming class who derive no benefit from the tourist trade. And there is this further point, that the making of roads in Ireland presents engineering difficulties. To make a really good road across a bog, which is often involved, would necessitate considerable expense. There is another objection to proceeding in the way the noble Marquess desired, and that is that anything which would have the effect of regulating the width of motor tyres would have to be the subject of very careful consideration. We should have to decide what weight and what width were the best to take, so as to protect roads without practically prohibiting the use of motor traffic altogether.<lb/>
Apart from that, I do not think the noble Marquess's Amendment is needed, because there is already a power under the Motor Car Act of 1896 which enables the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0291"/>
<col>573</col>
Local Government Board to make regulations with regard to the breadth of motor tyres. The clause runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The Local Government Board may make regulations with respect to the use of light locomotives on highways and their construction"&#x2014;</quote>
which, of course, covers the question of the width of tyres&#x2014;
<quote>"and the conditions under which they may be used";</quote>
and there is a subsection which enables the Local Government Board to limit the application of these regulations; so that it is clear that they have power, if representations were made to them and appeared to be properly substantiated, to regulate the kind of traffic that should go over any particular road. Indeed, the Local Government Board have already made regulations with regard to heavy motors, and I have no doubt whatever that they would be willing and able to make regulations with regard to light motors, as they are called, in a similar manner. In these circumstances we feel that the Bill holds a fair balance between the ratepayers and motorists generally. It is, as I have said, an advance upon the present state of the law in Ireland; it has the advantage of being non-controversial, and therefore the Government would not feel inclined to suggest to the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that he should amend it in the manner suggested by the noble Marquess, and I hope your Lordships may concur in that view.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SMALL LANDHOLDERS (SCOTLAND) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01949">House again in Committee (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01950">Debate resumed on the Amendment moved by the Earl of Camperdown to add, at the end of subsection (11) of Clause 7, the following proviso&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided always that it shall be competent for any person aggrieved by the determination of the Land Court, if the amount in dispute exceeds four hundred pounds, to require the Land Court to state and sign the case upon which the question arose, setting forth the evidence, together with the determination thereon, and to transmit such case for the decision of either division of the Court of Session, subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by Act of Sederunt, and such decision shall be final."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01951"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment which was moved by my noble friend Lord Camperdown just before the adjournment last night is one which I think your Lordships will agree is drawn in a spirit of the strictest moderation, so moderate, indeed, that I am certain it will not meet with the approval of many of the extremer critics of this Bill. We have shown during the course of the Second Reading, at all events, that we dislike the setting up of the Land Court altogether, and nothing has happened since that time to make us change our views; but we have to recognise that in supporting this Amendment we are accepting the principle of a Land Court as applied to existing small tenants and qualified leaseholders and other tenants who come under the usual provisions of the Crofter Act, subject to the appeal for which we are now asking. I should like to make my own position clear upon this matter, because while I feel bound to accept the Land Court subject to this appeal, it is only so far as these particular tenants who come under the crofter system are concerned and does not apply to those tenants who are in an entirely different position and who come under Section 32 of the Bill, and with regard to whom there is an Amendment standing in my name on the Paper.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, in opposing last night any appeal from the Land Court, reminded us that we should be appealing from, I think he said, an expert Court to probably an inexpert Court. He told us that the duties winch this Land Court would have chiefly to do would be confined, to some extent at all events, to assessing compensation and valuing and fixing rents&#x2014;all matters which are usually
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0292"/>
<col>575</col>
submitted to a final arbitration. Arbitration, of course, is what we would like to have in this case. We make no secret of it. Although the Land Court in itself may be considered an arbiter, yet there is this very essential difference from what we would prefer, that neither party to the dispute has any voice in the composition of the Court. At the present moment we have no knowledge at all of how the Court is to be composed, and we do fear that under the provisions of this Bill we at all events will not be able to look upon the Court as necessarily an impartial body. I think the position in the Bill forbids our doing so. The Court is too closely connected with the creation of small holdings, and it seems that it can only justify its existence by the number of small holdings which are created.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Camperdown spoke of this Court as being both judge and jury, and the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland objected to that construction. He said that it was a misapprehension of the powers of the Court, and that the Court itself had nothing to do with the promotion of small holdings. That is, of course, perfectly correct. The actual promotion is done by the Commissioner for Small Holdings or by the Board. They have to bring a scheme into force by agreement, if they can, but failing agreement they have to apply to the Court, and the whole of the rest of the powers are left in the hands of the Court. The fixing of a fair rent, the fixing of terms and conditions, the assessment of damages and compensation to the outgoing tenant&#x2014;all those matters are in the hands of the Land Court. The decision which they come to over these matters will be of enormous importance both to the owner and to the occupier. But more than that, supposing they think it necessary to assess a large amount of compensation to be payable to an outgoing tenant, the fact of the compensation being so much may actually prevent the scheme coming into force. Is not that an actual inducement to them to keep the compensation down to the lowest possible amount? The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland shakes his head, but may I put it in this way? If the amount to be paid to an outgoing tenant for damages or loss is so large that the interest on that sum added to the amount which must be put on the small holder is beyond the amount which the small holder can pay, would not that prevent the holding being let off to small tenants?
<col>576</col>
I admit I am speaking in the dark. I do not understand the finances of the Bill. It may be that by a system of loans and gifts the noble Lord may be able to pay off the largo holders and yet let the small holders live at a reasonable figure; but if it is to be worked as an economic proposition he cannot do so. I think I am not wrong in saying that if the compensation is assessed at a large figure the rent must be fixed for the new holder at a figure at which he probably cannot live, and that must make it difficult for the scheme of small holdings to be carried out. We think that this is placing an enormous power in the hands of a body purely autocratic in its nature and of whose composition we know nothing. But there is satisfaction in hearing from the noble Lord that this body, or at all events part of it, is to be selected for its knowledge of agriculture and valuation. That may satisfy us to seine extent of its competency. I think he told us that four members of the Court were to be appointed without any regard to politics. That, I am afraid, means that the fifth is to be appointed with regard to politics.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01952"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Lord is justified in that inference. The chairman of the Land Court will be a judicial officer, and will be appointed for his suitability for that position, his knowledge of law, his eminence in the profession, and so forth. The remaining four will be appointed from such persons as I described yesterday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01953"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: Then the chairman of the Land Court is to have no politics? But I will not pursue that point. We are really being asked to accept a body to decide cases of enormous importance to us actually blindfold, and without knowing whether they will be in a position to settle the matters that will come before them in a manner which we can consider fair. You are really asking us to take too great a risk considering the great issues which are at stake; and in supporting this Amendment of my noble friend I do so solely because it does appear to me to be some sort of middle course between what is proposed by the Government and what we would have liked to see adopted ourselves. In the hope of coming to terms with the Government in this matter I ant glad to support the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0293"/>
<col>577</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01954"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: I confess I was somewhat astonished last night to hear the Secretary for Scotland inform us that there was already a Court of Appeal in this Bill in the 5th subsection of Clause 25. As I read that clause it does not constitute a Court of Appeal. It states that the Land Court may delegate any of the powers conferred upon it to one of its number. Therefore any single member of the Land Court, if the power had been delegated to him by the rest of the body, could settle whether a scheme was to go through, the amount of land to be taken, the fair rent to be fixed, and the compensation, if any, to be paid to the landlord and the tenant from whom the land was taken. Then there is an appeal from that single person, to whom this power is delegated, to himself with two other members of the Court, to whom probably similar powers have been delegated with regard to other estates, and on whose decisions he will have in turn to sit in review. So, therefore, this appeal is really from the one Commissioner who has decided this matter to himself and two of his colleagues who had been doing the same in other cases. It seems to me that this will be less a Court of Appeal than a mutual admiration society.<lb/>
And then remember that every one of these gentlemen is liable to be removed at any moment by the Secretary for Scotland on the ground of inability. Now what is the meaning of the word inability? It may mean inability to carry out the provisions of the Bill to supply small holdings to tenants in Scotland, and the reason they may be unable to do so may be because they give so much compensation to landlords that it would be impossible to finance the schemes. The noble Lord told us last night that at the present time it did not pay landlords or tenants to create small holdings. The economic value of these holdings is not going to be changed by this Bill. The Bill is going to create them so that it will be to the advantage of small holders to hold them. Therefore, there must be a loss to be borne by the landowners or by the State, and it is because we suspect that this Bill when it comes to be worked will result in a loss to the landlord and not to the State that we are pressing so earnestly to have a Court which shall be an impartial Court, and which shall judge on the evidence before it what is the value of the land
<col>578</col>
taken and the loss suffered by the landlord or tenant from whom the land is taken.<lb/>
We have suffered greatly in Ireland from expert views as to the value of land. A late Chief Commissioner gave evidence before a Royal Commission on this point, and he said that the value of land was not the value which it had to the landlord and was not fixed in consideration of the rent which he might have received from it. He stated that the land might be worth &#x00A3;2 a year to the landlord, but for the purpose for which he (one of the Chief Commissioners) required it it might only be worth &#x00A3;1 a year, and he said it was on that basis that a landlord ought to be compensated. He gave further evidence of the way in which his views were influenced, because he said he thought it probable that in a short space of time the restrictions on the importation of foreign cattle would be removed, and that therefore land and stock would fall in value. It is possible that some of these gentlemen who may be appointed members of the Land Court may hold similar views, and it is because we wish the compensation to be given to be on the basis of the value which the land is worth at the present time and has been worth for many years, and not on speculative ideas of what the future value of the land may be, that we press for an appeal in these cases. My noble friend has confined the appeal to cases where the amount of compensation is over &#x00A3;400. Personally I am sorry that this is the case, though I quite understand the reason which prompted him to do so. It was, I understand, to enable cases where the amount of compensation is small to be settled quickly and not to put litigants to much expense; but if cases above &#x00A3;400 are to go to a High Court, I hope that the decisions which they come to will influence the decisions which will be come to by the inferior Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01955"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: This particular Amendment raises a much wider question than that which is applicable to this particular Bill. Not for the first time there is a disposition on the part of His Majesty's Government to distrust the Judges, and instead of trusting to the ordinary Courts of Law to set up Courts of their own in sonic form or another which shall be subject to the particular authority which may be in office at the time. That is a very dangerous principle, and one
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0294"/>
<col>579</col>
which I hope your Lordships will resist. During the whole troubled period of the Revolution and the legislation which followed it, over and over again the statement was made in Parliament that the liberties of the people were dependent upon the maintenance of the law as it was, that there should not be any new Courts created, and that the Judges should hold their office <i>quandiu se bene gesserint</i>. That gave them a freehold in their office and made them independent of the Crown, and to my mind that is one of the most important things one should take care should not be nibbled away by little amendments and little Courts.<lb/>
I do not think the importance of this Amendment, or, indeed, of any other Amendment, will be adequately understood unless one looks at what the constitution of the proposed Court is. I am glad that nobody knows who the members of the Court are to be, because whatever I say on the subject cannot therefore be supposed to be any reflection upon individuals, but upon a system which appoints such persons as are dismissible at the will of the Secretary for Scotland. I believe that is absolutely unknown to our system ever since the Revolution. But it is in terms laid down in this Bill that the Secretary for Scotland may dismiss persons comprising the Land Court. I suppose the persons who devised this Bill thought that they must in some way or another put in some check upon that, and I observe that the dismissal with its causes is to be laid on the Table of Parliament for a certain number of days. But that is not the same thing. What you want is the independence of the Judge, and if you do not insist upon the independence of the Judge I believe you will relapse into a very loose practice indeed.<lb/>
With regard to the point we are discussing, I suspect that the person who drew up this provision had a notion that by repeating the same thing in different words he would cause greater security. Let me read to the House what the appeal is as it stands. Subsection (2) of Clause 25 recites that this new Land Court&#x2014;
<quote>"shall have full power and jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters, whether of law or fact, and no other Court shall review the orders or determinations of the Land Court, subject always to thy provisions of Section 7 of this Act; Provided that the Land Court may"&#x2014;</quote>
<col>580</col>
observe the mode in which the Land Court is compellable to have an appeal of any sort, law or fact&#x2014;
<quote>"if they think fit"&#x2014;</quote>
those are the cardinal words; they exist in other circumstances in other places, and according to my experience where that jurisdiction is given every weak Judge "thinks fit" in many cases when he ought not to think fit&#x2014;
<quote>"if they think fit, and shall on the request of any party unless they consider that such request is frivolous or vexatious, state a special case &#x2026;"</quote>
Then it may go to either division of the Court of Session.<lb/>
Now why should the appeal not go to the Court of Session? What is the magic about this particular question which renders it necessary to have a special Court to itself? I think my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will confirm me when I say that Courts of Law have every conceivable question that could possibly be raised come before them; they are compelled to determine them, and I have never heard that there has been any objection to their ultimate determination. What is the reason why this particular thing should be done in Scotland? I said just now that all through the period of the Revolution there was over and over again the affirmation of the necessity of the independence of the Judges. Let me read the concluding language of the 12th and 13th William III&#x2014;it is very remarkable. In the first place the Statute begins by saying that the Judges' Commissions shall be made <i>quandiu se bene gesserint</i>, and then it goes on to say this&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas the laws of England are the birthright of the people thereof and all the Kings and Queens who shall ascend the Throne of this Realm ought to administer the government of the same according to the said laws, and all their officers and ministers ought to serve them respectively according to the same. The said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons do therefore further humbly pray that all the laws and statutes of this Realm for securing the established religion and the rights and liberties of the people thereof and all other laws and statutes of the same now in force may be ratified and confirmed, and the same &#x2026; are ratified and confirmed accordingly."</quote>
This is one of the Statutes which was at that time establishing a new Constitution, and one of the things continually referred to was the independence of the Judges. As I dare say your Lordships will remember, the demise of the Crown was supposed to put an end to the Commission
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0295"/>
<col>581</col>
of the Judges, whereupon by the 1st George III that was amended. And this is no old musty sort of law that one is dealing with. When this House was established as a Court of Appeal it was still felt necessary that the independence of the Judges should be likewise confirmed.<lb/>
The example in this Bill is one which has been set for the first time. I think, in forming a Court of this sort. It is one of the things I am sorry for that we should have to affirm such a Court at all, but I am unwilling to move the rejection of the Court because it seems to me there is something in the nature of an agreement between the parties. But certainly I should think no Scotsman would be contented to have a Court of this character without the guarantee of the independence of the Court and without an appeal to the ordinary Courts of Justice. Let me say also&#x2014;and here again I am sure my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will confirm me&#x2014;that no one could be more accurate or skilful than those learned persons who come before us from Scotland to argue appeals. The judgments of the Scottish Courts themselves exhibit the great care with which justice is done in Scotland, and I believe an attempt of this sort to set up a rival Court simply because you are dealing with a different subject would be most mischievous. For that reason I most heartily support my noble friend's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01956"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: I most, certainly, with national pride, confirm what the noble and learned Earl has said in regard to the great capacity which is shown at the Bar by my countrymen who come here to argue cases. I do not think there are ever cases argued better than by them, and the Court of Session in Scotland deservedly holds the highest reputation. I have particular pleasure in confirming that statement of the noble and learned Earl. I also agree that nothing could be more important or sacred in this country than to maintain the independence of the Judicial Bench&#x2014;their irremovability except for misconduct. Anybody who reads, and reads with shame, the history of former times, both English and Scottish history, knows what fearful wrong was inflicted upon the community when you had removable Judges, and I believe that few greater calamities could happen to this country
<col>582</col>
than that any retrograde step should be taken in that respect, departing from the principles laid down upwards of 200 years ago. I agree to the full with all that, and if we were dealing with a question of the independence of the Judges I should make no criticism at all.<lb/>
But in this Bill you are not setting up a Court of Law. I do not underrate the importance of the ditties that have to be discharged; but you are not dealing with the liberty of the subject, you are not dealing with those vital questions affecting the freedom and the stability of our institutions. You are dealing with nothing more nor less than how much is to be paid in money as compensation for land and the severance of land, or compensation by reason of a tenant, vacating land and the landlord suffering in consequence. II think the noble and learned Earl will agree that that is, roughly speaking, the subject matter. There is nothing for this tribunal to do in the way of executive functions. The noble and learned Earl is completely in error, if he will allow me respectfully to say so, in thinking that there are executive functions attaching to this Court. The Executive (the Board) and the Judiciary (the Court) are jealously separated in their functions, as I said five years ago ought to be the ease in my opinion. There is nothing but valuation to be done by this Court.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01958"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: That I call valuation. I include it in the wider sense. What is the value of land per year? I say that is valuation. I do not think it is always an easy thing to decide. I should be quite incompetent to decide it myself. At the same time it is a pure assessment in money of a particular thing&#x2014;namely, land to be enjoyed year by year. These gentlemen may be removed only for inability or misbehaviour, but no such order is to come into operation until it has lain on the Table of both Houses of Parliament for not less than thirty days, and it is not to be operative if either House passes a Resolution objecting to it. I think that is giving a very fair measure of security. The County Court Judges and the Sheriffs in this country do not enjoy such security. In fact, only the High

If you think that is not sufficiently stiff; if you think that means&#x2014;are we not getting a little into a suspicious humour?&#x2014;the evading of what is intended, namely, that points of law shall be raised before the Court of Session if they are really points of law, then move an Amendment making it clear. We shall not raise any difficulties about it. We need not deal with words. If these words are not
<col>584</col>
sufficient to do in substance what we want to do, let us consider the question when we come to it and put in better words in their place. I pass from that.<lb/>
Then it is only on questions of fact that the decision of the Land Court is final. Similar questions of fact have to be determined under the English Small Holdings Act. Those are determined by one valuer appointed by the President of the Board of Agriculture, removable by the President of the Board of Agriculture, and his decision is final. Why may you do all these things in England, and when we in Scotland say, "We will have four valuators and a high judicial officer on the top and give an appeal to all of them sitting together," why are we to be severely criticised? Are we not doing quite as much in the way of fair play as was done for England, which has worked without a single complaint I believe being made since the year 1906? That is the first observation. The second is this. The debate has been carried on as if there never had been any system of arbitration or valuation by valuators in this country. Why, my Lords, ever since the year 1845 under the Lands Clauses Act and the Railway Clauses Act there have been numberless arbitrations, involving sums of anything up to half a million or more and down to sums of as little as &#x00A3;100 or less, which have been systematically and constantly dealt with by single arbitrators.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01965"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: And by the Courts, too.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01966"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: If you please; sometimes by the selection of the parties and sometimes by the appointment of a Judge or other authority or by juries on questions of fact, and there has been no complaint, unless indeed it be a complaint that they have been rather liberal and generous in their awards, a charge which I do not think is really well founded. The system of valuation by arbiters has been so well established that no one who has been in practice at the Bar has not appeared many times before them. I am sure the noble and learned Earl has appeared hundreds or thousands of times before these tribunals assessing the value of land large or small in amount. The practice is to get skilled persons for valuing the land whenever the occasion for valuing land arises.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0297"/>
<col>585</col>
Now it is proposed in the Amendment that if the sum of money amounts to &#x00A3;400, you shall be entitled to go to the Court of Session in order to determine the value of particular pieces of land. Let us look at the questions which might thus come before the Court of Session on appeal. There may be a decision that damage or injury will be done to the letting value of the land. That is to be decided by three Judges. There may be a question of depreciation in the value of the estate of which the land to be occupied by a new holder forms part, or a question of the value of two or three or four or five or fifty acres of land. Do you think that the Court of Session or His Majesty's Judges either in England or in Scotland have any knowledge at all of the value of land? I enrol myself in that battalion of whom the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, spoke when he said he was not an agriculturist. I am not an agriculturist. There is probably not a farm manager or agent, even perhaps not a labourer, in Sussex who would not be better able to value a piece of land than I should myself. I should have to judge according to the evidence. But if you ask for knowledge and experience and particular information, you are going to a set of men who are the least capable of their own knowledge to contribute anything to the solution of the problem as to what is the value of land or the depreciation of property. It would have to be taken entirely on evidence. There is not one out of ten of the Judges of this country or of Scotland who specially know anything about the value of land or agriculture or farming.<lb/>
Under this Bill there is to be an experienced judicial officer with some knowledge of the law and at the same time a knowledge of the value of land, with four men to assist him who will be honestly chosen. If you are to assume that they will be dishonestly chosen, you had better throw out the Bill at once. It would be a fraud both upon Parliament and on the country. To whom are you proposing in this Amendment to make the appeal on the question of the value of fifty acres of land from these four experts, competent and experienced, and knowing all about it, with at their head a Judge or Sheriff or whatever you please to call him? To three Judges of the Court of Session who admittedly in most cases do not know anything whatever about the value of
<col>586</col>
land. If it is a question of law, if it is a question of principle, I could understand it thoroughly; but when the whole question is, "Here are fifty acres of land, how much money is to be paid for it?" in what way do you imagine that the learned Judges in the Court of Session are to be inspired for the occasion in order to be able to overrule the experienced opinion of these four gentlemen? If I were either a landlord or a tenant&#x2014;I am neither one nor the other&#x2014;I should shudder at the idea of the opinion of these experienced men being overruled by three Judges of the Court of Session, who decide questions one clay relating to a charter party, the next day relating to a will, and the day after that relating to a mine, and so forth. Their want of knowledge is a disadvantage, but that is not the only disadvantage. They have to decide on evidence. Here is the Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, which says that tie Land Court is to state and sign the case on which a question arises&#x2014;that is, the question of what the value is of the fifty acres&#x2014;setting forth the evidence together with the determination thereon. Therefore these unhappy Judges in the Court of Session are not to decide by going down to look at the place themselves, which the valuators may do, but they are to get it all on paper. They are not to see the witnesses; and everybody knows that the countenance and demeanour of a witness are a better sign and token of his credibility than anything he may say. They are not to see the witnesses, but to have a long roll of paper with question and answer, which imparts to them absolutely nothing except the words printed upon it. With that information alone they are to overrule on a point of value the decision of these four men. I think the noble and learned Earl himself was sitting in one case when we had to discuss, only within the last fortnight, the disadvantages under which we laboured in this House through not seeing and hearing the witnesses themselves. In that case the Court of Session had laboured under the same disadvantage; they had not had an opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses and judging of their testimony with regard to a question of fact, and for that reason we overruled the decision of the Court of Session and restored that of the Lord Ordinary, because he had had the advantage of hearing the witnesses and observing their demeanour when giving their evidence.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0298"/>
<col>587</col>
What will be the result if the Amendment is accepted? The Court of Session will have to act upon expert evidence. It is quite impossible, as I have said, for them to act upon their own knowledge. They will not be able to form a general opinion to be corrected by others merely. They will have to rely wholly and exclusively upon this written roll of evidence by experts without even having the advantage of hearing and seeing them. I forbear from saying what I might say about expert witnesses. We all know the famous story of a Judge in this country when defining what was a liar. He said there were three classes of liars, and illustrated them by the positive, the comparative, and the superlative, the first being the liar, the second being the liar with the addition of an expletive, and the third being&#x2014;well, I will not say which was the superlative. You will have to employ these professional witnesses in order to inform the ignorant Judges of the Court of Session adequately, and it will not only be most expensive but most unreliable. There is only one thing you can be certain about, and that is that they will contradict one another.<lb/>
I have endeavoured to put what I submit is the view of fair play to the noble Earl. He cannot wish that the landlords and the tenants should be smothered in expenses; he cannot wish that the appeal should be from the competent to the incompetent. What I believe is at the bottom of his Amendment is this: he is afraid that fair appointments will not be made. I do not seek to make any declaration of it, but I know quite well that my noble friend Lord Pentland is certain to try at least to make fair and good appointments. But is not this an astonishing thing, that while you do not trust a tribunal consisting of a Judge and four valuators in, a Scottish Bill, you are quite prepared to accept in an English Bill one valuator appointed by the Board of Agriculture? What have we done in Scotland to justify such an invidious discrimination? Are we less honest or less reliable than other people? I say it is a very unfair thing to refuse that confidence to the Scottish valuators and to the Scottish Secretary which you accorded five years ago to the English valuator and to the English head of the Department. We are just as honest as you are, and you may depend upon it that our appointments will be made as honestly.</membercontribution></p>

I say it is not fair play. I appeal to the noble Earl whether, unintentionally and unwittingly, he is not refusing us fair play. I do not think he would wish to do it, certainly not to Scotland, being a distinguished Scotsman himself. I trust this Bill will realise the hopes that have been created with regard to it. I believe it will go a long way, but Scotland is in a difficult position. Your Lordships are well aware how emigration is going on and the difficulties we have to encounter in that country.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01975"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I did not say what was preferable. Now we must get on to the question of why it is preferable. My noble friend Lord Clinton hit the nail on the head this evening when he said, "We object to this Land Court for the purposes to which you propose to put it." We have gone so far as this, that we have allowed this Land Court to pass even with regard to such questions as rent, and so on, and it is only on this question of compensation that we say we are not ready to give them full power to do whatever they like. Let the noble and learned Earl call to mind that he is going to give to this Court absolute power&#x2014;to put it in general language&#x2014;with regard to all holdings under &#x00A3;50 in Scotland, absolute power with regard to new holdings, and very large powers with regard to existing holdings. Even that we have allowed to pass so far, but what we say is that on this question of compensation we are not prepared to place unlimited confidence in this Court. In the first place one of the members&#x2014;we do not know who he is&#x2014;is to be a lawyer. Who are to be the other four? They are to be experts, and we heard from the noble and learned Earl just now what his opinion of experts was.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01976"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I said expert witnesses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01977"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Earl quoted somebody else, and he did not say he disagreed. He asks us to place in the hands or these four experts and this lawyer a power which is to be equal to that of the Court of Session or of this House. The noble and learned Earl said, "Why go to the Judges; can
<col>590</col>
the Judges form any opinion as to the value of land?" I have every confidence in His Majesty's Judges, certainly in the noble and learned Earl himself. If he had evidence placed before him I would much rather take his opinion than that of any expert and all the members of this Land Court put together. He said, "If I were a landlord or a tenant&#x2014;but I am neither one nor the other&#x2014;I should shudder at the idea of appealing to the Court of Session from this Land Court." That is just it. The noble and learned Earl is neither a landlord nor a tenant. He has no notion of what their opinions or feelings are with regard to these matters. I am sure that all landlords, and I believe all tenants, infinitely prefer the Court of Session as a final appeal to being placed in the hands of this Land Court without any appeal. I am sorry I cannot agree with the noble and learned Earl that the functions of the Land Court will be purely with regard to valuation. They go very much further. But, after all, that is a point which has been dealt with before, and I will not trouble your Lordships further with it.<lb/>
The Secretary for Scotland said the other night that if you go past this Land Court your experts will not be fully utilised. What that meant I do not know, except that it meant that you will not get out of them 20<i>s</i>. in the &#x00A3; in work for the amount of salary you give them. As to the value of their opinion, experts ought not to be Judges; they ought to be witnesses. That is the purpose for which they are always brought before the Court, and it is the exact difference between an expert witness and a Judge that makes me prefer a Judge to an expert. Without speaking in any disrespectful manner of those who are going to be placed on this Court, they are experts, and, remember, they are all appointed by the Secretary for Scotland, and, as has been pointed out, they are all removable by the Secretary for Scotland. As for calling them an independent Court in the same way as your Lordships' Appeal Court or the Court of Session is an independent Court, that is really very much the same as saying that a horse chestnut is a chestnut horse.<lb/>
Now take this proviso. The noble and learned Earl said that he was not himself able to appreciate some of the difficulties of these questions. He said, if I remember aright, that after all it could only be the question of what was the value of a holding
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0300"/>
<col>591</col>
of &#x00A3;50 cut out of a farm. The proviso says&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that where the Land Court are of opinion that damage or injury will be done to the letting value of the land to be occupied by a new holder or new holders, or of any farm of which such land forms part, or to any tenant in respect that the land forms part or the whole of his tenancy &#x2026;"</quote>
Allow me to observe that it is a very important question to a tenant when a bit is cut out of his holding. His whole equipment, his whole stock, the number of those whom he employs, his whole business depends on, and is in proportion to, the size of his tenancy, and it is not such a simple matter, I can assure the noble and learned Earl, as he seems to think. The proviso goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"or to any landlord either in respect of an obligation to take over sheep stock at a valuation &#x2026;"</quote>
I appeal to the noble Earl, Lord Carrington. He knows something now, I think, about taking over sheep stock at a valuation, although he did not a few years ago. The sheep farmers of Scotland in about three months taught him that they at all events understand very well what it is. The noble Earl had to bring in a Bill and commence a retreat as fast as ever he could go from the absurd position which he had taken up and against which he was warned. The question of sheep stock is a question which runs into many thousands of pounds, and cannot be measured by taking land to the extent of forty or fifty pounds. Then the proviso goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"or in respect of any depreciation in the value of the estate of which the land forms part &#x2026;"</quote>
That may be an enormous question. Take, for instance, a part of Scotland which is at present in deer forests. You take away a portion of the low ground. That makes the whole of the rest of that forest valueless for the purpose to which it has been hitherto applied. The depreciation that may have taken place in that estate may be measured by thousands of pounds. How anyone can say that is a small question I fail to understand.<lb/>
After all, all that this turns on is "if the Court are of opinion." But supposing the Court says, "No, we are not of opinion," where then is the tenant farmer, where is the owner of the deer forest? They may whistle for any compensation. They have no right of appeal to anybody, and there they are, simply ruled out. Then, supposing the Land Court are of opinion that
<col>592</col>
damage has been done, they are to require the Board to pay compensation to such amount as they determine. Suppose either the tenant or the landlord thinks that the compensation is entirely insufficient and that he has been very badly treated, is he to have no appeal of any kind or sort? This Land Court is made omnipotent, and I venture to hope that this appeal&#x2014;I do not know that it is the best appeal, but it is the best I can think of at present and I am perfectly ready to listen to any other proposal&#x2014;will be given. But, what we will not listen to is a proposal that a reference from these experts to the chairman should be called an appeal. We know perfectly well that a Court of that kind is not likely to be anything more than a mutual admiration society, and I shall certainly take the sense of your Lordships upon this Amendment, because it seems to me that justice cannot be done unless there is some appeal from a Court of this sort. I endorse entirely everything that was said with such force by Lord Halsbury just now. Without an appeal, the whole of the small holdings of Scotland will be under a system comparable to which there is nothing in the civilised world so far as I know. And remember it is not merely with landlords who have not done the improvements that you are dealing, but with those who have. You do not dare say that they have not done their duty. Yet the noble Lord seems to think it right to place all this part of Scotland under a Court consisting of five men who know nothing about land or buildings or farming and who have had no personal experience of these things. I can only say, as an individual, that I should conceive that I was being most unjustly treated if I were placed under a Land Court of this kind and not permitted to have an appeal; and I believe all of your Lordships will agree with me in thinking that there is nothing so hateful or odious in this world as a sense of suffering from injustice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01978"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think my noble friend opposite has given the very best reason possible why your Lordships' House should pass this Bill in its entirety. He mentioned the fact that when I was first appointed Minister for Agriculture I knew nothing about sheep stock. That was absolutely true, and that only shows how foolish, if I may be permitted to say so, it is to send an Englishman to another country to decide all these questions which
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0301"/>
<col>593</col>
Scottish lawyers themselves are unable to decide and on which they give very wrong opinions. May I for one moment bring before the House what the difficulties of an English President are when he is first pitchforked into Scotland and told that he is Minister for Agriculture in that country. He finds himself in a different country, he finds a different land tenure altogether, and he finds people talking a different language which it is extremely difficult to understand. For example, in this Bill you have "landholders," "feuing," "advocates," "writers to the signet," "factors," "crofts" and "statutory tenants" who are yearly tenants although they hold leases. I submit that this is enough to puzzle any Englishman, however anxious he may be to try and do his best.<lb/>
Are we not here really, after all, straining at the gnat after having swallowed an enormous camel? Do let me remind your Lordships what in your wisdom you have already put upon the Statute Book. In the English Act you said that it was so necessary to get land for poor people that if an English landlord did not choose to give land for small holdings the Minister for Agriculture could take that land compulsorily. He could have it split up and divided amongst small holders, and he had to pay for the land. How was it to be paid for? The price for buying it, or for leasing it, was to be settled&#x2014;by whom? By a valuer sent down by the President of the Board of Agriculture himself, and that price was absolutely final. Your Lordships passed that; and what has happened in the three or four years during which this has been the law of the land? I have been attacked in this House and told that some very hard cases have occurred. I have challenged noble Lords who made that statement to stand up in their places and substantiate it, but not one has been able to do it. I know it has been said on platforms that hard cases have occurred&#x2014;very curious statements at times are made on platforms on both sides&#x2014;but I do not believe there is one single instance of any hardship having been done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-01980"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: That was on Crown land. Then there is all this terror about the inequity of a Land Court. The

noble Marquess opposite, who is an Aberdeenshire landlord, was very eloquent on that subject last night, but there is another Aberdeenshire landlord, the Earl of Kintore, who has small holdings on his estate. Whenever any difficulty arises with regard to the rents he always consents to their being settled by tribunal such as the Land Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01981"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: That tribunal is merely somebody appointed by the landlord and the tenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01982"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Not appointed; agreed to. What is the result of having that Land Court? The tenants are tumbling over one another to get on to his estate. I have a land court on my own estate, and it has answered extremely well. I have had the estate for some forty years, and except in the case of death there have been only twenty-one changes on the estate during the whole of that time. Any man who thinks his rent is too high can go to any respectable valuer he chooses&#x2014;of course, not to the man he sells his bullocks to&#x2014;and whatever that valuer says should be the rent is the lent that is fixed.<lb/>
Let me tell you what, my own experience has been. The first test case that occurred was in the case of a tenant of mine who farmed 1,000 acres. He said that his rent was too high, and he went to a valuer whom he selected himself. The result was that when the award was given his rent was put up &#x00A3;100 a year. That tenant remained on his farm for another fifteen years before he retired, and the result of that action therefore was that lie paid me &#x00A3;1,500 in rent more than he otherwise would have done. I do honestly think that there is a great deal of unnecessary alarm about this Bill, and I hope, not only for the benefit of the poor man, but also for the benefit of the landlord, that your Lordships will in your wisdom allow this Bill to pass, as it will put an end to the dreadful state of emigration which is so deplorable in Scotland, and to a certain extent we hope it will put an end to the dreadful congestion and overcrowding in the towns which is not only a disgrace to our Christianity but to our common civilisation as well.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>(14) A new holder shall not be duly qualified for registration otherwise than by agreement who does not satisfy the Board as to his ability to fulfil the obligations incumbent on him.</quote>
really depends on the meaning of the word "ability." I take it that ability means that the tenant shall be a fit person to have a small holding, or that he has had some experience in small holdings. But it
<col>596</col>
is also very important that he should have the necessary capital with which to stock the small holding, and I should like to know whether the word "ability" covers that? It is a small matter, I confess, but the capital required on an agricultural farm is far greater than the capital required on a grass farm, and I think the words I suggest would make that quite clear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01992">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>Page 10, line 14, after ("him") insert ("and to stock and cultivate the holding without borrowed money").&#x2014;(<i>Lord Saltoun.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01993"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: This is the case of a tenant who is put upon a holding by the action of the Board of Agriculture and the decision of the Land Court. The intention of the Bill is to provide full compensation to the landlord for any risks which are incident to this tenant having a holding on his property. If the compensation is not full it is for the House to make it full, so that the landlord's interests are really secured. The Board selects the tenant in default of selection by the landlord, and certainly the risk and responsibility lie upon the Board and they will therefore take good care to see that their
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0303"/>
<col>597</col>
interests are protected. For these reasons I do not think the words are necessary, neither do I think they are advisable, because as a matter of fact it is very difficult to know when a tenant has borrowed money or not. Many farmers may be using borrowed money. I submit to the noble Lord that it is very inadvisable to put these words in the Bill; they do not help either party and are limiting words which I think serve no useful purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01994"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The Bill says that a new holder shall not be duly qualified for registration otherwise than by agreement who does not satisfy the Board as to his ability to fulfil the obligations incumbent on him. Obligations to whom? Does that mean to the Board and to the landlord, or only to one of the two? Although I admit that the noble Lord's point may not be a very large one, at the same time we ought to know whether this includes the landlord as well as the Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01995"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think obviously both&#x2014;on the one hand to the landlord to whom he has to pay rent, and on the other to the Board of Agriculture through whose action he may be the recipient of a loan for his buildings or other such purposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01996"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: That does not appear from the words as they stand, at all events not clearly. Would the noble Lord have any objection to the words reading "to fulfil the obligations to the Board and to the landlord," or "to all parties," or words of that sort?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01997"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: This clause is a long one, but I think the body of the clause makes it perfectly clear what the obligations of the tenant must be from his inherent position as a tenant put upon a holding otherwise than by agreement. But if the noble Lord will allow me to consider before Report whether these words can be usefully added I will be very glad to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01998"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord put down an Amendment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-01999"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: If advisable. I will communicate with the noble Earl about it.</membercontribution></p>
<col>598</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02000"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me that every landlord always ensures that a proposed tenant has capital sufficient to cultivate the land. If the Board confess that they are going to put people of straw on the land&#x2014;as I gather from the answer of the Secretary for Scotland they intend doing&#x2014;then the result will be that the land will depreciate altogether and possibly be thrown back on the landlord's hands at some future time, and he will have all the expense and trouble of putting it back into cultivation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02001"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: For all those risks the Bill provides compensation. The Board are responsible for them and have to face them in accepting tenants and preparing the scheme. I can assure the noble Lord that those risks are clearly laid on the Board of Agriculture.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02004">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02005"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: Subsection (16), which I desire to amend, lays down the size of farm in respect of which new holders may not be registered. It protects 150-acre farms, but the definition is, I think, unsatisfactory because it relies upon acreage alone. I suggest that it should be amended by the insertion of the words "or if exceeding one hundred and fifty acres not exceeding one hundred pounds in rent or annual letting value." Acreage alone is a very small guide to the value or importance of any farm. Take a holding of 150 acres of ordinary land worth about &#x00A3;1 or 25<i>s</i>. an acre. That is of some importance; it is quite self-supporting and one upon which a farmer may be expected to do well, to raise good stock, and employ a fair amount of labour. But if you take another holding of 150 acres with perhaps quite a few acres of arable land, and hill or rough pasture in addition, you may easily find that rented at 5<i>s</i>. or under, making a total rent of &#x00A3;37 10<i>s</i>., which brings it really into the category of small holdings; and you may extend that acreage over 150 to really a considerable extent before you get it within the limit. In those cases it would be unreasonable to allow any acreage at all until you get
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0304"/>
<col>599</col>
up to a certain limit of value as well as of area. The Amendment applies very largely to the west and particularly to the outer islands where cases of this kind would exist, although actually a 150-acre farm is very rare. If it does exist at all it probably will be quite a small croft, but the hill acreage there is much larger and until you come to one worth a rent of something like &#x00A3;100 it can hardly be regarded as self-supporting. I know that the wish of the noble Lord is as far as possible to make the holdings sufficient to carry a man and a family, and even though the limit which I propose may be something more than a self-supporting holding, yet it certainly does not bear any reduction of importance taken from it for the purpose of another small holding. On a holding of that size, one man may be able to make a living where it is quite certain two men could not possibly thrive, and I should like serious attention to be given to the Amendment because we do think it one of considerable importance. It is one which does not affect the Bill in any way at all, but would do a considerable amount of justice in the case of those who hold poor land over the actual limit of acreage laid down.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 10, line 22, after ("acres") insert ("or if exceeding one hundred and fifty acres not exceeding one hundred pounds in rent or annual letting value").&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clinton.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02007"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Through the courtesy of noble Lords who are interested in this Amendment I have been made acquainted with their views, and I am willing to accept the Amendment if they will be good enough to substitute the limit of &#x00A3;80 for &#x00A3;100.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02008"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad that the noble Lord has gone so far as to accept the principle on which the Amendment is based. This principle was recognised in the Crofters Act, 1886, but has been disregarded by those who promoted this Bill. Under that Act we gave security and fixity of tenure to a certain class of small holder, but I would like to remind your Lordships that that class was a class who were dependent for earning their living not on the land but on some subsidiary employment. This Bill proposes to go further and to extend this class at the expense of those who do occupy economic holdings. The noble Lord has fixed &#x00A3;80 apparently as the smallest rental
<col>600</col>
which a man can pay who is earning his living on the land. I would remind the noble Lord that it is a very hard life for the man who pays &#x00A3;80 a year rent. I should have thought that &#x00A3;100 was a small enough rent. A man who pays &#x00A3;100 a year is a small holder, and he is the very class of small holder that we want to get on the land. I see great danger in removing these men and covering the land with the class of men who will be occupying uneconomic holdings, and who will be dependent on obtaining some subsidiary employment which it may be very difficult to obtain. I would recommend my noble friend to accept the compromise which has been offered, but I do fail to see why the safeguards which were put into the Act of 1886 have not been included in this Bill. The noble Lord talked about the small holders in Denmark and Belgium yesterday. I really fail to see why the man who can earn his living on the land should be at the mercy of any agitation to remove him and should be forced to obtain some other occupation in some other department of life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02009"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I am glad the Secretary for Scotland has met me to some extent. Although it is not exactly what I want, I am glad to see some signs of the softening of the heart of the noble Lord with regard to some of these Amendments. I think we ought to have had the "hundred pounds," but as I cannot get exactly what I want I suppose I must accept what I can get and I am glad to move the Amendment in the new form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02010"><member>THE LORD CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment proposed is in page 10, line 22, after "acres" to insert "or of an annual value as entered in the valuation roll not exceeding eighty pounds."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02011"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I would prefer it in this form&#x2014;"or, if exceeding 150 acres, of an annual value as entered in the valuation roll not exceeding eighty pounds."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02017"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: This Amendment also is of some importance. It is to alter the date in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (16) from 1906 to the time when the Bill actually comes into force. It is a very unusual thing to legislate for what has taken place during past years, and I cannot see why this Bill should be made retrospective in this way. Many engagements have been entered into quite <i>bona fide</i> between landlords and tenants during the last six years, and it seems a great pity to disturb them.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02019"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The ground upon which this was retained in the Bill was that on the introduction of this Bill on the earlier occasions frill notice was given to everybody of this legislation.

I propose to add the words "after due notice has been given to the owner and occupier of
<col>602</col>
such lands or buildings." The object is not only to enable the owner or occupier, if he wishes to do so, to state to the gentleman who values the land that he has an objection to the land being taken, but also to ensure that the land is properly valued. I know in Ireland it has been sometimes the case for the valuer not to go on the land at all, or turn a single sod, and it has been stated also that land has been valued in Ireland when under a foot of snow.</membercontribution></p>

The officers of local authorities, sanitary authorities, and such like, have no similar obligation imposed upon them.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02167"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I listened carefully to my noble friend Lord Camperdown when he dealt with appeals on questions of fact, and also to the speeches of Lord Halsbury and the Lord Chancellor in reference to appeals on questions of law. I consider that as the Bill now stands with regard to appeals on questions of law it is very unfair. It provides that the Land Court may, if they think fit, and shall on the request of any party, unless the Land Court consider that such request is frivolous or vexatious, state a special case. Surely it is not fair to make the Land Court the judge in its own case; some other tribunal surely should decide whether the request is frivolous or vexatious. I suggest the words should run in this way, "and shall on the request of any party, if a Judge of the Court of Session certifies that such request is not frivolous or vexatious." The parties would then apply to the Judge of the Court of Session and he would give the certificate if he thought it ought to be given, and the appeal would go on. This is a matter of real importance, because surely on all points of law which are not frivolous or vexatious there ought to be an appeal; in fact, the Lord Chancellor invited us to suggest any reasonable Amendment to this proposal. I beg to move those words.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02194"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask a question on this clause. If your Lordships will look at subsection (3) (<i>a</i>) you will see the words&#x2014;"Any land the present rent of which within the meaning of this Act exceeds fifty pounds in money, unless such land (exclusive of any common pasture, or grazing, held or to be held therewith) does not exceed fifty acres."
<col>616</col>
I apprehend that the rent limit which the Bill proposes to put is &#x00A3;50, but I would ask the noble Lord to consider this point. I can imagine fifty acres in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh or Glasgow, for example, being held at a rent of &#x00A3;200. Surely the intention of the Bill, as I understand it at present, is really to limit it to a rent of &#x00A3;50. The importance of the point will be seen later when Lord Balfour moves his Amendment with regard to land within burghs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02195"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Amendment is really in the phraseology of the Government itself, and this subsection which I propose to reinsert has been in the Bill at every stage during the whole of its history until the last stage in another place, where it was dropped, as far as I can make out, practically without any public reason being given. I have searched the Parliamentary Reports, and I cannot find the reason why this important subsection was dropped at the last moment. The point is this, that agricultural land in burghs is put to various uses. If it is put to the use of a market garden it is excluded under the Bill as it stands. If it is put to the use of a dairy farm it is not excluded. A great part of land which is in this sort of farming use is just the sort of land which is getting ready for feuing, and for the erection of buildings and houses if the burgh is extended. There is a great deal of care now taken in having the extension of burghs properly planned out before they are proceeded with, and the work done by town planning societies and societies of that class will be seriously interfered with if this subsection is not inserted. As I have said, this is exactly the land which is required, especially for workmen's houses, and there is, to their credit be it said, a distinct movement amongst those owning land round burghs, especially in the West of Scotland, to favour these town planning societies, and to give them tracts of land at moderate prices, certainly at less than their absolute market value. I am sure we are all agreed that as far as possible this class of workmen's houses should be put up as separate cottages, or semi-detached cottages, rather than in tenements, and the more expensive you make the land the more likely you are to get tenements than cottages.<lb/>
The reason why, if this Amendment is not inserted, the land will be made more expensive is this. You are going by this Bill to give to the tenant of this class of land a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0313"/>
<col>617</col>
right which he does not now possess, and if, when he has got that right, having paid nothing for it, the landlord has to resume possession, he will have to buy back from the tenant the right which has been given to him by this Bill. That will make the land more expensive, and not for the benefit of the landlord but for the benefit of the tenant to whom you are giving this new right. The Convention of Royal Burghs, who are certainly not interested as landlords, have presented a Petition with regard to this clause, in which they say&#x2014;
<quote>"Your petitioners beg to point out that the Bill will be a serious encroachment on the Town Planning Act, and create impediments to the proper carrying out of the provisions of that Act for the laying out of towns arising under the town planning scheme. The Bill is also within burghs bound to create a multiplication of holdings to be used for purposes inconsistent with the amenities of public health."</quote>
In the Petition of the Corporation of the Royal Burgh of Dunfermline there is a clause to exactly the same effect. It says&#x2014;
<quote>"During the present Session of Parliament a large addition to the area of the City of Dunfermline has been made by a private Bill, and it now extends to Rosyth. There is a large tract of agricultural land which is now within the burgh which if this provision is not excluded will come under the provisions of this Bill for compensation purposes, and the operations of those who are working along with and in the interests of the Government at Rosyth will be seriously impeded."</quote>
I do not think I need elaborate that point further. I have had many letters on the subject.<lb/>
There is another reason why I am anxious that this Amendment should be inserted. If it is not inserted and the clause relating to statutory tenants remains as it is, it applies to Section 2 of the Crofters Act of 1886, and makes it applicable to the resumption of land by the proprietor. That section, excellent to the crofter, is perfectly inconsistent with the circumstances of burghs. In the larger burghs of Scotland there are no crofters, and there are certainly none in such places as Greenock, and Port Glasgow, and Dunfermline. If Section 2 is the only power on the resumption you will find the power the landlord will have is only for roads the construction of which the proprietor has to make practicable for carriages from the croft or crofts to the high road or the seashore. Those are the words. It makes absolute nonsense of the provisions of this Bill if you are to apply
<col>618</col>
that as the power of resumption in the case of statutory tenants. Statutory tenants are put in the position of getting this right within burghs, There are no crofters, and no necessity for roads, and yet, as I understand it, the only purpose for which the landlord can resume is for making roads for the crofters to the seashore. I am pretty confident I am right about that. It has been put before me in a carefully-written document by a skilled lawyer, but I think upon the broad general ground that I have given it would be much wiser to reinsert this subsection, which as I have said was only deleted at very short notice on the last stage of the Bill in another place.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02198"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I wish to confirm every word that has fallen from the noble Lord. With regard to the last remark that he made, that this Section 2 of the Act of 1886 as amended by this Bill is insufficient by itself to give the rights which I believe the Bill intends to give to the landlords, I quite agree with him. If the noble Lord looks at Clause 19 of this Bill he will see that it gives a larger power of resumption for feuing, and I think that is probably what he wishes to do. This exemption of land within burghs existed in every Bill before, and existed in this Bill right up to the Third Reading in the other House. The burghs were under the impression that their land was exempted, and they were very much surprised when they found on Third Reading that this had been changed. I presented two Petitions yesterday&#x2014;Lord Balfour referred to them&#x2014;from the Convention of Royal Burghs and also from Dunfermline, pointing out how this inclusion would interfere with the burghs. I have also a Petition from the Provost and magistrates of Greenock to the same effect. This proposal might conceivably also have some hardship on these small holders themselves, because they might receive notice at once to quit in order to prevent their continuing and becoming statutory tenants under the Act. I feel sure there is a very good case for many reasons for the exclusion of lands within burghs.</membercontribution></p>

Obviously the inclusion of burgh land may cause difficulties, especially in populous and growing burghs, in regard to the resumption of land. On the other hand, there are burghs in Scotland remote from these tendencies to development which find themselves with a comparatively large acreage of land within their boundaries, and which desire the benefits which this Bill offers. These considerations had to be balanced one against another, but my inclination is to think that the least difficult course is the course suggested by the noble Lord, and I propose, therefore, not to oppose his insertion of these words.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02211"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: Might I ask, with all deference, whether Lord Balfour's Amendments to Clause 28 are really consequential. I think the real consequential Amendment is one that I have just handed to the Lord Chairman, that the word "Board" in line 35 should be changed to "Department," and so throughout Clauses 28, 29 and 30. There is a difference of opinion on this side of the House as to exactly where the Congested Districts Board should go, and I think a good many Peers consider it advisable that the powers of the Congested Districts Board should be transferred to the Department of the Board of Agriculture to be established in Scotland under Lord Balfour's Amendment inserted yesterday. A certain number of Peers on this side consider that to that Scottish Department of the Board of Agriculture the duties of the Congested Districts Board should be allocated. I do not know that it is necessary to go into the reasons why we think so, because I gave them fully last night. If any Peer wishes to inform himself as to the duties of the Congested Districts Board he
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0315"/>

will see them set out on page 1 of their Report for last year. Among other duties are the aiding and development of agriculture, the aiding of the cultivation of seed potatoes, migration, crofting, fishing, and so on.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02213"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: If my Amendment is carried the noble Lord is quite right that it would prejudice the Amendment he has put down. I cannot pretend to take up the position of being a defender of the Bill. The noble Lord would probably not accept me as an advocate for it, but even he will probably agree with me that if the policy of having a Scottish Department of the London Board of Agriculture is to be carried out it would be additionally disagreeable to him that the Congested Districts Board should be transferred from the jurisdiction of the Secretary for Scotland to that of the Board of Agriculture. I am satisfied from my experience that it could not be satisfactorily so carried on. I am certain that the President of the Board of Agriculture in London could not get touch of all the circumstances with which the Congested Districts Board have to deal. I quite admit, of course, that the money matter must be arranged, and I did not put down any Amendment upon that point with my other Amendments because I thought it was wiser to wait and see what view the House took of the proposal. At a subsequent stage of the Bill it will be necessary to face that question if the policy I ventured to advocate the other day were carried out. Clearly the Congested Districts Board must be given back its money. Whether we can do that in this House without a breach of privilege is a question on which, of course, the authorities must be consulted. There are two ways of doing it, either that this House should do it so as to send down a complete scheme as altered to another place, or that we should not touch the question of money but leave the matter to be discussed and, as I suppose it will be, decided in another place. Personally I propose to put down the Amendment
<col>622</col>
necessary and see what argument is used against it. But so far as what the noble Lord, Lord Lovat, suggested goes, I am bound to say I personally am entirely unable to advocate the idea of transferring the work of the Congested Districts Board to a Board with its headquarters in London.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02214"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: With regard to the point of finance I do not think, as far as I am able to judge, that there would be any power to apply any portion of the &#x00A3;200,000 to the Congested Districts Board. The proposal of the Bill is to abolish the Congested Districts Board, and if this Amendment were carried the effect of it, of course, would be to continue the Congested Districts Board, and at present there seems to be no financial means of paying that Board. But, apart from that question, I think I said last night that Lord Balfour's proposal with regard to the Congested Districts Board appeared to me to create a situation which did not seem altogether clear or satisfactory. I have not the same administrative experience as Lord Balfour, but I do not see why the duties of the Congested Districts Board should not be discharged by this Scottish Department which is to be created in Edinburgh. Lord Lovat is much better acquainted with the Highlands than I am, but the duties which are now discharged by the Congested Districts Board would be assigned to the Scottish branch. What are their duties? The duty which the Bill imposes upon them is to perform the various preliminary stages with regard to constituting new holdings. I do not see why the officers of the branch should not be able to constitute an Agricultural Commissioner, or whatever you like to call him, and why he should not report to the Land Court just as much as a Commissioner of the Agricultural Board. I do not see why he should not be able to go to various parts of the country, as is now proposed, and see whether there is a demand for small holdings, and, if it cannot be arranged otherwise, why he should not propose to the Land Court that they should make an order for that purpose. Then there is the work of the Congested Districts Board in the Highland district. I do not see why the Department could not do that work just as well as the present Congested Districts Board car, and I am not altogether certain whether the Congested Districts
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0316"/>
<col>623</col>
Board is supposed to have been so very successful in the Western Highlands. There are certainly instances which one could quote with regard to that. Perhaps Lord Lovat will correct me if I am wrong, but the Congested Districts Board are said very frequently to have rather spoiled the breeds of horses and cattle, and so on, and by no means to have improved them by the animals which they have brought in. Is that so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02215"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I should not like absolutely to say so, but I do say that over certain questions with regard to horse breeding, and certainly over questions such as scab amongst sheep, we in Inverness-shire have had a certain amount of dealings with the congested districts there. There are only about 700 tenants, but for the last ten years I think they have been responsible for half the scab in Inverness-shire. Perhaps I am exaggerating that point a little; but certainly to my own knowledge in a good many years they have had more scab finings in the congested area than in the whole of the rest of Inverness-shire put together.</membercontribution></p>

But it seems to me that if you do not accept Lord Balfour's Amendment the result will simply be that the duties which are now discharged by the Congested Districts Board will be handed over to the Scottish Department of the Board of Agriculture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02217"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: This is too important a matter to be decided on the question of whether there is more sheep scab in one part of Scotland than in another. But the difficulty I have in supporting the Amendment of my noble friend behind me is this. Although it is quite true that the Scottish Department in Edinburgh might of themselves be quite a proper body to carry out the work of the Congested Districts Board, there is a real difficulty in the fact that the Minister responsible for that Board would be resident in London. The system of agriculture in the Western Highlands is very largely a different one, and that is one of the few matters that I do not think it would be desirable to place in the hands of a Minister for Agriculture resident in London.</membercontribution></p>
<col>624</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02218"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps it would be convenient for me to say a word on this question. Lord Camperdown and Lord Lovat, as I understand, made an attack upon the Congested Districts Board with regard to the sheep scab in Inverness-shire. As they both know, the question of sheep scab is a matter for the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in London, and the Congested Districts Board have nothing whatever to do with the administration in that respect except on their own properties. It is not unnatural, I think, that the noble Lord should hesitate to transfer the duties of the Congested Districts Board to a Minister in London, because if I mistake not he was the author of the Act of 1897 which established that Board. If the then Government had considered it advisable to put them under the President of the Board of Agriculture it was perfectly free for them to take that course. I put aside for the moment the question of privilege. After all, it seems to me that the differences on this point which have been disclosed by the speeches of noble Lords opposite are differences which concern them in the first place, and not His Majesty's Government. They have to face a dilemma. They must either by their action of last night remove the administration of the Congested Districts Board to London, or take the other course. I think I may say, in passing, that the noble Lord's repugnance to transfer the administration of agriculture in seven of the counties of Scotland has, I think, an indirect bearing upon the policy which he supports. It throws a certain amount of light on the policy which he supports for the rest of Scotland. That is one horn of the dilemma. The other horn is this, that you may have throughout the congested area the Secretary for Scotland with the powers of the Congested Districts Board to help agriculture and with even these powers to create small holdings, and you leave in the very same counties his colleague the President of the Board of Agriculture responsible for the creation of holdings on a different system. Could anything be more likely to lead to waste, to over-lapping, and to friction? I cannot think that any responsible Government could possibly lend its authority to such a proposal. But, as I say, while I am very ready to give any help that I can in elucidating the difficulties which noble Lords opposite have to face, I profoundly regret the

course on which they have embarked, and I think it is bound to lead them into greater difficulties as the discussion of this Bill goes on.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02266"><b>32.</b> With respect to statutory small tenants the following provisions shall have effect:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(1) A statutory small tenant means and includes a tenant from year to year, or leaseholder, not otherwise disqualified in terms of this Act, in regard to whom section two of this Act provides that he shall not be held an existing yearly tenant or a qualified leaseholder, and the successors of such tenant or leaseholder in the holding, being his heirs, legatees (if bequest is permissible in law), or assignees (if assignation be permitted by the lease):</li>
<li>(2) Except so far as expressly applied by this Act, the Landholders Acts shall not apply to statutory small tenants:</li>
<li>(3) A holding which is or has been held by a statutory small tenant shall not be merged in or amalgamated with any other holding as defined in the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1908, except with the sanction of the Board:</li>
<li>(4) Except in any case where the landlord satisfies the Land Court that there is reasonable ground of objection to a statutory small tenant (hereinafter in this section referred to as the tenant) and the Land Court find accordingly, the tenant for the time being shall, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, be entitled on any determination of the tenancy to a renewal thereof on the terms and conditions hereinafter specified:</li>
<li>(5) Except so far as varied by this section, the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Acts, 1908 and 1910, shall apply in the case of the tenancy of a statutory small tenant in the same manner as if the tenancy were a lease, and for the purposes of those Acts and otherwise the tenancy, as renewed from time to time, shall be deemed to be a lease current for the period of renewal:</li>
<li>(6) Subject to the provisions of the last-mentioned Acts and of this section, the landlord and the tenant may agree upon the terms and conditions of the renewed tenancy:</li>
<li>(7) Failing agreement, the landlord or the tenant may apply to the Land Court to fix an equitable rent or to fix the period for which the tenancy is to be renewed, and the Land Court may thereafter determine the rent to be paid by the tenant or the period of renewal, or both, as the case may be:</li>
<li>(8) In determining the rent the Land Court shall, so far as practicable, act on their own knowledge and experience, taking into consideration all the circumstances
<col>630</col>
of the case, holding, and district, including the rent at which the holding has been let, the proposed conditions of the renewed tenacy, the improvements made by the landlord and tenant respectively, and the then condition and value of such improvements; and shall fix as the rent to be paid by the tenant the rent which, in their opinion, would be an equitable rent for the holding between the landlord and the tenant as a willing lessor and a willing lessee: Provided that they shall allow no rent in respect of any improvements made by or or at the expense of the tenant or any predecessor in title for which he or his predecessor, as the case may be, has not received payment or fair consideration from the landlord or his predecessor:</li>
<li>(9) Subject as aforesaid, the terms and conditions of the renewed tenancy shall (except so far as agreed to be varied) be those of the determining tenancy, in the same way and to the same effect, as nearly as may be, as if the tenancy had been continued for the full period of renewal under tacit relocation, and the tenant shall be entitled, if he so desires, to a renewal on those terms and conditions:</li>
<li>(10) The Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) 1908 and 1910, as applied by this section, shall be varied as follows (that is to say):&#x2014;</li>
<ul>
<li>In the Second Schedule to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1908, the Land Court shall be substituted for the Board, and where in terms of that schedule a person is nominated as arbiter by the Land Court his remuneration shall be paid by the Land Court:</li>
</ul>
<li>(11) In the event of the landlord at any time failing to provide or maintain the buildings and permanent improvements suitable to the holding, in so far as the tenant is not required at common law or by express agreement in writing to do so, it shall be lawful for the tenant to apply to the Land Court to so find and declare, and if the Land Court after hearing parties (if thy desire to be heard) shall so find and declare, the tenant shall as from the date specified in the finding become a landholder, and the definition of landholder in this Act shall include such tenant and his successors in the holding, being his heirs or legatees:</li>
<li>(12) It shall be lawful for the Board to provide model forms of agreements for optional use by landlords and tenants under this section, provided that nothing herein contained shall make the use of any such form compulsory:</li>
<li>(13) In the event of any dispute arising as to whether a person is a statutory small tenant within the meaning of this Act, it shall be competent for the Land Court to determine such question summarily:</li>
<li>(14) Section two (as amended by this Act), subsection four of section six, and section twenty of the Act of 1886, section two of the Act of 1887 down to the word "summarily" and subsection nineteen of section seven, subsection four of section

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02267"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved an Amendment in subsection (1), after the word "legatees" ["and the successors of such tenant or leaseholder in the holding, being his heirs, legatees"], to insert "as defined in Section 16 of the Act of 1886." The noble Lord said: I move this Amendment to draw attention to the fact that the word "legatee" in this subsection has been given a wider sense than it has been given in the remainder of the measure. Under the Crofters Act and under the first part of this Landholders Bill, the word "legatee" means the wife or any person who, failing nearer heirs, succeeds in case of intestacy. There is no qualification of the word "legatee" in this subsection, and consequently there will be a power of bequest without any limit at all. When the Bill was first introduced in another place, and, I think, even after it got into Committee, the qualification of the Crofters Act was done away with, and the same wide signification was given to "legatee" as is given in this subsection. For reasons which seemed good in another place they reversed that; they limited the significance of "legatee"; and I am suggesting to the noble Lord that by omission they did not continue that limitation to this subsection. If that is the case, I need not trouble your Lordships with any further argument in the matter; but, if not, I must say a word or two more upon it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02269"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: If it is any convenience to the noble Lord I will state the position of the Government, and it will perhaps save time. The truth is that in dealing with landholders we applied the terms of the Crofters Act. In dealing with statutory small tenants, who are only the tenants of landlords and for whom the landlords make their improvements, it was part of the proposal that these tenants should be left in all particulars under the Agricultural Holdings Act. Therefore the power of bequest was left as under the Agricultural Holdings Act. Now the noble
<col>632</col>
Lord wishes to import the Crofters Act power of bequest as superior to the Agricultural Holdings Act power of bequest. In the Crofters Act it is a more limited power of bequest. I am not able to say, and I do not suppose the noble Lord is, whether he speaks with authority&#x2014;that is to say, as representing those who have come to this agreement&#x2014;but I have no objection to accepting these words on the condition that I am not to be bound by them at a later stage if it should turn out to be the fact that those who came to this agreement in this matter prefer the words as they are now in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02270"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged to the noble Lord for his explanation. I need only point out that I am not, as he says, doing away with anything in the Agricultural Holdings Act by putting in these words. While the Agricultural Holdings Act, it is true, gives to a tenant an unlimited right of bequest as far as his existing lease is concerned, this Bill goes a great deal further; it nominates these people as successors of the tenants, and by the succession they become tenants, and under a further subsection&#x2014;I think subsection (4)&#x2014;they are entitled on the determination of the lease to a renewal. So that whereas the Small Holdings Act gives to the tenant an unlimited right of bequest for the remaining years of a terminable period, this subsection gives to the tenant an unlimited right of bequest of his holding for periods which are continuously renewable. The extension is a very great one. But as the noble Lord is willing to accept my words I will not bother further about the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02279"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved to delete from subsection (7) the words "apply to the Land Court to fix an equitable rent or to fix the period for which the tenancy is to be renewed, and the Land Court may thereafter determine the rent to be paid by the tenant or the period of renewal, or both, as the case may be," and to insert in their place the words "have an equitable Tent or the period for which the tenancy is to be renewed determined by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1908, as amended by this section."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02280">The noble Lord said: This opens up the question of the Land Court on a point which I endeavoured expressly to reserve when we were discussing the question of an appeal. We have in the former part of this Bill accepted the Land Court as a part of the proposal of the crofting system, but we are now dealing with tenants who are altogether outside the crofter system. Their position is entirely different, because they are ordinary tenants on an estate who have no right of ownership. Now we say no ground can be shown for extending the crofter system of valuation to a non-crofter body of tenants. We have obtained in the former case a right of appeal in certain circumstances, but that right of appeal cannot apply here, because this part of the section will only apply to revaluation, to resettling small farms which will be in all probability infinitesimal in amount, but which, if spread over an aggregate may be of very considerable importance to a man owning a large number of holdings. But it is almost impossible to imagine that in any single case you will get a demand for a reduction of rent even amounting to &#x00A3;400, and I say the former Amendment as to giving an appeal cannot apply at all to this part of the section.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02281">When we are dealing with small matters of land valuation of this kind it is as important as in great matters to have it carried out by somebody who is thoroughly acquainted with the land with which he deals. We want, in the first place, to have a certainty that this valuation shall not be carried out by a central body sitting in Edinburgh, who, however competent and free from politics they may be, will not know the small details of land in many parts of Scotland. Consequently we propose that the system in the Schedule to the Small Holdings Act of 1908 should be
<col>634</col>
adopted, and that, instead of this valuation taking place by the Land Court, it should be by valuers mutually appointed, and, failing agreement, by the Board. In that way we get a form of valuation to which we are accustomed and which has been very successful in Scotland, and the decisions of which are accepted without any dispute. In almost every case that I know of&#x2014;and I have been connected with hundreds of cases of valuation under the Agricultural Holdings Act&#x2014;the valuer is agreed on by the parties, and we have never had to go further to get one appointed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02282">Now, we get two great points if we accept this valuation. The parties themselves will be satisfied with the valuers, having helped to appoint them and we get for certain a local man acquainted with the nature of the soil, one who knows the district and is competent to decide this very critical question as to whether a croft is worth &#x00A3;10 or 10 guineas. There may be cases in which the question of rent resolves itself into the case of a pound or two; they will be all, I think, very small cases. I regard this as of really great importance. I am not now grumbling at the question of revaluation at all. I have no objection to revaluation on principle, but I object to it being compulsory, because I do think that that will lead to considerable trouble in estate management, and probably to a good deal of friction; but I am quite certain none of us have any desire to overtax our tenants, and it is desirable that there should be a revaluation of estates to avoid their being over-rented. I could accept that at once, provided we could get a tribunal to value which we could consider to be a fair and reasonable one. The noble Lord knows exactly our case under the Land Court, and I will not trouble to repeat it. But whether the Land Court could be a fair system or not we are certain that this can be and is a fair system. It is one which has been well tried, and which we have been quite ready to adopt.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02283">It has been my misfortune to have to argue this point on almost every occasion in this House when questions of agricultural holdings have come up either in England or Scotland, and I am always met with the objection that arbitration may be very satisfactory in form but that it is very expensive and very slow. I am quite certain that those who raise these objections have in their view a fully

<col>635</col>
fledged system of valuation, where you have the whole panoply of a Court of Law, where you have counsel engaged, where you have expert witnesses and everything else. We want none of these things. We do not like Courts of Law&#x2014;we are afraid of gentlemen in wigs&#x2014;but we do want adhered to the system to which we are accustomed of one or two men going on the land themselves and settling on the spot immediately and summarily what the rent of the land should be.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02284">There is one other point on which I want to add a word. Under the Small Holdings Act the valuer is appointed mutually, and, failing agreement, by the Board. Now in so far as that valuation under the Small Holdings Act is applicable to this section&#x2014;and it is applicable for the purpose of settling matters of compensation between outgoing and incoming tenants&#x2014;it has been amended, and the person or body which will appoint the arbiter, failing agreement, is now no longer to be the Board but it is to be the Land Court. In many respects, of course, I should have preferred that it should have been the Board, but as it is apparently the wish of the Government that the Land Court should take its place, then I am quite willing, even in regard to this arrangement, that the final appointment of the arbiter, failing agreement, should be the Land Court.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02286"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I wish to say only a single word in support of what has fallen from my noble friend. So far as new holdings are concerned, we have reluctantly, I admit, conferred upon the Court the right of fixing the rent, and so on. The noble Lord's Amendment refers solely to existing tenants, and he proposes that in their case the simple form of readjusting the rent which has hitherto been followed should be continued. As to that being the cheapest and easiest way, I do not think there will be two opinions, on this side of the House at any rate. But further than that, with regard to the present tenants you accepted the Act of
<col>636</col>
1908 for everything almost except this question of rent, and you accepted it for compensation. You find the Act referred to several times in the course of the section, and really this question of rent is the only question which remains. The system of agreeing on an arbiter has been, I believe, in general use in Scotland and has proved a success. Why with regard to these present tenants should not you continue it? The result otherwise, if they do not agree, will be that one arbiter will be appointed by the Court. The noble Lord can hardly object to this proposal; at least it seems to me to fall in with the general scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02287"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: May I point out that in subsection (7) of this clause the words at the beginning are "Failing agreement." Therefore it is quite open to the landlord and the tenant to come to agreement in the first place in the matter of rent. I cannot agree with the noble Lord that this system which he proposes as a substitution for the system in the Bill will necessarily be a cheaper system. So far as experience goes of the fixing of rents by the Crofter Commission, the cost to the tenant, or to the landlord, is not greater but less than the cost of employing even the system of a single arbiter. But, apart from these points, there are two reasons why I am sorry to say I cannot accept the Amendment. In the first place, the noble Lord founded his argument partly on the ground of the Court being incompetent&#x2014;[LORD CLINTON: No, no.] Forgive me&#x2014;that it would not have the local knowledge necessary; that it would be a Court sitting in Edinburgh, and so forth. But, on the contrary, not only will this Court of itself, I hope, have an adequate knowledge to enable it to discharge its duty, but it will have full power to appoint for itself assistant valuers, assessors, and the like, to give to it the support of any particular local knowledge required for the decision of any particular set of cases. Then if security of tenure is to be given, surely it must be admitted that the security which tenure requires in cases of dispute is an impartial and independent tribunal to fix a fair rent. That tribunal we have secured by the Bill. So much for the merits. I do not enter into any legal argument upon the merits, but there is a second reason why I am debarred from accepting this Amendment and those consequential upon it. It is this, that this clause has been the subject of what has
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0323"/>
<col>637</col>
been described this afternoon by the noble Lord opposite as something in the nature of an agreement. To that agreement a representative of the Government was a party. I do not know how far noble Lords opposite are bound by the terms of that agreement. I say I do not know, and I make no complaint. But I say for myself that I am bound, and for that reason as well as on the merits I cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02288"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I have heard the reply of the noble Lord with the greatest possible disappointment. I am bound to say that if this Amendment or anything like it could have been accepted it would have gone further than any other Amendment suggested to remove difficulties about this whole policy of including statutory tenants. What was the main argument of the Lord Chancellor against the Appeal Court? It was the same argument that was put before the House of Commons by the Lord Advocate against another proposal for an appeal. The Lord Advocate's words were these&#x2014;
<quote>"Ever since 1845 questions involving large sums of compensation for land taken have been confided with quite satisfactory results to the judgment of a single arbiter, and in the long run in 99 cases out of 100 the judgment of the umpire as between the two arbiters has sufficed to decide the question without there being any power of appeal or right of review."</quote>
That is our case. We are not allowed by the Bill to appoint the man into whose power the whole of our property is delivered. If we had the power of appointing or agreeing upon the arbiter, or, if we do not agree upon the arbiter, of having the arbiter appointed by an independent person, a great deal of our objection to this particular procedure would at once fall to the ground.<lb/>
The noble Lord talks about the adequate knowledge of the tribunal which he is to set up. I believe he will do his best to make it an impartial tribunal, but it is the adequate knowledge that they will think they possess to decide everything that we are afraid of. The adequate knowledge of one part of the country is not adequate for another part. When you go to arbitration you both take care to select somebody who knows the circumstances of the particular district, even almost of the particular parish part of which is the subject of the arbitration. It is because we value that power that we are anxious to go as
<col>638</col>
far as possible&#x2014;at least I am&#x2014;to meet this proposal to set up a class of statutory small tenants. As it stands in the Bill I say, without fear of contradiction, that it is the most violent and uncalled-for invasion of the just rights of private property that Parliament has ever been called upon to sanction. If we had this power of arbitration instead of the Land Court, over whom we have no control, probably a great deal of my difficulty would be removed, because it would not then matter about the size of the holding or the district of it. I am quite willing to agree that the landlord and tenant may not always be able to solve the question of what is a fair rent, and I will go so far in agreement with the noble Lord as to say that the small holder is at a special disadvantage, and therefore I would be willing, and I think all landlords who value their character as good landlords would be willing, to have a really independent and impartial tribunal to help them. I have heard with profound regret the refusal to accept this proposal.</membercontribution></p>

"If you agree upon the valuer, pay him yourself; if you cannot agree, we will pay him." I am afraid that will be a great inducement in some cases for a tenant to say to the landlord. "No, I cannot agree with you as to the arbiter." I suggest to the noble Lord that that is not a result which should be desired. I do not suppose that he desires it, but I think that he would obtain it under this clause. I am not quite certain why the Land Court should be asked to give its approval to an arbiter who is appointed solely by the two parties, but I wish to follow the line of least resistance, and if the Government are willing to accept the Amendment in those terms I shall be glad.</p>

This subsection imposes a special injustice on landlords which is not, I think, intended by the framers of this Bill. As I understand, the object is to create statutory small holdings with equitable rents and not small holdings at a fixed rent which is not equitable. This subsec-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0325"/>
<col>641</col>
tion seems to me to transform the statutory small tenant into the other class without sufficient reason. Perhaps your Lordship will let me give an instance as shortly as I can of what I mean. Supposing a statutory small tenant wishes the landlord to make a certain improvement, say to build a pigsty at a cost of &#x00A3;50, and the landlord does not think it necessary. In that case the small tenant appeals to the Land Court, and if the Land Court thinks the pigsty necessary it follows that the Land Court does not direct the landlord to carry out the improvement, but it says that the statutory small tenant becomes at once a landholder with all the advantages that a landholder has. The subsection runs&#x2014;
<quote>"In the event of the landlord at any time failing to provide or maintain the buildings and permanent improvements suitable to the holding, in so far as the tenant is not required at common law or by express agreement in writing to do so it shall be lawful for the tenant to apply to the Land Court to so find and declare, and if the Land Court after hearing parties (if they desire to be heard) shall so find and declare, the tenant shall as from the date specified in the finding become a landholder, and the definition of landholder in this Act shall include such tenant and his successors in the holding, being his heirs or legatees."</quote>
The words which I propose to insert give the landlord an opportunity of carrying out what the Land Court deem to be just and suitable for the holding, and would prevent his statutory small tenant being turned into a small landholder at once because he had refused to carry out some small improvement which he deemed unnecessary but which the tenant thought desirable. I hope the Government will see their way to accept this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02319"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: So far as I can judge all parties are better under the Bill as it stands than they would be under the proposal of the noble Lord. This subsection applies to the case of a tenant and landlord not being able to come to an agreement as to the erection of certain buildings or making certain improvements. If they cannot agree they go to the Land Court, which is obliged to hear the parties. Now what are the alternatives? The landlord
<col>642</col>
may consent, in which case they never would have to go to the Land Court. But, on the other hand, he may be unable to carry out the improvements and may wish to say so. Or, again, he may wish to have the opinion of the Land Court upon the dispute which has arisen; or he may possibly refuse. In any case the main interest of all concerned is not to interrupt the cultivation of the holding&#x2014;that, is, the maintenance of the farm. I do suggest that with the safeguard in the Bill that the Land Court are obliged to hear parties, it is undesirable that in every ease there should be six months interval elapse before anything is done. Both parties may wish to go ahead, and in that case they are debarred by the noble Lord's suggestion. Assuming a fair Land Court, which is the hypothesis upon which I am obliged to argue this question, a Land Court which has no interest that is either for the landlord or for the tenant, I honestly believe that the landlord is better off under the Bill, with the freedom and the discretion of the Land Court as it is at the service of the tenant, than otherwise. He is better off under the Bill. It does not matter one jot to the Land Court whether his tenant becomes a landholder or remains a statutory small tenant. They have no jot or tittle of interest in his falling into one category or into the other. They have simply to decide fairly between the parties and endeavour to give their help judicially.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02320"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I rather think the noble Lord has not taken the point of the objection.

What Lord Oranmore objects to is that after the Court has decided that the shed is to be put up no time is given to the landlord in which to put it up, but the tenant becomes <i>ipso facto</i>, owing to the decision, there and then a landholder.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord told us the other night&#x2014;he was not very certain at first&#x2014;that this really was the effect of the Bill. I believe that from a legal point of view that is correct, but still we must remember that the Land Court is not to be composed of lawyers. There is to be, one lawyer on it, but that is all; and I think for the information of the landlords and tenants this matter should be made clear. There is really no harm in stating the fact that this right of creating voluntary holdings should hereafter remain. A slight alteration has been suggested to me in the terms of my clause, and with your Lordships' permission I will move it as altered.</membercontribution></p>

I understand that there is one precedent for it, in a small amending Act to the Local Government Board Act of 1908, which proceeded also, I suppose, from the Scottish Office draftsman. I feel a difficulty in regard to this. There is no legal talent available at the moment to guide us as to what this really means.

<title>AEROPLANES IN WARFARE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02380"><member>THE EARL OF HARDWICKE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government, in view of the practical demonstration of the utility of aeroplanes in warfare in Tripoli, and in the French, German, and Roumanian man&#x0153;uvres, and in view of the fact that France already has at her disposal between 200 or 300 war-planes and military pilots, and in view of the fact that Germany has at least fifty qualified military aviators besides numerous others in training, and not less than four military schools, and considering that Great Britain leas only six officer aviators and only two serviceable aeroplanes, whether the Government will now make a statement of its policy with regard to the training of the necessary mechanics, pilots, and military observers and the provision and maintenance in war of sufficient aircraft. so as to remove the serious disadvantage which we at present suffer in this respect; and to ask if the Government propose to give any practical encouragement to the manufacturers of this country with a view to enable them to supply the Government with British built machines.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02381">The noble Earl said: My Lords, before putting the Question that stands in my name I wish to make a correction which I do not think really materially alters the significance of the statement I make in the first paragraph. That correction is this. I state that Great Britain has only six aviation officers and two serviceable aeroplanes. I beg now to correct that statement. Great Britain, I am informed, has thirteen aeroplanes, two of which, if I may borrow a term which is well known in naval circles, might be relegated to Rotten Row; eight, I believe, can be considered serviceable&#x2014;serviceable, that is, for training purposes. They lack speed, and I do not think they would pass those tests that were lately carried out at the instigation of the French Government. Three you have
<col>650</col>
which are ready to take the field at any moment. I do not think that has materially altered the statement in my Question. With those facts that I have laid down, which I believe are substantially correct, surely it is chargeable to the Government that it shows apathy and a deplorable lack of enterprise when we consider what our neighbours in France and other. Continental countries possess. I do not mean to say that I know all the facts of the case, and I have no very strong indictment to make against the War Office, because I know that in the War Office there are a number of people, and even some of the heads, who realise the enormous potentialities of this new adjunct of war. I lay the charge at the door of the Treasury, and that I believe to be warranted by the substantial facts. I now put the Question which stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02382"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has put the Question standing in his mime with a preface in which he refers to our apathy compared with Continental Powers, and he very kindly put the blame on the Treasury. But I do not think the blame should be put on the Treasury. If there is any blame at all it is to be put upon us at the War Office and upon the Admiralty. The Treasury has never stood hi the way of this matter. On the contrary, the Treasury has given us the greatest scientific establishment in the world for investigating air problems&#x2014;the establishment at Teddington&#x2014;whieh ought to give us a very admirably-equipped department at Aldershot, and which has done and is doing very valuable work. The Treasury has never stood in our way in any respect.<lb/>
I myself feel very great responsibility for the spending of public money. I am always ready to spend it, and spend it with the utmost freedom, when I know how to get good results out of it; but there is one thing which I never will listen to as long as I am responsible, and that is to lavish money in the hope that something will come of it. It is quite true that in this country we are behind, but not a great deal behind, with this problem. But there are reasons for that. First of all, nothing develops your aviation department so much as an enormous Army which has to operate within a restricted field and on ground which is more or less level, and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0330"/>
<col>651</col>
where your air service is required as part of that enormous Army organisation. In France and in Germany they have these conditions, and the result is that the air service has responded to the demands of the Army. With us it is quite different. We require our air service for sea purposes; we require it for the purposes of a comparatively small Army&#x2014;a very small Army compared to those Continental Armies&#x2014;and one which has to go abroad, and a large part of which is constantly at a great distance. You cannot have that condition of things without its reacting on the mode of your preparations, and I think perhaps the fact that we have not the acute military problem of the Continent, or, at any rate, the problem on the same extensive scale, has had a good deal to do with another cause which has retarded aviation in this country, and that is that the public have not applied themselves to it in the practical way that has been the case in France and in Germany.<lb/>
I will indicate some of the causes which make it difficult for Ministers to know exactly how they ought to stand in the matter. We set to work on this problem two or three years ago, and the first thing we did was to endeavour to acquire the requisite scientific knowledge. That to a great extent we have done, but the whole field of air work proves to be still in a very undefined condition. I do not mean for us merely; I mean everywhere. Germany is apparently changing the type of her airships. She seems to be turning, as France has turned, from the airship to the aeroplane. But it is by no means certain that an intermediate type of small airship will not prove to be of great value, and that problem appears to be one on which foreign countries are working, as we are working on it. It is a great mistake to suppose that abroad they have made up their minds definitely as to the line on which they are working. They are making experiments and on a huger scale than we are, because they have Armies of much greater size to work for. But at this moment I doubt whether there is any country that could tell what the ultimate form of air craft will be. When we look at things from a distance they appear much better than when close, and we see flaws which I admit to be very great in our organisation but which get much magnified in comparison with other countries because we are looking very close. We have twelve aeroplanes, and three more
<col>652</col>
under construction at the present time. Of these aeroplanes it is difficult to say how many are suitable for war. We have been buying a variety of different types, a variety within these figures, in order to see which is the best. Some of them undoubtedly are as good aeroplanes as we could buy. The noble Earl put them, I think, at eight as serviceable for war.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02383"><member>THE EARL OF HARDWICKE</member><membercontribution>: No, only three that would go into the fighting line.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02384"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Well, my information, which I should be sorry to put forward dogmatically, is that a larger number would be good for the fighting line. But there arc some of those that are more adapted for practice than for fighting. We are buying steadily, and it is not a question of money. We have enough money tinder the present Estimates to buy five times the number of aeroplanes that we have at the present time. It is only a question of what is the best type to buy, and that is by no means an easy thing to determine. Aeroplanes change almost every month, and the large numbers which they have on the Continent would, I am afraid, if they were subjected to the close scrutiny of the noble Earl, come under quite as just criticism as he has applied to our numbers. As I say, we have twelve, of which I should say that a good many, or considerably more than the three the noble Earl mentions, are serviceable for war, while others are adapted for practice; and some are under construction. That is nothing like enough, I agree. To compare with Continental numbers we should have a considerably greater number. Then the noble Earl asks about dirigibles, and I will tell him about that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02385"><member>THE EARL OF HARDWICKE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Viscount's pardon; I did not put a question about that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02386"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Then I will not dwell upon it. The reason I referred to them was that I thought the noble Earl meant to cover them by this Question, because he uses the word "aircraft"
little lower down. Anyhow, we have in construction at the present time several airships. We have one actually working, and a second with which we have made experiments and this is incapacitated just now. Then there is a third, the "Delta," which is practically constructed; certain
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0331"/>
<col>653</col>
difficulties are being put right in it. For the fourth the materials are collected, and we have a very efficient factory which is working under Mr. Mervyn O'Gorman, with a very good staff, which is endeavouring to evolve the best type of small dirigible. I should be very grateful if the noble Earl could tell me what is the best type of small dirigible. If he cannot, nobody else can. We have to proceed experimentally in these matters.<lb/>
Now I come to what has been done about officers. As the noble Earl knows, we have recently constituted an Air Battalion, which has a present strength of 171&#x2013;14 officers and 135 rank and file, besides warrant officers, sergeants, and so on. Of these officers actually serving at the present time with the Air Battalion there are seven who have been trained in flying. There are thirteen other officers who have pilot certificates, and who have asked to be employed in connection with this battalion; ten of them are Regulars, two Special Reservists, and one retired. Then there are several more officers who have taken pilot certificates but have not at present asked for employment. A notable case is that of General Henderson, Staff Officer to the Inspector-General of the Forces, who is so keenly interested in this matter that he has taken out a pilot's certificate and qualified himself. Then there are several others. We are going, I agree, not very fast, but we are moving. We have a certain number of aeroplanes for which we have got these officers. The General Staff has defined the test we should work up to and the objects at which we have to aim, and we are now addressing ourselves to the question, which I think is a very important one, of how far we can work our establishment and our training schools along with the Navy. With a very small Army relatively, such as we possess, it is very desirable in order to develop to the utmost the potentialities of your service that you should work it along with the Navy, and we are considering that question at the present time in a practical form.<lb/>
I think I have now answered most of the questions which the noble Earl put to me, except the one at the end. We have under practical consideration the proposal to offer prizes to manufacturers. The noble Earl says "the manufacturers of this country." As soon as we have got the type right our policy will be to manufacture these aero-
<col>654</col>
planes in this country, because they are like war material which is different from other material. That will be done, not with any particular desire to have everything manufactured in this country, but for the simple reason that it is war material and you cannot get it elsewhere in time of war. As for the design, that is too important a matter to limit. The first consideration is to get the very best design for a war aeroplane that you can, and I do not at all tie the Department which I represent to limit itself for designs to British manufacturers. We shall see how that works out, and we shall consider it with perfect freedom.<lb/>
I will only add, in conclusion, that slowly as we are going we have given a great deal of time to this matter in conjunction with my right hon. friend the Civil Member, Colonel Seely, who is deeply interested in this question, and the Staff Officers at the War Office, and I should be very much puzzled to find a means of going faster. We are moving. I agree that the service as yet is very inadequate, but the difficulties for us are greater than they are in any other country. Slowly we are evolving things. In the case of motor cars this country was for a long time behind, but is now quite as well placed as any other country; and I have very little doubt that, with the practical genius of our race, we shall evolve our own type of aircraft which will be suitable to the conjoint requirements of our small Army and our great Navy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02387"><member>THE EARL OF HARDWICKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after hearing the noble Viscount's answer to the Questions I have put I feel rather like the man who has asked for a whole loaf and is only allowed a bite of the loaf. As far as I can see, my noble friend puts this country in regard to the Army on the plane of Roumania. With all due respect to that virile State, Roumania is not, I suppose, to-day, in aerial matters better than we are. I know it is the idea of the War Office in a certain way to emulate our neighbours the French. They are going to give a competition. Well, it is questionable whether the value will be very great that is to be gained by it. There is no doubt in the mind of anyone who has really followed aviation that aviation has come to stay. It has also become an adjunct to the Army. There is no doubt of that. That is realized by the War Office. In view of that I cannot see why this apathy should still exist. Why
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0332"/>
<col>655</col>
not take a leaf out of the pages of the French? Why not help the industry to-clay? The French are in the forefront in this new science. It is a growing industry. And why are the French in the forefront? Because they have been subsidised by their Government. You never have shown any indication that you mean to help our manufacturers. We have to look to private enterprise in these matters. I do not wish to make any indictment, or to go into any searching statement, as to the way in which the money has been spent. I will make a particular statement&#x2014;perhaps I had better not. But you had a considerable sum of money, and you have nothing to show for it. The sum of &#x00A3;80,000 has been expended in doles by Parliament, and you have nothing material to show for it. I will not say more, but I can assure the noble Viscount that there is a very strong feeling in the country on this subject amongst those who really know. They regard the apathy that is shown towards this question in this country as remarkable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02388"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all my official experience and prejudices as ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer would induce me to refrain from pressing the War Department in regard to anything that would involve unnecessary expenditure. But I do think that in this matter there has been very slow progress indeed, and that my noble friend behind me is well advised in calling the attention of your Lordships to the subject. When I listened to the speech of the noble Viscount opposite I confess I was not very much encouraged to hope that progress, which has been slow in the past, will be more rapid in the future. The noble Viscount appeared to me to be waiting for some design of perfection in this matter. Now, that has never been the policy of the Navy, and quite rightly, too. I remember ships built on designs which were considered reasonably good but which it was hoped in future years to improve upon, in order that we might be provided with what at any rate was the best that could be obtained at that time. Perhaps it might appear that hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds have been wasted in that way, but it would never have done to have been unprepared if the moment had arisen when the force was wanted; and I would venture to tell the noble Viscount opposite that I am afraid under present circumstances if we should un-
<col>656</col>
fortunately he involved in war we should be quite unprepared with regard to appliances of the kind which have been the subject of discussion. I do hope, therefore, that the War Office will take care that there is some provision in respect of aviation without waiting for sonic possible design in the future which may not be attained until it is too late.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EMPIRE TRADE RELATIONS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02390"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KILLANIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, when, in pursuance of the resolution passed at the Imperial Conference this year, a Royal Commission will be appointed to inquire into the commercial relations of the Empire and its shipping arrangements and means of transport, and whether, in view of Ireland's interest in such trade and means of transport in the North Atlantic, Ireland will be directly represented in the constitution of the Commission. As I believe the noble Lord who now represents the Colonial Office in this House will, in answering this Question, be addressing your Lordships for the first time, may I, as one who had the pleasure of knowing him when we were both Members of the other House, offer him very humbly a hearty word of welcome to this House.<lb/>
The Question which I have put on the Paper divides itself into two parts, and with your Lordships' leave I would like to make a few observations on each part separately. The first half of my Question
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0333"/>
<col>657</col>
asks the Under-Secretary when, in pursuance of the resolution passed at the Imperial Conference this year, a Royal Commission will be appointed to inquire into the commercial relations of the Empire and its shipping arrangements and means of transport. The question of the appointment of this Royal Commission came into existence in the following way. Mr. Fisher, the Prime Minister of Australia, had put down a resolution dealing with the commercial relations of the Empire in rather general terms, and when the matter came on for discussion at the Imperial Conference Sir Wilfrid Laurier, while expressing sympathy with the object of the resolution, said that in his opinion it was not likely to lead to tangible results, and that it was difficult to suggest improvements in the trade relations between the Dominions and the United Kingdom and between the Dominions themselves unless they had more information than they had at the present time; and on the strength of that he proposed the following resolution&#x2014;
<quote>"That His Majesty should be approached with a view to appoint a Royal Commission representing the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Newfoundland, with a view of investigating and reporting upon the natural resources of each part of the Empire represented at this Conference, the development attained and attainable, and the facilities for production, manufacture, and. distribution; the trade of each part with the others and with the outside world, the food and raw material requirements of each, and the sources thereof available, and to what extent, if any, the trade between each of the different parts has been affected by existing legislation in each, either beneficially or otherwise."</quote>
After that resolution had been proposed, Mr. Harcourt, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, said he had no difficulty in accepting the resolution provided the following was added to it&#x2014;
<quote>"and by what methods consistent with the existing fiscal policy of each part the trade of each part with the others may be improved and extended."</quote>
Now that was the resolution that was finally passed unanimously at the Imperial Conference, and it was greeted by the various Prime Ministers as a most practical way of dealing with this difficult question. Mr. Fisher called it "a most practical way of dealing with a rather difficult set of questions." Sir Joseph Ward also accepted it as a very practical way of dealing with the question, and he further pointed out that it would place information, and practical information, before them, and he said that they were really not in a
<col>658</col>
position to ask their respective Legislatures to do what might be necessary in the shape of legislation till they had that information. And finally the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"I think the Conference is very much indebted to Sir Wilfrid Laurier for making this very practical proposal. It will set up as the result of the Conference a body whose labours will certainly prepare the way, and possibly make the way plain, for effective practical action by the next Conference; and possibly before the next Conference meets, for the legislation of the Governments of the different parts of the Empire."</quote>
I do not think that I am showing any impatience in, after six mouths have elapsed, putting down a Question to His Majesty's Government to ask them when this Commission will be appointed, or, at least, what steps are being taken or have been taken to bring it into existence.<lb/>
I am well aware that a Royal Commission of this sort cannot he appointed in a hurry. The parties will not be merely interested or concerned in this country; they will represent the various Dominions of the Empire and the United Kingdom, and it stands to reason that there would be considerable difficulty in forming such a Royal Commission. Then the subjects to be considered by the Commission are also large and complex matters. The terms of reference would, too, probably present some difficulty. For all these reasons I do not wish to be understood as suggesting that I think there has been any avoidable delay, because I recognise the importance of the Commission and the many likely difficulties in bringing into being what will be the most important Royal Commission that has ever been appointed. Yet in view of the fact that this decision of the Imperial Conference was greeted as a very practical way of dealing with this question, and that the hope was expressed that the Commission would have reported in time for legislation to be carried out in the different portions of the Empire before the next Conference, and that six months have gone by since this resolution was passed, and we are now only three-and-a-half years oft the next Imperial Conference&#x2014;in these circumstances I think I am not impatient in asking that we should get some information on this subject, more especially as we are shortly rising and there will be no opportunity, in Parliament at any rate, of informing the public what progress, if any, is being made in the constitution of this Royal Commission.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0334"/>
<col>659</col>
In the second part of my Question I ask whether, in view of Ireland's interest in such trade and means of transport in the North Atlantic, Ireland will be directly represented in the constitution of the Commission. I confess that as an Irishman, while interested in the whole question, I am more intimately and more directly interested in the answer which the noble Lord may give to this part of my Question, and am glad of the opportunity of asking this Question before the Royal Commission has been appointed. It might be supposed that Ireland, being a poor country, had small commercial relations, and it might at first glance not be apparent why she should require special representation in such a matter. But I wish to point out to His Majesty's Government that the poverty or wealth of a country has little or nothing to say to its external commercial relations, to its imports or exports, and that as a matter of fact some of the poorest countries have much larger commercial relations than rich countries per head of the population of those countries. In that connection it is interesting to take the United States of America. The United States, in spite of being such a great and rich country, has, as a matter of fact, per head of population very small external commercial relations. I mean by commercial relations external imports and exports. The commercial relations of a country do not depend upon the poverty or wealth of it, but on whether that country is self-contained, self-supporting, and self-sufficing in its productions. It depends on its capacity to produce its own needs. There are, I submit to your Lordships, poor countries, such as Ireland, which, as a matter of fact, have large commercial relations per head of the population. The fact is, Ireland has the second or third largest commercial relations per head of all the countries of Europe. The reason is quite simple. It is because Ireland is a country that produces in large excess one form of product, and hardly produces at all another form of product, and therefore she has a great commercial exchange. I therefore hope that I have shown His Majesty's Government that. Ireland is a country that is peculiarly interested in any question likely to affect the commercial relations of the country.<lb/>
It may be said that Ireland is in the same boat as England in this matter; and if so, why should any separate consideration
<col>660</col>
be given to Ireland's interests. But Ireland's exports and imports are the exact opposite of Great Britain's exports and imports. As regards the commercial relations of Ireland to Great Britain, that is a great advantage. Differences between nations can, like differences between human beings, be either antagonistic or of mutual advantage, and, as a matter of fact, the difference in the commercial products that Ireland exports and imports and those which Great Britain exports and imports, each to the other, is a great commercial advantage to both countries, and the exchange fits in admirably. Therefore you might ask again, if Ireland is in that position, where do her separate interests in this matter come in. Her separate interests in this matter come in when you begin to relate the commercial interests of these two countries to a third party. As long as you are only considering Great Britain and Ireland the difference in their respective products is a benefit to both, and their commercial relations to one another are advantageous, but it is quite another matter when you come to consider their respective commercial interests and products in connection with a third party, such as Canada. Then the difference between their commercial products becomes extremely important, and it becomes therefore necessary, as I submit to His Majesty's Government, that Ireland's large, separate, and distinct commercial interests should receive direct representation on this Royal Commission. If I were asked to give an instance where Ireland was specially interested in the way I have described, I could not do better than refer to a topic which Sir Wilfrid Laurier and others at the Imperial Conference instanced as typical of the sort of subject that would come under the consideration of such a Royal Commission. That was the embargo on the importation of Canadian cattle. I am not going on this occasion to argue the merits or the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of that question. I only give it as one out of many of the commercial interests which would come under the consideration of this Commission, and in which Ireland, and Ireland especially, would be deeply and vitally interested.<lb/>
There are other aspects of this matter to which I would like very shortly to refer, and in which I think Ireland has a peculiar and special concern. In the past commercial intercourse across the Atlantic
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0335"/>
<col>661</col>
between Great Britain and America was mainly to the United States of America. But now there is the extraordinary development. of Canada, where cities and industrial concerns and the population are increasing at an amazing rate; and there is the position of Newfoundland also, which is now growing prosperously as a colony of the Empire, and we must bear in mind that traffic&#x2014;of passengers, mails, and freight&#x2014;from Great Britain across the Atlantic will he directed more and more in the future to Canada and Newfoundland. Now it is quite clear, as a geographical fact, that the shortest and quickest line, and therefore the cheapest and safest route, from Great Britain to Canada and Newfoundland must go through Ireland. In the case of any other route from Great Britain the ships must stiffer from inconvenience and delay and danger in going round Ireland. In this ocean trade route across the North Atlantic, as distinguished from trade routes going to the United States, Ireland is either an obstacle in the way, or it can be made, as I hope it will be made, a stepping stone on that route. That is another very important aspect of this question in connection with the shipping interests and the means of transport between the United Kingdom and the Dominion of Canada, in which, I would suggest to His Majesty's Government, Ireland has peculiar and special interests which ought not to be neglected, and which ought to be directly represented.<lb/>
I hope that His Majesty's Government will support the view which I have endeavoured to present, and that they will show their desire in this matter to serve and to develop and protect the commercial interests of Ireland which have been so much neglected. So much so is this the case, that one may say there is no country in the world where they have been less attended to, and where they more require attention. Mr. Bonar Law, in his speech in the House of Commons the other day, I was glad to see, said&#x2014; <quote> It has always been our policy, and it always will be my desire, to help in every possible way to develop the resources of Ireland;"</quote>
And Lord Lansdowne, at Derby, said last Friday&#x2014;
<quote>"Ireland has resources which require to be developed; she has industries which deserve to be encouraged."</quote>
<col>662</col>
I hope His Majesty's Government will not be behindhand in taking its part in protecting and developing the commercial interests of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02391"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD EMMOTT)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the first place may I thank the noble Lord opposite for his kind and courteous welcome to your Lordships' House. It is true that this is the first time that. I have spoken in this House, and it is also true that this is the first time I have ever spoken in either House in a Ministerial capacity. For six years I have had a good deal of experience in listening to speeches in another place, but I have had no experience in making them in regard to political questions; and therefore I shall find myself, I expect, a little out of practice in that department. I have in these circumstances especial need on this the first occasion on which I take any part in your debates to throw myself upon the kind indulgence of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The noble Lord began his speech by an account of what happened at the Imperial Conference, an account which I think was perfectly correct, and he expressed some concern at the apparent delay that has occurred in the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into our Imperial trade. His Question, I think, is a very reasonable one. As he pointed out, it is divided into two parts. The first part is as to when, in pursuance of the resolution passed at the Imperial Conference this year, a Royal Commission will be appointed to inquire into the commercial relations of the Empire and its shipping arrangements and means of transport. I am sorry to say that I cannot give a categorical answer to that question. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be able to tell the noble Lord now that the Commission would be appointed in a few clays time, and would commence its work within a few weeks. But, my Lords, correspondence in regard to matters of detail is taking place&#x2014;and correspondence is a very lengthy business in a world-wide Empire like ours&#x2014;between widely scattered parts of His Majesty's Dominions. I do not for a moment mean to imply that any difficulty has arisen. The negotiations and the correspondence are proceeding in a normal way to a satisfactory conclusion. But sonic further delay must occur before any announcement can be
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0336"/>
<col>663</col>
made. Therefore at present I cannot give any more precise answer to the first part of the noble Lord's Question.<lb/>
The second part of the Question deals with the separate representation of Ireland on this Royal Commission. I think I am bound to give a quite frank and straightforward reply to that question. The noble Lord opposite gave various reasons why Ireland should be separately represented. He stated that she has separate interests, and that those interests are affected when a third party comes into the question. He mentioned particularly as examples the question of the so-called embargo on Canadian cattle. That is a question about which I shall have something more to say in a few moments. He mentioned also the question of Atlantic routes. I quite agree with him that Ireland's interests ought not to be neglected in this inquiry, and I am quite sure that they will not be neglected. But a separate representation from Ireland would practically involve parcelling out the United Kingdom into geographical areas and appointing separate representatives from each part of the United Kingdom. I do not think it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to adopt that plan. Their intention is to appoint as representatives men who shall as completely as possible represent the general interests of the United Kingdom in this inquiry as to food, raw material and other natural products, and the production, manufacture, and distribution of each part of the British Empire. In other words, they will have regard rather to the general interests of the United Kingdom than to the particular part of the United Kingdom in which individual members who are chosen to serve on that Commission happen to live.<lb/>
I need not remind your Lordships that this must be an inquiry on a great scale. The British Empire is a vast Empire. Its resources, its production of food and other raw materials, its manufacture, its shipping, are all on an immense scale, and this kingdom is the head and centre of this Empire. I emphasise that point because the noble Lord opposite specially mentioned one matter in regard to which we know Ireland is specifically interested, and that is the question of the so-called embargo on cattle. I wish we could call that a requirement to slaughter at the ports, because I do not like the word "embargo."
<col>664</col>
That is really what it is. It is a requirement to slaughter cattle at the ports. I must point out that that question affects one branch of agriculture. Anybody who had the opportunity of listening to the interesting debate in this House the other night, in which that question was dealt with, roust realise its enormous importance, and anybody who heard the powerful speech of my noble friend Lord Burghclere will remember what a graphic picture he drew of the enormous destruction caused by cattle disease some thirty or forty years ago in this country. The question is of enormous importance. But what would be the effect of appointing a representative from Ireland especially with reference to that question? Would it not be to indicate that there was some change probable in the policy of this country, and if it did give any impression of that kind I venture to think it would be very misleading, and very much to be regretted. Again, why should that particular subject be chosen? There is an old legal maxim&#x2014;I know nothing about law myself, but it applies to this matter&#x2014;<i>inclusio unius exclusio alterius.</i> I think it does apply to this question. If you appoint a representative in regard to one branch of agriculture, are you not inferentially saying that other questions relating to agriculture are of minor importance?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02392"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KILLANIN</member><membercontribution>: My proposal was not that there should be a representative from Ireland so as to represent one branch of agriculture, but that there should be a representative from Ireland of Ireland's commercial interests, because they are peculiar to Ireland and different from those of Great Britain. I only mentioned the cattle embargo because it was mentioned at the Imperial Conference so much.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02393"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord combined the two things. He was to be a representative of Ireland, and he would represent, in the first instance, as one of the questions in which Ireland was specially interested, the embargo on cattle. However, I will not further pursue that question. It does seem to me that if we were to adopt a plan such as I thought the noble Lord suggested we should not get as good a representation of the general interests of the United Kingdom as I think and hope will be obtained under the plan of the Government. A little reflection,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0337"/>
<col>665</col>
I think, will show that it is better in an inquiry of this magnitude to appoint the representatives with a view to their knowledge of the general interests of the United Kingdom, rather than to choose them because of that part of the United Kingdom in which they happen to live or with reference to what must in a vast inquiry like this be comparatively sectional interests.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02394"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KILLANIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot express myself satisfied with the reply received from the noble Lord. Ireland in fiscal or commercial matters is always doomed to be badly treated or disregarded. The noble Lord insists upon treating the United Kingdom as one commercial unit, and as having similar commercial interests in this matter. I have endeavoured to show to him that the commercial interests of the two countries are different, and that, although that difference is an advantage as between the two countries, it would be very important that it should be properly represented when you came to consider the relation of the different commercial products of the two countries to other parties. Therefore I do press upon him that he should recognise in this matter the geographical distinction between Ireland and Great Britain. As regards Great Britain itself, roughly speaking, its commercial interests all over the country are similar. It is a great manufacturing country, importing food stuffs. Ireland is a country with hardly any manufactures, and exporting food stuffs. Ireland and Great Britain have, therefore, distinct and different interests in this matter, and I hope that when His Majesty's Government come to finally settle about the appointment of this Royal Commission, they will see that Ireland is entitled to receive, and should receive, distinct representation on it. I do not suggest for a moment that the person appointed should only represent his own corner, so to speak; nor do we contemplate that the Premiers from the different Dominions are going only to represent their own corner. I would, of course, expect that whoever was entrusted with the Irish case would fit in his view as well as possible into the general conditions of the situation, and have full regard for the great world-wide objects of the inquiry that was to be held. All I suggest is that there should be some one on the Commission who would be competent to present Ireland's case.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BRITISH INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02395"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose to move that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for all correspondence between the Colonial Office and the South African Administrations on questions relating to British Indian subjects which has taken place since August, 1910. The noble Lord also had the following two Questions on the Paper&#x2014;(1) To ask the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies whether any reply has been received to the communication of the Secretary of State to the Union Government regarding certain disabilities imposed upon British Indians resident in the Transvaal by the Draft Municipal Ordinance and how far the Draft. Ordinance has been proceeded with; (2) to ask the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he can give the substance of the replies, if ally, of the Union Government to the representations of the Secretary of State as to the complaints of the British Indian population regarding the operation of the Transvaal Gold Law, 1908, and Townships Amendment Act, 1908 and 1909.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02396">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Questions I have put on the Paper have reference to a series of interpellations that Lord Ampthill, who is, unfortunately, not present to-clay, has addressed to his Majesty's Government from time to time on Asiatic subjects connected with South Africa. Considerable doubt exists in South Africa on the point. I would ask whether the Government would lay on the Table the correspondence which has taken place between the Colonial Office and the South African Administrations on questions relating to British Indian subjects which has taken place since August, 1910, up to the present time. The first of the two Questions which I have to ask has a particular bearing on the point in regard to the licences issued to Asiatic traders&#x2014;that is, licences in respect of shops, trolley drivers, hawkers, &amp;c. I believe it may be argued, that some of these licences are not suitably differentiated, or, rather, that Asiatics are not differentiated as regards Europeans, and that therefore they have no cause of grievance. But what they are aggrieved at is that the municipalities or local councils who issue the licences are naturally in many cases traders and competitors in the lines of business carried on by the Asiatics and therefore they are not very likely to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0338"/>
<col>667</col>
obtain fair or equal treatment, and they ask that this should be remedied. They ask, at least, that there should be a right of appeal to a resident magistrate or some authority who would be more likely to be impartial than the local councils and municipalities. That is the grievance felt, as naturally they are competitors one with another. The second Question has reference to the position of leases and stands held by Asiatics. By the Act of 1885, I think it is, an Asiatic cannot hold fixed property, but a fiction has been allowed to grow up and has been recognised by the Supreme Court in the Transvaal that an Asiatic may be the owner of property if there is a nominal owner in the person of some friendly European. That is a system that has been allowed to prevail hitherto. Now under the law of 1908 this system is not allowed, and a European is liable to a heavy penalty if lie accepts the nominal ownership of such a place. In the result it is plain that these Asiatics will be driven off these different stands and will be segregated in locations solely inhabited by coloured persons. This, it is said, would be going against the policy always upheld by His Majesty's Government. These are the specific points on which I ask for information.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02397"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for all correspondence between the Colonial Office and the South African Administrations on questions relating to British Indian subjects which has taken place since August, 1910.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lamington.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02398"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will know that I have only been at the Colonial Office for a few weeks, and, of course, he will know that this particular question of the treatment of British. Indians in South Africa is one of the most delicate, difficult, and complicated of all the questions with which we have to deal at the present time. I cannot pretend as yet to be a master of the question or to know the whole history of the case from the beginning, but I hope to be able to give a reply not entirely unsatisfactory to the Questions of the noble Lord. I will deal with his Motion in regard to the Papers and with the two Questions at the same time.<lb/>
The matters with which the noble Lord's Questions deal are, of course, constantly receiving the careful consideration of His Majesty's Government. As regards the
<col>668</col>
Union of South Africa there was published in March last a Parliamentary Paper [Cd. 5579] containing with other Papers a draft Bill to regulate immigration into South Africa based on proposals made to the Union Government by the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, when he was Secretary of State for the Colonies. The main object of those proposals was to put an end to differentiation against Indians in the text of immigration legislation, and to terminate the movement of passive resistance on behalf of Transvaal British Indians, particulars as to which will be found in still earlier Parliamentary Papers of this series. The position of Indians was that while they acquiesced in the exclusion of fresh Indians, with the exception of a limited number required to cater for the religious and professional needs of the resident population, they desired that such exclusion should be by means of administrative action, and not by differentiation in the text of the Bill on the ground of race or colour. They also desired the repeal of the Transvaal Registration Act of 1907, as they held that its repeal had been promised at an earlier stage in the Transvaal.<lb/>
It will be seen from the text of the Bill published in the Command Paper to which I have referred, and from the published correspondence, that these desires of the Indians would have been provided for. The Bill was read a second time with certain amendments which went still further in the direction of meeting the views of Indians; for example, by saving the rights of domiciled Indians, and by providing that the fresh Indians of the religious and professional class who were to be admitted should be exempt from registration as Asiatics in the Transvaal. The discussions in the Union Parliament, however, revealed certain difficulties and defects in the Bill. One difficulty arose especially regarding the question whether the fresh Indians to be annually admitted into the Union should have the right to enter the Orange Free State, from which, as the noble Lord knows, Asiatics had been practically excluded altogether. The Union Government accordingly decided, with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government, to withdraw the Bill last session. In announcing this decision the Minister of the Interior intimated that the whole question would be further considered in the light of the criticisms of the Bill, and that an amended Bill would be introduced next year.
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0339"/>
<col>669</col>
At the same time an agreement was arrived at with the Transvaal British Indians by which the passive resistance movement in the province was brought to an end. That is the history of the question up to comparatively recent times.<lb/>
Now I have to tell the noble Lord that correspondence respecting the terms of a new Immigration Bill is still proceeding, and it would not at the present time be proper to lay Papers, though His Majesty's Government will have no objection to considering at some future time whether they can lay Papers with regard to this question, with the concurrence of the South African Government. The noble Lord's Motion calls for a publication of all correspondence back to 1910, and in his Questions he refers to correspondence on two specific points&#x2014;the Draft Transvaal Municipal Ordinance and the Transvaal Gold Law and Townships Amendment Acts of 1908 and 1909. The correspondence up to March, 1911, as regards the question of immigration, has already been published in the Command Paper to which have referred [No. 5579], and I have already answered the noble Lord's question as to the publication of further correspondence on that question. Between August, 1910, and March, 1911, other correspondence dealt almost entirely with the passive resistance movement in the Transvaal, and as a provisional settlement of that question has been arrived at, I think the noble Lord will agree that no good end will be served now by publishing Papers with regard to it. As regards the correspondence since March, 1911, on subjects other than immigration, it will probably be sufficient on the present occasion if I state the substance of the replies of the Union Government on the two specific points raised in the Questions, without publishing the correspondence. First of all, as to the Transvaal Municipal Ordinance, that was referred to a Select Committee of the Provincial Council, whose Report will not be brought up until the Council meets in January. The Union Government have, however, stated that in all, or nearly all, of the points complained of the Ordinance merely repeats existing legislation; and in regard to the specific points about which it is thought that a grievance may still exist, which were mentioned by the noble Lord, I may say those points are now the subject of correspondence between the Home Government and the Union Government.<lb/>
<col>670</col>
There remains for me only to deal with the question of the Gold Law and the Townships Amendment Acts of 1908 and 1909. The Union Ministers state that they do not understand the grievance alleged to have been imposed on Indians by the Townships Acts. With regard to the Gold Law, it has been laid down in a judgment recently given in the case of Tamblin <i>v.</i> Rex by the Supreme Court of South Africa that there is now no restriction imposed by the Act on the letting to Asiatics of any stands laid out under the Mining Laws prior to 1908. I think, therefore, the noble Lord will see that the difficulties of which he has spoken have been to a large extent removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02399"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I think noble Lords will agree that the reply of the noble Lord who has addressed us for the first time, and on whose first appearance in our debates I must be allowed to congratulate him, was on the whole satisfactory, as it certainly was sympathetic. I agree with the noble Lord that no more complicated question ever collies before this House than that of the position of British Indians in South Africa. I had to deal with the question myself for some years while in India, and I have kept in touch with it. ever since; and there is, not on this side of the House alone but equally among noble Lords opposite, a genuine desire that this running sore, for it is nothing else, on the surface of the Empire should be satisfactorily removed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, I think, gave a perfectly satisfactory reply to the first Question about Papers. He reminded us that the last Papers were presented to us only in the Spring of the present year, and he told us that when matters are further developed we may reasonably ask for more. The fact is, as you will have gathered from the speech of the noble Lord, there are really two aspects to this case. There is, first, the large issue of the admission of Indians to residence in South Africa. This has been, of course, the main bone of contention between the two parties for all these years, and has resulted in the movement of passive resistance with all its painful and distressing features to which the noble Lord referred. I have taken great interest in that question, not only because of the acute form it had assumed when I left India, but at a later date I was in South Africa and had
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0340"/>
<col>671</col>
communications with General Botha and General Smuts and with the British Indian community, and there was a good deal of discussion as to a possible basis of compromise. It is that compromise that has been embodied in the Bill to which the noble Lord referred, and I would ask His Majesty's Government most earnestly to keep their eyes fixed on the progress of that Bill. We understand that certain difficulties occurred which prevented the passage of the Bill into law last year, and that it was withdrawn with the consent of the British Indian community, but the Bill is to be introduced again in the forthcoming session. If there were, as I do not think there is likely to be, any slowness on the part of the Union Government in South Africa in pushing forward the matter, I am certain that the noble Lord opposite, as the custodian of wider interests even than those of South Africa, will see that the matter is proceeded with without delay.<lb/>
Then there is the smaller issue raised by the other Question of my noble friend behind me. They are matters, of course, narrower and less important than those raised by the bigger question of admission to South Africa. But as any noble Lord will understand who reflects that the great majority of these British Indians are small people engaged in petty trade, they are intensely personal to the everyday life and interests of settlers in that country. The restrictions under which they live and pursue their trade have been regarded by them as exceedingly vexatious in the past, and have been responsible, perhaps even more than the larger restrictions, for the trouble that has arisen. As regards the first of these two sets of grievances mentioned in the second Question of the noble Lord, I gathered that the reply of the Under-Secretary was a satisfactory one. Upon the second matter I understood the noble Lord to say that the Union Government are of opinion that the case of grievance does not arise; that there has been a misunderstanding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02400"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: I think there has been some misunderstanding as between the Townships Act and the Gold Law. The Townships Act refers, of course, to the land in the townships, in which the law is different, and the Gold Law refers to land in mining districts outside the townships. I think there has been some confusion between the two.</membercontribution></p>
<col>672</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02401"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: That, of course, is a confusion that we cannot elucidate or remove in this House. I would merely ask the noble Lord, in discharge of the duties of his new office, to keep an eye upon the smaller as well as the larger issues, and if he can help to remove these petty grievances he will do a great deal to earn the gratitude not only of British Indians in South Africa but of those in India also.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02402"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: I can assure the noble Earl that there is nothing the Colonial Office is more anxious to do than to remove these grievances, which are a real source of difficulty not only to us, which is a small matter perhaps, but also to the Empire, and our constant endeavours will be extended in that direction.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02406"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill to give jurisdiction under Section 76 and Part VIII of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to certain British Courts in foreign countries. It has been brought about by the fact of a certain appeal having been made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 109 on the question of the steamship "Maori King," and it had reference to a dispute as to the jurisdiction of a foreign Court at Shanghai. I should say that under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, which relates to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Crown in certain foreign countries, a number of Courts have been established at places abroad and have been furnished with powers for dealing with criminal and civil cases. The expression "foreign countries" is defined in the Act as meaning any country or place out of His Majesty's Dominions, and therefore includes British Protectorates as well as foreign countries properly so called. Of course, in this case it also includes a Treaty port such as Shanghai. The alterations made in the actual clauses are first of all to meet the case of this steamship "Maori King," which was
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0341"/>
<col>673</col>
sailing under British colours although owned by Russian owners. The first portion of the amending Bill is intended to give to these foreign Courts the same powers of dealing with ships which have become subject to forfeiture as are conferred by a section of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, on Admiralty Courts in the United Kingdom and in British possessions abroad. The second is to make the definition of the powers of these foreign Courts absolutely clear. In this particular case at Shanghai it was argued that the wording of Section 504 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, taken in conjunction with the decision in the "Maori King" case, precludes such Courts from dealing with cases of limitation of liability. It is to make the matter quite clear that this other amending clause is put into this Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02419"><member>LORD KENYON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a Bill to enable the students of the Welsh University to obtain registrable qualifications under the Medical Acts to enable them to practise as doctors if they obtain medical degrees. By the Supplemental Charter of 1900 the University was allowed to confer medical degrees, but that did not carry the registrable qualification necessary for them to practise. That qualification is now carried in the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham, the Scottish Universities, and the Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham and Bristol Universities, and therefore we appeal to
<col>676</col>
your Lordships to allow the University of Wales to stand in the same category as the Universities I have mentioned. This Bill has been considered by the Medical Council, who have given it their approval. It has passed the House of Commons without any opposition, and, indeed, without any debate. It is, of course, most important that the standard for the examination should be a good one, and we think that that is guaranteed because the General Medical Council and the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons have representation on the Medical Board. By Statute the University has fixed six years as the qualifying period, which is longer than, or as long a period as, that of any other University. There is a medical school at Cardiff controlled by a medical board, and there are, also at Cardiff infirmaries and hospitals where students can walk, as it is commonly called. In short, I do not think there is any reason why the University of Wales should not be granted this power. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PERSIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02425"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> rose to call attention to the state of affairs in Persia, to inquire as to the policy of His Majesty's Government, and to move for Papers. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is not present, to-day. Ho had intended to take part in this discussion, but he is prevented by circumstances with which your Lordships are familiar, and which you all deplore. My object in rising is to call attention to the state of affairs in Persia. It is a very anxious and critical situation, and is calculated, I think, to cause serious apprehension in the minds of those who have a regard for Persian independence, and who would like to sec that country, once so mighty and powerful, take its place again among the nations of the world. I hope to obtain some statement of the policy of His Majesty's Government from the noble Viscount opposite. I have, I need hardly say, no indictment to frame against His Majesty's Government. I have not that desire, and oven, if I had, I have not the material for doing so. What I want in the main is to ascertain from the highest quarter what that policy is. I am not clear that His Majesty's Government have a thought-out policy or that they know precisely in what direction they are going.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02426">My first object, therefore, is to enable the noble Viscount, if he desires to do so, to take this opportunity of giving us explanations and information about points which are at present obscure. My next object is to point out certain developments of the present situation which, unless they are foreseen and guarded against, will lead to a position extremely dangerous both to Persia and to ourselves. I have a sort of suspicion from what I read that we are drifting on to dark and perilous rocks in our Persian policy, and it may even happen that Persian independence will vanish while we are discussing by what methods it may best be maintained. I conclude my Question by a Motion for Papers. I believe that the last Papers presented to Parliament were contained in this White Paper which I hold in my hand&#x2014;Persia, No. 1, 1911. That carries the narrative of events down to December, 1910, or nearly a year ago. I do not desire to press the noble Viscount on the matter, but I need hardly say that if the Secretary of
<col>678</col>
State should find it possible at an early date to lay Papers dealing with what has happened since then, it would be a source of great satisfaction to those of us in both Houses of Parliament who are interested in the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02427">In the remarks I have to make I propose to confine myself to recent events and not to trouble your Lordships with anything in the nature of a retrospect. That would be tedious and really not necessary for the present position. The only incident in the past, and that a very recent past, to which I need refer is the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement in September, 1907. As we have often been informed, that was a great and momentous event in the history of Asia. It was the starting point, if not the direct cause, of the greater part of what has since happened in Persia, and I expect its consequences will be found to be greater and greater as time goes on. As your Lordships will remember very well, that Agreement related not to Persia only but to all those various spheres in which British and Russian interests come in contact with each other over the entire surface of Asia, and as such that Agreement has been one of the two main pillars of British foreign policy during the last six years, the other, of course, bring the <i>Entente</i> with France in Europe. Over and over again His Majesty's Government have congratulated themselves and the country upon the salutary effects of this Agreement&#x2014;its effects upon the peace of Asia, upon the security of our Indian frontier, upon the finances of India, and most of all, of course, upon the relations between these two great Powers. I do not demur to those self-congratulations. I think, so far as I have any right to give an opinion on the matter, that on the whole they have been well deserved. Certainly I should be the last to wish to see any reversion to the unhappy state of affairs, the bickerings and squabbling and suspicion, the frontier incidents by over-zealous officials, that used to happen between the two Powers, not in Persia only, but in other parts of Asia, before that date.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02428">But in one respect I differed at the time and still differ profoundly from, I will not say the policy, but the contents of that Agreement. I remember that the noble Viscount, in a debate we had on this matter three and a half years ago, said that in his opinion the Persian part of the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0344"/>
<col>679</col>
Anglo-Russian Agreement was its most admirable part. I held then, and I am afraid I hold still, that it was its least admirable and its worst part; and warmly as I sympathised with the inclusion of Persia in the terms of that Agreement&#x2014;and I may remark in passing that it was part of the policy and intention of Lord Salisbury, had he remained in power, to come to such an Agreement himself&#x2014;I held then, and I hold now, that it was a one-sided bargain, unequal and inequitable in its effect on British interests in Persia, and I further held and stated at the time that I was afraid that in Persia it would sow the seeds of certain trouble in the future. I have not altered those views, and I am afraid that there, has been a good deal of confirmation for them in recent events. If you compare the condition of Persia now with what it was before that Agreement was signed, I venture to say that it is immeasurably worse. I am not going to be so unjust as to suggest that this is the consequence of the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement. What I do say is this: that that Agreement has not arrested the decline of Persia, that in some respects it has actually accelerated it and that at this moment we are confronted with the imminent danger that under the shadow and shelter, so to speak, of that Agreement there may be consummated the very effect which it was the main object of that Agreement to avoid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02429">As I do not wish to be in the slightest degree unfair to His Majesty's Government, perhaps I may be allowed to read their own definition of what the character and objects of that Agreement were. It is contained in the Despatch in which Sir Edward Grey instructed the then British Minister in Teheran in September, 1907, to place before the Persian Government the instrument which had just been signed. This is what was to be stated by our Minister to the Persian Government&#x2014;
<quote>"The two States have, in signing the arrangement, steadfastly kept the fundamental principle in view that the independence and integrity of Persia should be respected absolutely. The sole object of the arrangement is the avoidance of any cause of misunderstanding on the ground of Persian affairs between the Contracting Parties. The Shah's Government will be convinced that the Agreement concluded between Russia and Great Britain cannot fail to promote the prosperity, security, and ulterior development of Persia in the most efficacious manner."</quote>
<col>680</col>
Of those three objects I am afraid that the second one is the only one which has been attained in any substantial degree. I do believe that the Agreement has been the means of removing much misunderstanding between Russia and ourselves in Persia. Ministers have frequently told us that owing to this Agreement there has been a warmer understanding between the two Powers, that quarrels have been avoided, and that the occupation of parts of Persia by Russia has been avoided. I do not desire to detract from any credit that may be due, to the Agreement in that respect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02430">But what I would submit to your Lordships is this, that the part played by Persia in the Agreement is also of vital importance to this country, and I am sure your Lordships will agree that the advantages of this Agreement would be dearly purchased if, while we and Russia were complimenting each other upon the degree of harmony that existed between us, Persian independence, which we were told was a fundamental principle of the Treaty, were found to be imperilled, or Persian prosperity, which is here stated to be one of its main objects, were found to have been brought to ruin. I am sure that the authors of the Agreement themselves would admit that the Agreement was concluded not merely with the excellent but selfish object of relieving the strain on our resources and on our respective frontiers, but that it was also concluded in order to give Persia a fair field for building up again her own fortunes, and, to use Sir Edward Grey's words, for promoting the prosperity, security, and ulterior development of that country. Above all, I am certain the Treaty had in view the fundamental principle of the independence and integrity of Persia. But if we look at the present condition of affairs, when we see the north of Persia in the occupation of Russian troops and a Russian force within less than one hundred miles of the capital and threatening to descend upon it, when we see the Persian Government in a state of apparent complete disorganisation, when we see a deposed and banished Monarch hovering on the frontier and threatening Civil war, above all when we read the terms of the ultimatum which has just been presented by Russia to the Persian Government, I am afraid we cannot speak very confidently about the maintenance of the independence and integrity of Persia, and the less we say, perhaps, about its prosperity and security the better.</p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0345"/>
<col>681</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02431">It may be said that those consequences have been duo in large measure to the weakness and inexperience of the Persian Government itself, to the blunders that have been made by its Ministers, and to the bad advice under which they have acted. I dare say there is a good deal of truth in that. I think the Persian Government, have made some serious mistakes. I think they were guilty of a grave error when they rejected the offer that was made to them by His Majesty's Government two years ago to lend experienced Anglo-Indian officers for training a corps of <i>Gendarmerie</i> to preserve order in the southern part of the country. It may be that their officials have been sometimes tactless and ill-advised, and it may be, too, that in their relations with Russia in the country they may have shown insufficient regard for the susceptibilities or the predominant influence of that great power. That may be. I do not know that it is. But if it is I suspect then: is a good deal to lie said also on the other side. I doubt very much whether the attempt of Persia to build up a Constitional Government for herself has received any overwhelming marks of sympathy or encouragement from Russian subjects in Persia. And when the Persian Government saw, as they did a little while ago, the ex-Shah, of whom they had got, rid and who was interned in Russia under guarantees to prevent his re-entry into Persia, escape there from and return in the thinnest of disguises by means of Russian railways and Russian steamers for hundreds of miles, with arms packed up as mineral waters, to invade the country from which he had been expelled&#x2014;although I entirely accept the assurance of the Russian Government that they had no connivance in that&#x2014;it is not much to be wondered at if the Persian Government felt that such steps could not be taken without the complicity, at any rate, of some Russian subordinates in the course of these transactions. That is all I have to say of the past. I do not think it is our business to try and apportion praise or blame.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02432">What we have to deal with is the situation now before us. The condition of affairs I have been describing culminated in the presentation of the first Ultimatum in the opening days of last month. There were two Ultimatums, as your Lordships know, one after the other. The first Ultimatum arose out of a petty matter in which some Persian <i>gendarmes</i> were sent to seize the property of a defaulting Persian
<col>682</col>
subject, who was, as a matter of fact, a brother of the ex-Shah and was engaged with him in his invasion of the country. There occurred a regrettable collision between these <i>gendarmes</i> and some officials sent by the Russian Consul-General who felt that he had an interest in the matter. I do not wish to discuss the merits of the affair. It was a very insignificant matter, and that it was not very serious was, I think, shown by the statement, if true, that the action of the Russian Consul-General was not supported by the Russian Minister. Nevertheless the Russian Government presented an Ultimatum and threatened to send troops into the country. His Majesty's Government, in these circumstances, advised compliance and an apology on the part of the Persian Government. So far as I am at all acquainted with the facts, I think that that advice, though it may have been unpalatable to the Persian Government, was probably wise, and I do not desire to criticise it. But only a few days later, when this cloud had barely rolled by, we read that a second Ultimatum was presented to Persia by Russia, which contained the following terms&#x2014;I take them from an answer given by the Under-Secretary in the other House&#x2014;
<quote>(1) The dismissal of Messrs. Shuster and Lecoffre; (2) an undertaking not to engage in the service of the Persian Government, tiny foreigners without the previous consent of the British and Russian Legations; (3) the payment by Persia of the expenses of the present Russian military expedition.</quote>
Those are the terms of the Ultimatum. Now a word or two as to its cause and character. The cause is stated to have been the action of Mr. Shuster in circulating in Persia a document drawn up by him, which was published some time ago by <i>The Times</i> in this country, and which contained strong and unpleasant remarks about the policy of Russia in Persia, and also, I may add, about ourselves. I do not know if this statement was officially issued either by Mr. Shuster or the Persian Government to the Press in that country. It has been denied in the newspapers that it was. If it was so circulated I agree that it was a foolish and provocative act. I think there is evidence to show that Mr. Shuster, who is a very fearless and independent man, and who has, I believe, acted throughout with a single and disinterested desire to do his duty to the Government he was serving, has shown an unfortunate lack of acquaintance with diplomatic usage and diplomatic language on occasions, and has sometimes
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0346"/>
<col>683</col>
been both impulsive and unwise. These, so far as I can gather, are the facts of the case. Still, my Lords, was the action of Mr. Shuster in circulating this pamphlet, supposing it was true that he did circulate it, really a sufficient excuse for an armed occupation of Persia by a foreign Power? Was not this second Ultimatum, following immediately upon the satisfaction of the first, rather a harsh measure? Was not the term of forty-eight hours grace a very brief period to give to a weak and helpless Power? Were not the whole of these proceedings of a most peremptory and precipitate character?</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02433">Now as to our degree of responsibility. The words which I read just now show to your Lordships that one of the leading features of the Ultimatum was a demand that involved future action by the British Legation at Teheran&#x2014;that is to say, of course, by the British Government. Now, His Majesty's Government cannot wash their hands of all responsibility for this Ultimatum, for we were told by the Undersecretary in the House of Commons only two days ago that the Ultimatum was shown to them before it was sent, and that they expressed the opinion, in reply, that we could not object to the demands respecting Mr. Shuster, to which I do not want further to allude, or to the demand regarding the appointment of foreign advisers. Therefore, in giving that answer we assumed general responsibility for the Ultimatum, because we participated in the demand. We did not present it, but we certainly associated ourselves with it, and we have since confirmed our policy of association by advising the Persian Government to accept it. The only point on which we appear to have made any protest, so far as I know, was that we made representations to Russia about the very harsh and cruel condition that Persia should pay the expenses of the invasion with which she was threatened. I hope that His Majesty's Government are persisting, and persisting successfully, in those representations, and I hope that if troops do enter the country Persia at least will not be called upon in her enfeebled and impoverished condition to pay for them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02434">What have been the consequences of this Ultimatum? They were what, I think, might have been expected. The Persian Government, which is inspired by very strong national feelings, and which
<col>684</col>
has behind it, so far as I can judge, the support of the great centres of population and all sections of the community in Persia, declined to yield. They felt that a serious blow was being dealt at their independence, and I am afraid that it is not a very consoling thing to us to read in the newspapers that the agitation which is now going on in Persia is especially directed, not at the threatening or invading Power, but at Great Britain, that a boycott of British goods has been proclaimed at Ispahan and Shiraz, that British officials have been parted with, and that great bitterness exists in English banking and commercial circles. Thus it would appear that while Russia has issued the Ultimatum, we seem to have incurred the odium. I cannot think that this testifies to a very happy diplomacy. It throws rather a lurid light upon the halcyon days we were led to expect when the Anglo-Russian Agreement was signed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02435">There is much more at stake really than the incidents or emotions of a passing crisis. I want your Lordships to be good enough to consider for a moment the terms of this particular demand in the Ultimatum that in future the Persian Government is to appoint no foreign officials without the consent of the British and Russian Governments. When His Majesty's Government assented to this demand, I wonder if they realised what it meant? Under the guise of a perfectly laudable desire to prevent friction between Russia and ourselves, does it not mean a denial, or, at any rate, a serious infringement of Persian Sovereignty? Can it be contended that a Government which is not at liberty to appoint its Civil servants without the consent of other Powers is really an independent Government? I wonder if there is an independent Government in the world on whom such an embargo has ever been placed. Can we reconcile this with the terms and the protestations of the Anglo-Russian Agreement? If His Majesty's Government say that Persian independence has gone, then their position is entirely logical. But supposing they take the position that Persian independence still exists, then it seems to me that to place these fetters upon it is really to practise a policy of self-deception which takes in nobody but yourselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02436">Let us see how this particular demand in the Ultimatum will work out in practice.
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0347"/>
<col>685</col>
The Persian Government has had the greatest difficulty in obtaining foreign officials for its service. It has applied for Italians and Swedes, and I believe in both cases it has been refused. What, then, will be the consequences? Does it mean that in future only Russian officials are to be appointed in the Russian sphere in order to satisfy the Russians, while British officials only are to be appointed in the British sphere to satisfy ourselves? I am sure the noble Viscount will deny that it has that meaning, but I venture to say that in practice that will be found to be the natural and inevitable consequence. Three years ago I based my main objection to this Agreement on the ground of the startling disparity in size, importance and significance of the two spheres. The noble Viscount is perfectly familiar with the argument. You have as the British sphere a small triangle of territory in the southeast corner of Persia adjacent to the Indian frontier, selected solely for strategical reasons, deficient in commercial importance, possessed of only one considerable city and of only one trade route. The whole of the west, north-west, north centre, and north-east, in fact the great bulk of the country, containing a large population and all its trade, is within the Russian sphere. If the Agreement means, in time, I do not say at once, that Russian officials only are to be appointed where foreign officials are appointed in the Russian sphere, whilst only British officials, less, perhaps, than half a dozen, are to be appointed in the British sphere, you will see what a serious step you are taking towards the certain and ultimate partition of Persia itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02437">Whichever way we look at it, we are moving, however unconsciously, however unwittingly, in the direction of partition. When the Agreement was concluded three years ago the Secretary of State, when he was challenged with its probable consequences, was most particular upon this, that it was only economic partition in these spheres&#x2014;that these were to be spheres in which each of us were not to contest the commercial concessions or occupations of the other Power. So far so good; but now, if this is persisted in, you advance from economic to administrative partition. From administrative partition you must inevitably go on, because these officials must exercise political influence, to political partition, and from
<col>686</col>
political partition you will advance to geographical partition. By this logical and, I am afraid, inevitable advance you will find that you are proceeding on this downward and slippery path towards the very goal which you most of all desire to avoid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02438">I am sure I need not argue at any length in your Lordships' House the unhappy results that will ensue from any such i partition. Your Lordships know well enough that, if you bring the Russian frontier down into close contact with the British frontier, you do the very thing which for the last hundred years we have been spending money and men in order to avoid. You practically do away with the whole policy of buffer States. You bring your strategical frontier, which you fixed in Seistan and Baluchistan, right into the heart of Persia, a frontier which can only be defended at the cost of a great burden on Indian finances and of an inevitable addition to the Indian Army. I do not believe that there is a single | person in the country who desires that; consummation. I am quite; certain it is i repudiated by every member of His i Majesty's Government; but what I fear is that, all unawares, you are moving, sliding, drifting in the direction which I have described.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02439">I want to say one word about the threatened occupation of Persia by Russian troops. We have been told in another place that the Russian Government have given the most categorical assurances of the temporary and provisional character of their occupation. I entirely accept those assurances. I cannot believe that Russia can seriously want that her troops should be embarked on this campaign. But I must utter this word of caution. Does not experience show to us that temporary and provisional military occupations in weak countries by European Powers tend, by a sort of fatal law, to prolong and perpetuate their own existence? As we all know, we went into Egypt for the first time with an armed force in 1882 with the idea that our occupation was to be purely provisional and that our retirement was to be speedy. Successive Governments laid that down as a principle of their policy for years. And there we are to-day. The chain has gone on lengthening and strengthening ever since, and it is one from which we cannot, even if we would,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0348"/>
<col>687</col>
escape. You find an illustration in Persia itself at the present moment. Three or four years ago the Russians entered into a military occupation of the north and north-west part of the country which was to be purely provisional and temporary. Yet 3,000 soldiers are there now and have been there ever since. Moreover, one must remember that, however sincere and honourable the intentions of the Russian Government may be, there does exist in Russia, and still more among Russian agents and Nationalists in Persia, a very strong party who openly advocate; the partition of Persia by Russia and who are anxious for nothing more than that Russia should find her way down to the Persian Gulf, and you may be certain that that party&#x2014;whether it is a strong one or not I cannot say&#x2014;will throw all the obstacles they can in the way of the retirement of the Russian troops. There is this further point. If we may judge from experience elsewhere, is it not the almost invariable case that when an army of occupation is withdrawn it seldom withdraws without exacting some very substantial <i>quid fro quo</i> from the country whose territories it has occupied and which it will not evacuate without consideration? I hope my argument has been clear in bringing us to the point that it is extremely desirable that this military occupation, however provisional it is intended to be, should not take place at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02440">The danger is not limited merely to the military occupation. This morning I read a telegram from <i>The Times</i> Correspondent at Teheran commenting on the situation. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"Russia will probably lie forced to take over the administration and to disband the Mejliss&#x2026;This would raise a delicate and difficult question with her partner Great Britain, since Russia would thus become responsible for the central government of all Persia. The <i>Entente,</i> to be preserved, must be put on a new basis, and the two Powers must establish either a dual control or separate Protectorates."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02441">My Lords, those words are most serious. I do not know if they have any authority, but they are tremendously, almost appallingly, serious, in their diagnosis of the situation. They imply that the position in Persia is worse than anything I have sketched. They appear to contemplate an assumption by Russia of a share of government, in that country which is wholly incompatible with its independence, or, alternatively, an assump-
<col>688</col>
tion of government by us in conjunction with Russia which I am sure His Majesty's Government and every one of us would I be most loth to undertake. They imply I also that the <i>Entente</i> between Russia and ourselves, which we are anxious to accept as a permanent feature of our policy, can only be maintained by the sacrifice of the principal objects for which it was created.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02442">In this very delicate and troubled situation, may I suggest that the criterion which the British Government and the British people should apply in the matter should be, not merely the stability of European alliances, but the good of Persia itself? Look at the position in that country. During the last four years the I Persian Government have had to create a Parliament, to evolve a Constitution, to suppress rebellion, to depose a tyrant, and to expel him when he returned. They have passed through a long chapter of anarchy and assassinations, they have had two Ultimatums presented to them in a fortnight, and foreign troops are even now within swooping distance of Teheran. In these circumstances, wherein lies the hope of Persia? What is it we can do for Persia itself? The Government are as anxious about this as I am. The hope of Persia at this moment does not lie in any further humiliation of that country, it does not lie in any division of spheres of interest between Great Britain and Russia, and least of all does it lie in any forcible suppression of that spark of nationality which the worst misfortunes and the greatest blunders of the Persian Government have not sufficed to extinguish. It does lie in common action between Great Britain and Russia. That is quite clear. Yes, but it must be common action in which we are loyal, not merely to our Russian allies, but also to our Persian friends. This is not the time to talk of stability or the continuance of the Anglo-Russian Agreement. We must assume that. It is the time to show that that Agreement can be made effective in the interests of Persia itself. I am quite sure we shall not impress them with our desire or ability to come to their assistance if our interpretation of the Agreement is merely that we follow silently and meekly in the footsteps of our allies. By all means let us be loyal to our obligations, but do let us show the Persian Government and people also that we have a definite policy

of our own, and that that policy combines the three features for which we have always contended and to which I hope we shall still adhere&#x2014;firstly, the continued independence of Persia; secondly, the avoidance of partition in any form; and, thirdly, the maintenance, it may be under different conditions&#x2014;because I think some change will probably be required&#x2014;but the maintenance, so far as is possible, of Constitutional Government, which, whether it be good or bad at the present moment, docs undoubtedly reflect the sentiments and aspirations of the Persian people as a whole.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02443">Before I conclude, I would like to submit to your Lordships that it is possible, nay, I think it is necessary, to take an even wider view. I have spoken of the obligations which are imposed upon us towards Persia by our old traditional friendship with that country, by the proximity of our frontiers to its frontiers, and by the great stake we have in the commerce, industries, and finances of Persia, arid, of course, by our undertakings under the Anglo-Russian Agreement. Rut I venture to say that we have larger obligations as well. Persia is a Mahomedan State. It was once one of the great and powerful Mahomedan States of the world. Most of those countries seem to have fallen in recent yews upon evil times. Ultimatums, usually with only forty-eight hours' grace, rain upon them like hailstones from heaven. I should like to see England hold up an occasional umbrella against this storm. We cannot lose sight of the tremendous law of interaction in the Mahomedan world. You strike at one part of it and the sort of nervous shock which you set up runs through the whole frame and is very likely perceptible at the other end of the globe. We cannot be insensible to this sort of world-wide commotion. Let me give two illustrations which have a direct bearing on this question. Two days ago I received a telegram of encouragement and benediction from Lucknow, which was once the capital of a Shia Mahomedan dynasty, and is still the centre of a great Shia Mahomedan population. They are watching these happenings in Persia, they feel for their co-religionists in that country, and they want to know what the British Government is doing in the interests of Persia. Directly after I got this telegram there happened to walk into my house an officer who has been serving lately upon the extreme northern frontier
<col>690</col>
of India. Among the small States that are lost in the mighty folds of the Hindu Kushi, one to which he is attached is inhabited by a small Shia population with a Shia chief. He told me that whenever he-went to see this chief, informed by the newspapers and telegrams which actually circulate nowadays even in that part of the world, the first question put to him was, "What is going on in Persia? What is being done, by Great Britain for the Shias in Persia? "These stories are indicative and eloquent. I do not want to exaggerate their importance, but they show the interest that is taken in this question, not in Persia alone, but by the whole of the Mahomedan population in all parts of the world.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02444">There is one thing of which I am convinced, that if, in your policy in Persia, however unwittingly, you appear to connive at the frittering away of Persian independence you will alienate millions of Mahomedans, many of them our fellow-subjects, in the Eastern World. I apologise it I have shown any emotion in drilling with this question, but it is a matter which I have studied at first hand and on which I feel most deeply. I do not think f have said anything with the spirit or essence of which the noble Viscount will disagree. I have made some criticisms which no doubt he will reply to. I appeal to him for some clear intimation, if it can be vouchsafed, of the course the Government are taking, mid, above all, I ask him and his colleagues and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to use the weight, the power, and the enormous influence of Great Britain in Asia to resuscitate, if it may be, and not to extinguish the poor, the flickering light of Persian independence. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02445"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the state of affairs in Persia.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Curzon of Kedleston.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02446"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all aware that there is no member of this House who can speak upon Persia with such knowledge and experience of all that hangs upon the situation in Persia as the noble Earl. He is quite right when he expects that I shall rind little fault, or I may say none, with the spirit or essence of what he said. All he has said about the reflex influence of any of our transactions in Persia upon our Mahomedan subjects in India and elsewhere is of the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0350"/>
<col>691</col>
highest importance. His Majesty's Government is fully alive to that, and that is one of the guiding elements in their considerations. Then the noble Earl offered some criticisms which were perfectly lawful, but I am not sure that they were well founded. But he was perfectly right, and he did us in the Government no more than justice when he said that lie believed that the good of the people of Persia and the stability of the Government of Persia with which the good of the people was involved, art; as much at heart with us as they are with, himself.<lb/>
It would be a great wrong if we were to buy the stability of the Anglo-Russian Convention at the price of the unhappiness and the confusion and sterilisation of all reform and progress in Persia. The noble Earl does us no more than justice when he relieves us of any charge of that kind. In a great deal of what he said the noble Earl painted a lurid picture of possibilities that may come as the result of the present situation in Persia&#x2014;from the policy of Russia on the one hand and ourselves on the other in regard to it. I am sure the noble Earl knows as well as any of us that all the mischiefs and difficulties that confront us to-day in Persia really do not come out of the Anglo-Russian Convention. He knows well that they spring from the nature of the case. Now what was the case? The experiment of Constitutional Government was tried in Persia, and everybody, even those who are most sceptical as to Constitutional Governments working well in Oriental countries, felt that here at all events, in a community like that of Persia, there was a good chance. But let me point out to your Lordships and to those outside Parliament who are full, and naturally full, of uneasiness and misgiving at the transactions which the noble Earl has described, that all those evils are not due to the action of Russia. They arise from the nature of the experiment that is being tried. You could not expect that the Persian Government should make a start in a new and unfamiliar system without being exposed to a great number of difficulties.<lb/>
And the difficulties&#x2014;Mr. Shuster, for example&#x2014;have not been merely difficulties with Russia, not merely excited the resentment of Russia, but they were difficulties connected with the internal play and the working of the Persian Parliament.
<col>692</col>
The Regent has found himself repeatedly face to face with what we should call enormous Parliamentary difficulties. He found himself unable to have a Cabinet capable of any constructive work whatever, sometimes even unable to get a Cabinet of any sort. It did not last for long, but there it was, and the position of Mr. Shuster was constantly one of severe tension with the Mejliss, whose Minister he was or professed to be. Nobody could expect that Persia in starting a new system of government could escape the perils to which all these reforms are liable to be exposed whore new systems founded on new and free principles are all exposed to the risk of extreme men who, whether they are Mahomedan or Christian, are carried away by a foolish logic and want to carry out the principles on which the new system was first started to all sorts of logical conclusions without any regard whatever to qualifying conditions and circumstances. The Persian Mejliss certainly did not escape that difficulty, and that has been one of the main difficulties. Let me point this out to those who are jealous and resentful of the interference of Russia. All the inherent difficulties of carrying on the work of new government in Persia would be a thousandfold increased, multiplied, and aggravated if there was active hostility on the part of Russia. The noble Earl sketched the other day what he would do if he were a Persian Minister. I am certain that what he would do if he were Persian Prime Minister would be to say to his Cabinet, "Of course we must do the best we can to maintain smooth relations with Russia in the north and with England in the south." Every member of your Lordships' House will see that that would be the first maxim of a Minister carrying on a new system in Persia. It would be madness to set up what some idealists in this country seem to think possible&#x2014;a system which would ignore the existence of Russia and the existence of England.<lb/>
The noble Earl has not dwelt so much on Mr. Shuster's line of action as I thought perhaps he might have done. Mr. Shuster, everybody now knows, is a man whose zeal, whose ability, and whose single-mindedness are beyond dispute. But the noble Earl will agree, that he has shown a considerable want of tact and that he has done what I venture to say no Persian Prime Minister ought to do&#x2014;he has ignored altogether the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0351"/>
<col>693</col>
position and indisputable claim of Persia's two great neighbours. He has admitted that he has had every handicap by want of knowledge of the language, the habits, and the feelings of the people of Persia. That, of course, is a tremendous difficulty and naturally ought to have made him very slow and cautions. The noble Earl referred to the letters of Mr. Shuster, and here he assumed that Mr. Shuster was not responsible for their circulation. He has not quite mastered the circumstances. Mr Shuster wrote, as we all know, a long, elaborate communication to <i>The Times</i> throwing great obloquy upon Russia and some upon ourselves. He then had the communication translated into Persian and gave it to a few Persian friends, who asked him if he had any objection to publishing it. He replied, "Of course not. What did I send it to <i>The Times</i> for except for publication?" Is it not obvious that the composition of the document, the deliberate translation of it into Persian, and the parting with it in that way was tantamount to circulation just as much as if lie himself had handed it out of his own door? Let the House remember that Mr. Shuster was a Persian official, and is if to be denied that Russia had serious ground of complaint when she found a Persian official throwing obloquy broadcast upon herself&#x2014;the official of one Government inveighing against the officials of another? It must be admitted that that at all events was a very serious course. Sir Edward Grey warned Mr. Shuster, through Sir George Barclay, what would follow. This communication was sent to the British Minister at Teheran before the Foreign Secretary here heard of this circulation and before Russia had said a word about it. On November 6 Sir Edward Grey said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Russian Government are sure to be annoyed by the appointment of Mr. Lecoffre, and it is not unlikely that they will defend their interests by energetic measures, which might even go so far as an occupation of Northern Persia. You should advise Shuster most strongly to do all in his power to conciliate the Russian Legation, and point out the probable, result of continued provocation on his part. He should be made to understand clearly that the Russian Government have it in their power to employ means which would seriously impede the discharge of his duties and which it would be impossible for him to withstand. He must be made to see that the Russians are sure to take measures for the protection of their own interests if administrative posts in their sphere of interest are filled by British subjects, and that His Majesty's Government cannot but deprecate such measures, as it would be contrary to the spirit of the Agreement of 1907. His Majesty's Government are obliged to avoid any displacement of
<col>694</col>
Russian influence by the British in the north, and the Russians are gaining the impression that under cover of minister's administration this is being done."</quote>
If you set any value on the Anglo-Russian Convention it is quite inevitable and desirable that a Minister here, desirous to observe that Convention both in spirit and letter and valuing it highly, should make that communication to Mr. Shuster, and it shows that our view&#x2014;the Foreign Secretary's view&#x2014;of the situation at that moment was thoroughly justified by the facts.<lb/>
The noble Earl will not think me disrespectful to him if I am rather brief; the time of the House is precious. I will answer one or two of his points and state plainly where His Majesty's Government stand in these matters to-day. With reference to the point as to consultation, the consultation which the Ultimatum requires is to be a joint consultation. Russia and England are both to be consulted. The Ultimatum is only putting into a rather more emphatic form what has hitherto been the practice, and in the thing itself there is nothing whatever unreasonable or damaging to Persia. It does not lower Persia one atom. As to Persia and the Agreement, I would like anybody who attributes all the mischief to the Agreement to make one or two reflections. The noble Earl wound up with rather a vehement denunciation, or description if you like, of military parties, and said that the effect of all these operations would be that inevitably there would be an extension of Russian occupation from the North down to the South. The military party at St. Petersburg, be it great or small, have always said of the Anglo-Russian Convention what they say to-day&#x2014;"But for the Anglo-Russian Convention we should be in Teheran to-day" It is that Convention which has improved the pacific prospects in Persia. The noble Earl spoke as if Persian independence and integrity had been the main and only object of the Convention. It was the main object, but nobody knows better than the noble Earl that Russia had been in possession of influence in Northern Persia long before.<lb/>
In framing the Convention no one has supposed and none of its framers intended the suppression and exclusion of Russia from Northern Persia. You could not expel Russia from Northern Persia. The
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0352"/>
<col>695</col>
independence of Persia would have been in far greater peril if there had been no Anglo-Russian Agreement. Some people seem to assume that Great Britain is quite free to take an effective part, even a military part. I wonder what they would think if a military expedition from India to Teheran was decided upon from a mistaken policy. Suppose that they were to say that it was our duty to take responsibility for Persian Government. I cannot imagine anything less advantageous either to Persia or, certainly, to ourselves. In what sense can it be pretended that our influence in Persia would have been more effectual if we had not had the Convention? Suppose we had come forward, suppose we did now, as the champion of the unconditional independence of Persia as a sovereign State. This would have; led to an amount of direct responsibility upon England which would be enormous, and we should be responsible for everything that goes on. If you do this you make yourself responsible for the military administration of Persia, a thing which I do not think anybody in England would favour.<lb/>
I will tell the noble Earl not only what Russia says, but what she undertakes, and it is this understanding which is the basis of our policy to-day. This is what the Russian Government say. Their object is to establish peace and normal relations with the Persian Government and the removal of all elements of discord. To this end the Russian Government propose to make certain further proposals with which we are not acquainted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02447"><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Is this a statement from the Russian Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02448"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: No, not exactly, not <i>literatim et verbatim;</i> but it is practically a declaration of their undertaking. That is what it comes to. I take the responsibility of that. It is not their absolute wording. The Russian Government assures us that it has no aim that would violate the integrity and independence of Persia. It assures us categorically, and desires to place on record that such military measures as it has taken in Persian territory are of a purely provisional nature, and it has no intention whatever of infringing the principles of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 as to Persia. That being of the first authenticity and authority is a very
<col>696</col>
important assurance, and justifies us under all the circumstances in framing our policy on the assumption that that was theirs.<lb/>
As to the indemnity, it is plain that the exaction of an indemnity, whether sooner or later, would inevitably tend to deprive Persia of those very means and resources that would enable her to carry out the reforms which we all in England hope to see accomplished. The hope of His Majesty's Government is that the Russian Government after this crisis is over, will find some way of avoiding the difficulties that arise upon the point of indemnity which is undoubtedly a question of very serious difficulty. With regard to the ex-Shah, our policy is definite and unalterable. Whatever intrigues may have gone on between the ex-Shah and the subordinate agents of the Russian Government, they do not affect the desire, the intention, of the Russian Government not to support the ex-Shah if he should attempt to return to his Throne, and we for our own part have informed the Russian Government that it would be impossible for us under any circumstances whatever to recognise the ex-Shah. His Majesty's Government see no insuperable obstacle to the recognition and acceptance of any other solution which may find favour with the Government of Persia.<lb/>
I have here a few lines composed by the noble Earl the other day, and I think perhaps the House will be glad to hear what Lord Curzon said on this subject. He says he does not desire to say anything to create difficulty in the present situation, which he is quite aware is a troubled one; that there is much insecurity in Persia and difficulty in collecting revenue, and sporadic warfare going on in places where the rulers are unable to make their authority felt; and the noble Earl goes on to say that he will not admit, that European diplomacy has been a model of statesmanship. He says that he fears it seldom is, but that if the present resources of Persia were inadequate and she could obtain suitable financial assistance elsewhere he would seek that assistance. The first principle of our policy is that we should maintain the spirit and letter of the Anglo-Russian Convention; the second is that we should lose no opportunity by advice or benevolent mediation to ease the situation for the Persian Government; and the third is that if we can assist by legitimate means the Persian Government to meet their financial
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0353"/>
<col>697</col>
needs we should not interpose any unreasonable obstacle. If all these things are taken into account, and they can get over the present acute crisis, and if Russia and England do not part company and the spirit of the Agreement is maintained, we have good reason for hoping and believing that before very long we shall see a solution of a situation which is at present full of difficulty, but which is not altogether hopeless or desperate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02449"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount opposite seemed to accuse the noble Earl of having attacked the Convention as having been the source of all evil at the present time. I did not understand that to be the noble Earl's view. What I should complain of is that full life and strength were not given to the Convention, and that it was not carried out in a proper spirit. The Convention itself, so far as it referred to the independence and integrity of Persia, is beyond praise. The point is that that independence and integrity have from time to time been attacked. I suppose the noble Viscount will say that that is not the case, but it is very strange that the Persian people themselves and our fellow-subjects in India as well as a great part of the Press that ordinarily supports the noble Viscount and his colleagues do take the view that His Majesty's Government have been very weak in the remonstrances they have made against the invalidation of the Convention. The statement that has been read out here as to the intentions of Russia is most satisfactory, and we earnestly hope that full strength and life will be put into those intentions, and that there will cease to be this policy of attacking and rendering more difficult, the carrying out of the administration of Persia by the new Government. The Convention itself got additional value because soon after it was brought about there came that change of <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> in Persia which really ought to have given extra force to the Agreement. I would ask whether we are to take it that there will be no change of policy and no fear of any of the steps being taken which were enumerated by the noble Earl and which would ultimately lead to the partition of Persia with all its disastrous consequences&#x2014;in fact, that we may safely assume that the Agreement will be the basis of our future policy. I understand that was really the effect of the noble Viscount's statement, and I certainly hope
<col>698</col>
it will be clearly understood that the Convention is going to be carried out in a proper spirit. Amongst the representations that have come from different parts of the East, it would be interesting to know whether His Majesty's Government have received any from Afghanistan.</membercontribution></p>

I do think it is very hard on the Persian Government to say that the present state of things has come about by inherent difficulties and not by outside factors. I regard with admiration the efforts made by the people of Persia to set up Constitutional Government, and I believe that if they had not been exposed to these attacks, if they had had a freer hand, they would long since have got their affairs into smooth working order. They started on their new career with two Great Powers on either side of them, with one of those Powers maintaining a garrison in their country; they had no money, and were exposed to the plots and schemes of the ex-ruler trying to regain power; and I do maintain that they were not given that support and sympathy which they had a right to expect from His Majesty's Government. I repeat my great satisfaction at hearing the statement of the attitude of the Russian Government at the present time, and I hope full effect will be given to it.</membercontribution></p>

We have received from the noble Viscount&#x2014;I thank him for it&#x2014;a most clear and explicit and, on the whole, encouraging reply, covering
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0354"/>
<col>699</col>
every aspect of the situation. There are points open to criticism, just as my remarks were open to his criticism. But I would rather on the present occasion take note of the seriousness and solemnity of the pledge emanating from the Russian Government, which was read out to us by the noble Viscount. As he said, that was a very important and a very categorical statement. I can only take it to mean that, given favourable circumstances, the Russian troops will not advance to Teheran, that a Russian military occupation will not take place, and that both Governments will address themselves to composing this matter before worse things occur. There was another feature of the Russian declaration to which I listened with great satisfaction&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02455"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl will pardon me for a moment, I do not wish it to be supposed, when he speaks of a declaration, that there was any given document.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02456"><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand. I do not want to press it at all beyond what it is, and I fully accept what the noble Viscount has said. But I am very glad, indeed, that this expression of opinion&#x2014;I will not use the word declaration&#x2014;contained something about the ex-Shah. Undoubtedly the presence of the ex-Shah on the frontier was a disturbing element, and nothing could be worse for the country than that that person should receive any encouragement whatever. It is the first condition of the independence and pacification of Persia that the ex-Shah should not return, and I am glad to hear that that view of the matter is taken by the Russian Government as well as by His Majesty's Government. I am afraid that the noble Viscount has not quite appreciated-the seriousness of the steps taken with regard to the appointment of officials. The noble Viscount said it was merely consecrating what has been the practice up to the present. If that is so, how has all this trouble arisen? But however that may be, I am glad to receive from the noble Viscount a repudiation of the idea that this joint consultation in future is to be regarded as embodying any diminution of the independent rights of the Persian
<col>700</col>
Government. I think the troubles in Persia have been somewhat unfairly attributed by the noble Viscount to the inherent difficulties of the case and to factors inside the country. That is true to a large extent, but it is not the whole truth. The fact is that Persia has not received that amount of assistance in making her new Constitutional effort that she is entitled to from this country. We have given her only our sympathy, and in some respects not even that, while she has been actively opposed in certain quarters. I am glad, however, to have the admission that Russia and Great Britain are to cooperate not only in removing any serious friction between themselves, but in advancing the interests of Persia, and if they attain that object I have no doubt the clouds will lift and we shall see the dawn of a better day.

<title>COAL MINES BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02458" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02459">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02460"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD EMMOTT)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the honour to move the Second Reading of the Coal Mines Bill. It is a large and comprehensive measure affecting the lives and safety of over a million of the workers in and about the mines of this country. It is a lengthy measure because it is, besides being an amending measure a consolidating measure. Since 1887 there has been no important contribution to mining legislation. In 1896 a Bill was passed which gave the Secretary of State further powers for the making of special rules in regard to coal dust, in regard to the care and use of explosives, and in reference to plans of mines, and it also gave workmen the right of representation at arbitrations. The provisions of that measure are incorporated; and amended in this Bill. But that was i not a general measure, whereas this is. Since 1887 a great deal of experience has been obtained with reference to our mines. The part played by coal dust in causing disastrous explosions has been generally recognised since that time. To-day deeper seams are being worked than was formerly the case; new methods of working are being employed; electricity is being used
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0355"/>
<col>701</col>
to a much greater extent than formerly, and all these new features mean new dangers.<lb/>
His Majesty's Government in 1906 appointed a Royal Commission, which made a very thorough investigation of the problems connected with our mines. They issued three Reports. The first Report dealt chiefly with the use of breathing apparatus, and it led to the passing of an Act last session called the Mines Accidents (Rescue and Aid) Act. The principal provision of that Act is incorporated in Clause 85 of the Bill which is now before your Lordships' House. The second Report of that Commission is the principal Report. It deals generally with questions of health and safety in mines, and its recommendations are the principal basis for the changes in the law proposed by this Bill. The third Report deals with matters of ventilation and with the treatment, of animals. There is one matter on which the Royal Commission were unable to come to very definite conclusions&#x2014;namely, the question of coal dust. At their suggestion a committee of coalowners arranged to make a series of experiments. Those experiments were made and a very valuable Report was issued by this committee, but still the information which is desired has not been obtained, and so now the Government have taken the matter over. They have obtained an experimental station in Cumberland and are proceeding with these experiments, but I believe some time may yet elapse before the result will be known.<lb/>
I do not think I need remind your Lordships that the results of past legislation and inspection have been marked by a very large diminution in the number of fatal accidents. If one goes back to the fifties and' sixties of last century the diminution between now and then is very marked indeed. The average of fatal accidents underground in the last few years proportionately to the number of men employed is, I should think, not one-third of what it was from 1851 to 1855, and not one-half of what it was from 1801 to 1865. But if we begin in 1872, which really marked the commencement of our modern mining legislation, and look at the figures since that year we find that the death rate for the first decade 1873 to 1882 was 2&#x00B7;24 per thousand employed; for the second decade, 1&#x00B7;81; and for the third decade, 1&#x00B7;39. That brings us down to the year 1902. Since that time I regret very much
<col>702</col>
to say there has been no improvement at all to record. Indeed the last two years have shown a great increase. That is because the death rate has been swollen by two or three of those appalling catas-trophies which threw a whole countryside into mourning and called forth the sympathy of every household in the land. As a matter of fact, I suppose the number of deaths in 1910 considerably exceeded those in any previous year, although proportionately much less than existed thirty or forty years ago.<lb/>
The miner's occupation is, and I am afraid must remain, a dangerous one. A miner, when he goes down to his work in a cage, when he walks along the underground road to the face where his day's labour is spent, and, most of all, when he is working at the actual face of the coal, is liable to a dangerous accident at any moment. In many mines he runs the additional risk of one of those terrible explosions arising either from fire damp or from coal dust, or of an outbreak of fire, and any of these may suddenly hurl him to destruction, or, what is much worse, leave him without hope of rescue to a lingering and agonising death. You may inquire how we compare in regard to fatal and other accidents with other countries. I am glad to say that, comparing this country with the United States of America, our death rate is proportionately very much smaller. Comparing our condition with Germany, it is decidedly better. Comparing it with France, I am afraid it is rather worse, with the single exception of that year in which there was the great disaster at Courri&#x00E8;res. Comparing our position with i Belgium, I regret to say that it is considerably worse; and as Belgium has mines which are very deep, which are very fiery, which are very dangerous as to structure in reference to roofs and sides, I cannot help thinking that there is some room for improvement for us. As a matter I of fact, in Clause 30 of this Bill we are adopting a suggestion which has been obtained from Belgium for the classification I of mines. The clause is simple in itself and merely gives power for a classification of mines, but the real meaning of it is that in accordance with the classification the; ventilation will be arranged. Where there is need for more air in order to keep i down fire damp it will be compulsory that o more air shall be admitted. Belgium has
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0356"/>
<col>703</col>
given great attention to this question of ventilation, and although I do not know the conditions of Belgium I think it must be partly on that account that her statistics are more favourable than ours.<lb/>
This Bill deals almost entirely with the health and safety of those employed in connection with this industry. Some contentious points in connection with mining which do not directly affect health and safety were, if I may respectfully say so, by the good sense of those interested in the trade left on one side in the discussions in another place&#x2014;I refer to such questions as weighing and check-weighing and the eight hours question&#x2014;and the Bill comes before your Lordships to a large extent as an agreed measure. Numerous points were settled by conferences, others in Grand Committee, and some few questions were left for final decision on Report. The points which were disputed both in Committee and on Report were rarely, if ever, pressed on the Report Stage to a Division. There will be few Amendments | of any substance that I shall have to ask this House to pass, and as far as I know they will all be of a non-contentious character; and there will be a good many purely drafting Amendments directed to the harmonising of the language of the Bill and to the removal of obscurities.<lb/>
So much on the general question of the Bill. I would like now to describe very briefly some of the important changes in the law which this measure effects. The Bill is in several parts. Part I deals with the question of management. Every mine, except very small ones, must be under a manager. He must give daily personal supervision, and if he is the manager of more than one mine there must be an under-manager for each mine, and in the case of the unavoidable absence of both the manager and the under-manager there must be a man appointed to take their place who is the holder of a first-or second-class certificate, and who is twenty-five years of age. There are provisions which will prevent a man being a manager of more mines than he can properly control and look after, and which will even prevent him from being the manager of more than one mine if there are more than 1,000 workers underground in that mine unless the Inspector gives his approval. The qualification for a manager is that he must hold a first-class certificate, be twenty-five years
<col>704</col>
of age, and have had five years' practical experience in a mine. The five years may be lowered to three years if he has certain recognised diplomas, but at the very least he must have had three years' practical experience in a mine. A change is made in regard to the examinations for these certificates. Hitherto there have been various boards in different parts of the country, and there has been a tendency to too great difference in the qualifications insisted upon, but by the provisions of this Bill there will be only one Board in future. That Board will consist of six representatives of the owners, six representatives of the workmen, the Chief Inspector, two Divisional Inspectors, and two men eminent in mining and scientific knowledge who are to be chosen by the Secretary of State.<lb/>
I turn now to the firemen, who have been well called the non-commissioned officers of the mine. It is their duty to inspect the mine daily&#x2014;in fact, much more often than daily&#x2014;for inflammable gases; to test the air currents, and see that the ventilation is right; to know the condition of the roofs and sides, and altogether to provide, as far as human care can provide, for the safety of the miners who are going to work. They must carry out their examinations before every shift, and if the shifts are continuous they must also make an examination at distances of time not greater than five hours. The qualification for firemen is that they must be twenty-five years of age, or, if they are younger, they must be holders of a first-or second-class certificate, and they must also have had five years' experience in a mine, two years of which must have been at the face. They have to give proof that they are qualified to make an accurate test of gas, which requires good sight and some practice, I believe, and they must also show that they are qualified to measure air currents.<lb/>
I pass from the firemen to the clauses dealing with what is known as self-inspection. There is an arrangement in our present legislation by which the miners can appoint two representatives who can themselves inspect and investigate the safety of the mines. The change that is made in regard to self-inspection is that now the report which these inspectors appointed by the miners make must be entered in a book and must be brought to the notice of the manager. One or two very serious explosions have occurred through defects
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0357"/>
<col>705</col>
which, had the manager known of them, could have been stopped, and which might, have been brought to the notice of the manager had these inspectors entered their observations in a book and had the manager read the entry. There are to be more accurate plans of mines in future, showing the levels. It will also be necessary that these plans should be made by competent surveyors&#x2014;that has not been necessary in the past&#x2014;and there have also to be separate plans of the ventilation with the intake current of air marked blue and the return current red. Plans of abandoned mines must be deposited at the Home Office, and can be reclaimed if the mine is reopened, and there are provisions to secure that there shall be solid and dependable fencing round the mouths of old and abandoned mines. So much for Part I of the Bill.<lb/>
I turn now to Part II, which I think is the most important part of the Bill. Part II deals with questions of safety. It embodies the old rules of the 1887 Act as amended, and includes the suggestions, or many of the suggestions, which were made by the Royal Commission. It would take me too long to refer in detail to all the alterations dealing with safety. In reference to the question of ventilation, I would just mention that there are some new standards set up. With regard to the intake airway, there must not be more than &#x00BC; per cent, of inflammable gas. With regard to the return airway, haulage must not take place if there is more than &#x00BD; per cent, of inflammable gas. With regard to the withdrawal of men when conditions are dangerous, the miners must be withdrawn when there is 2&#x00BD; per cent, of inflammable gas in a mine where safety lamps are used, and 1&#x00BC; where naked lights are used. There are also similar provisions setting up a standard in regard to what is known as "black damp," which consists of a condition of the air in which there is too little oxygen and too much carbon-dioxide. There are provisions in this part of the Bill dealing with safety lamps, with the winding of the men, with haulage and travelling roads, and with the question of roofs and sides, and I need hardly remind your Lordships that that is one of the greatest dangers to miners that exists. More than half the deaths in this country as a rule occur by falls of roofs and sides. There are other provisions in connection with electricity and coal dust.<lb/>
<col>706</col>
Although I will not describe them in detail, I should like to refer to a few points on which there was a division of opinion in the other House up to the Report stage of the Bill. The first question to which I shall refer is that of safety lamps. In some parts of Scotland and in South Wales where naked lights are used there are a good many small explosions. These lights are used in mines where there is no very large quantity of inflammable gas and therefore you do not have great explosions, but there are a good many men killed every year by small explosions in mines where naked lights are used. One of the provisions of this measure&#x2014;in Clause 32, subsection (1), paragraph (<i>b</i>)&#x2014;is that safety lamps must be used in any mine where there has been an explosion of gas within the last twelve months. That paragraph was the subject of considerable discussion all through the debates in another place, and there was great division of opinion among miners and among mineowners as to whether safety lamps should be made compulsory or not. The Government at the Report stage left the question open to the House of Commons; it left the House to decide for itself what it wished, and by a large majority they came to the conclusion that in such a state of things as I have described safety lamps ought to be used. I sincerely hope that that decision will be upheld.<lb/>
The next question to which I will refer is the difficult question of the two main intake airways which were recommended by the Royal Commission, but as to which the Royal Commission did not see their way to suggest that they should be compulsory. This question assumed great importance because of the Whitehaven explosion. At Whitehaven, noble Lords will remember, there was first of all an explosion, and then the mine caught fire. The explosion caused the destruction of some of the barriers which cut oil the intake airway from the return airway, and so the ventilation was very quickly short-circuited, and the return airway became full of fumes and it was impossible for the miners to escape. The poor men who were buried alive in that pit might possibly have been saved if there had been a second intake airway at some distance from the first by which they could have left the mine. There must be many old mines in which the cost of making a second intake airway would be so enormous if it were
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0358"/>
<col>707</col>
made compulsory that it would probably lead to the closing of the mine. The final settlement of this question in the House of Commons was that in regard to new seams, and, of course, new mines, there should be two main intake airways, one used for haulage and one for travelling, smaller mines and wet mines being exempted even from that provision, but this provision is not made compulsory in the final form of this clause&#x2014;Clause 42&#x2014;for old mines. Another difficult question is the question of travelling on haulage roads. In regard to that, in Clause 43 noble Lords will see that travelling is to be allowed on haulage roads where there is slow haulage and adequate provision is made for a footpath and proper refuges at every few yards distance.<lb/> Another question that caused a good deal of discussion was that of the hours of enginemen. An Amendment was put in, I believe in Committee, limiting their hours of work to eight, but this was not popular with many of the men themselves, who desired some elasticity in order that they could relieve one another on certain occasions when it was convenient that that should be done, and work longer hours one day and shorter hours another. In the clause as now printed in the Bill the general principle of eight hours is established, but subject to general regulations for exemptions in cases where exemptions seem necessary. In reference to the question of electricity, another point on which there has been a good deal of controversy, electricity is forbidden in mines where it is considered dangerous, and the inspector has power to order the discontinuance. The standard of inflammable gas which is considered dangerous when electricity is used in a mine is 1&#x00BC; per cent., that being the same amount as is considered dangerous in the case of naked lights. Finally, in regard to this part of the Bill, there are provisions in Clause 61 for the prevention of coal dust. The difficulty in this case has not been a question of principle at all but of the great cost of making a change, and that matter has been eventually met by giving five years' grace to the owners so that they need not change their tubs to the new pattern for five years to come.<lb/>
I turn now to Part III dealing with health. The whole of this part of the Bill is new. There is a disease, as your
<col>708</col>
Lordships know, which is generally called "miner's worm." It is scientifically known as ankylostomiasis. I am glad to say it has not appeared in any coal mine in this country, but it has appeared in German coal mines and in Cornish tin mines. The infection is usually carried by human excreta, and in this Bill power is given to make regulations for sanitary conveniences being universally provided both above ground and below. If that is done I should hope that this disease will never appear in the coal mines of this country.<lb/>
Another interesting clause is Clause 76, which deals with the provision of baths. The Royal Commission, in the unanimous part of its Report, recommended the provision of baths but did not recommend that they should be provided by owners. The Minority Report of two representatives of labour recommended not only that baths should be provided compulsorily by owners, but that miners should be obliged I compulsorily to use them. It appears that some miners object; you may take the miner to the water, but you cannot always make him bathe; and as the result of a good deal of controversy and correspondence about this clause the clause has finally been altered to the form which it now assumes in this Bill. Its provisions shortly are these. Two-thirds of the miners may, if they wish and agree to pay half the cost, compel the owner to provide bathing accommodation, provided the cost of that bathing accommodation is not likely to exceed 3<i>d.</i> per week&#x2014;that is to say, miners can by a two-thirds majority I compel the owner to provide the accommodation, but if they do they must agree to pay half the cost, and the owner need not provide the accommodation if the cost is going to be excessive. Passive resisters to bathing will have to pay their share provided the two-thirds majority is obtained. This is a very interesting experiment, and I shall be curious to see how it works out. In regard to the practice in foreign countries, bathing is compulsory in Westphalia, it has just been made I compulsory in Belgium, and is likely to be made compulsory in France.<lb/>
The only other clause in this part of the Bill on which I need say a word is Clause 77, which is inserted in order to prevent that painful disease which is known as fibroid-phthisis. There are certain kinds of rock which when drilled give of a fine dust
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0359"/>
<col>709</col>
which leads to this painful disease, and the provision in the Bill is that when those rocks are being drilled there must be a spray or jet of water playing on the part being drilled so that there may be no dust. Part IV of the Bill deals with provisions as to accidents. It is merely a I consolidating part of the measure, and there are only a few amendments in detail.<lb/>
In Part V, dealing with regulations, there are some new provisions. There is a new method of arbitration (replacing the older and more cumbrous method) by one arbitrator who is to be selected from a panel of arbitrators to be nominated by the Lord Chief Justice; and there are also powers in this part of the Bill to make general regulations applying to a group of mines, instead of having to make special regulations for each mine by itself. Part VI of the Bill deals with the question of employment. The age of boys underground is to be raised to fourteen&#x2014;one more step forward in the prohibition of child labour in this country; and the age of boys or girls who work in connection with the mines above ground is to be raised from twelve to thirteen. But the great question of controversy in regard to this part of the Bill was the question of pit brow women. I happen to come from Lancashire, and I must confess that my sympathies were with the pit brow women, and I admired the gallant, fight which they made. I did not see any of them, but I understand that a representative number of them came up to London to show those who were interested that they were neither deformed nor degraded nor broken down by hard work. I believe that those who came, at any rate, proved their case abundantly, and on the Report stage of this Bill in another place the paragraph which would have forbidden women to work at the pit brow in future was struck out, and an addition was made to another paragraph applying to boys, girls, and women that they were not to lift or to move too heavy a weight.<lb/>
Clause 96 deals with the question of weekly wages. That, again, is a very contentious subject, but I believe it is largely a South Wales question. In Northumberland and Durham wages are paid fortnightly and I do not think any objection is taken by the miners, who have become accustomed to and prefer the system. The only objection, of course,
<col>710</col>
on the part of owners to pay wages weekly is the expense and difficulty of computing the amount to be paid. It is rather a costly proceeding, because all the wages, as noble Lords know, are paid under what is known as a piece-work system. However, the clause which makes wages payable weekly at the option of the miners is in the Bill now, and in regard to that question, although the matter I believe was discussed in the other House on Report, no Division was taken against the Bill as it now stands. The original objection of the Government in this matter was not at all an objection of principle; it was an objection to dealing with the question of wages in what they regard as chiefly a health and safety Bill.<lb/>
Part VII deals with the appointment of inspectors and their powers and duties, and Part VIII is mainly concerned with arbitration and legal proceedings. There is only one matter in Part VIII to which I wish to call attention. There are new provisions with regard to the care and treatment of animals. The existing law is that the roads in a mine which are used for horse work or pony work must be sufficiently large for the horses or ponies to pass without rubbing, and the inspectors have power under the existing legislation to examine into the care which is exercised in regard to these animals. There are also further requirements made with regard to special rules. I dare say your Lordships will remember that a short time ago a very strong public agitation took place in regard to this matter and a good deal of feeling was aroused, and as the Royal Commission happened to be sitting at the time the Home Secretary asked them to investigate the question. They did so, and presented a valuable report. I am glad to say that they state that in their opinion some of the charges made by some of the agitators were grossly exaggerated, but they make a series of recommendations in considerable detail as to what should be done. It was the intention of the Government in the first place, as I think your Lordships know, not to put detailed regulations in the Bill but opinion on this matter in the House of Commons was so strong that a series of regulations has been put in the Third Schedule in reference to it. Horses must be tested for glanders before they are sent down into the pit. That, I am sure, everybody will agree is a very necessary and useful provision. There are tolerably minute regulations as to the stabling and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0360"/>
<col>711</col>
care of horses, and there was an Amendment put in at a very late stage that no blind horses are to be used. That is one of the questions on which people hold different opinions. Also&#x2014;this is not a matter mentioned in the Schedule in question&#x2014;an undertaking was given by the Government that the special inspectors to see that horses are properly taken care of are to be Government inspectors paid out of public funds.<lb/>
My Lords, I apologise for the time I have taken, but I have only given a somewhat hurried account of this Bill. If I had gone into more detail, it would have taken far too much time, as the considerations&#x2014;as noble Lords know who are interested in this question&#x2014;at the back of the clauses of this Bill are often of a highly technical character. The Bill has been examined with great care in another place, and it is practically an agreed Bill as far as I know. I venture cordially to recommend it to your Lordships' favourable consideration, and I have pleasure in moving that the Bill be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02461">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;(<i>Lord Emmott.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02462"><member>VISCOUNT CHILSTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust you will give me a few moments while I make some observations with regard to this Bill. I do not propose to in any way offer hostile criticism, but, on the contrary, to welcome the Bill, which, speaking for myself, I certainly consider the most useful and the most practical Bill which has been brought forward by His Majesty's Government this session. There is another reason why I think this Bill requires possibly less consideration in this House&#x2014;that is, that it has received fair discussion in another place. This Bill comes here, therefore, without those blots and oversights which are common, if not essential, in all Bills which have been closured or guillotined in another place. The Bill has been very carefully considered in a Grand Committee, which, if my memory serves me, sat for something like twenty-three days, and it has also been carefully considered on Report in another place. The Bill, as the noble Lord said, was based upon the Report of a Royal Commission. That Commission was a particularly strong one, and was backed up by the very valuable experience of the experts of the Home Office. The Bill
<col>712</col>
consists of something like 130 clauses, seventy-five of them being practically consolidating clauses, and most of the amendments which have been put in beyond the consolidation clauses were proposals which received the unanimous recommendation of the Royal Commission.<lb/>
I take some interest in this Bill, for although I had not the honour of appointing this Royal Commission, it was consequent upon a great deal of work which was going on at the Home Office when I had the privilege of administering it, and I know well what great care was taken to produce proper material upon which legislation might proceed. As the noble Lord has told us, this is the only really important Bill introduced on this matter since, I think, 1887, when my noble friend Lord Llandaff, who was then Secretary of State for the Home Department, introduced and carried the great measure of that year. I do not propose to ask the noble Lord opposite questions on points of detail, or to criticise individual clauses. I express my satisfaction especially that the Bill includes new provisions for the provision and care of winding apparatus, for signalling, and especially for the prevention of coal dust, because those are matters which were borne in upon me when I was at the Home Office as being very considerable sources of accident. The noble Lord explained to us why the Bill has not included the more controversial matters of check-weighing and eight hours. I think the Government, if I may say so, were wise in keeping those matters outside this consolidation Bill. The second, at all events, is a matter of very great controversy, and I do not mind confessing that my view is that I hope that measure may some day or another be repealed.<lb/>
The noble Lord has told us of the various clauses which deal with the health of the miner. I do not think that we can maintain that a miner's occupation is at all an unhealthy one; in fact, the death rate among miners is 3 per cent, below the average. But there is no doubt, when you come to liability to accident, that it is a very dangerous occupation. The figures I saw the other day showed that the liability to death from accidents in mines is 247 to 100 in other trades, or more than double. Indeed, I think it was the Undersecretary for the Home Department who, speaking in another place the other day,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0361"/>
<col>713</col>
pointed out that every day, summer and winter, four men or boys were brought up dead from mines, and every day some 500 men and boys received some injury. If any justification was needed for a further extension of legislation surely those figures provide it; and so far as I and noble Lords on this side of the House are concerned, the noble Lord will not encounter any opposition to the principle of this Bill. The necessity for consolidation and amendment has long been fully recognised. This is in no sense a Party question. The noble Lord said that in another place this was considered an agreed Bill, and I think he may take it that it will be, certainly in principle, an agreed Bill in this House, for its object is the bringing of health and safety to over a million of our population, and helping an industry which is essential to our commerce and which provides the motive power not only for our marine, but for half of our manufactures. I will not detain your Lordships at greater length this evening. I may have some questions to ask the noble Lord opposite when the Bill is in Committee, but I can assure him that so far as I am concerned I will use my best endeavours to promote the successful passage of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02463"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise for addressing your Lordships on a Bill of this kind, and I should not do so were it not for the fact that coal-mining is one of the main industries in the Principality from which I come. I am afraid that the statement that this is an agreed Bill will not be acquiesced in by the proprietors of collieries in my own district, some of the principal ones of whom have told me that the existence of several collieries, where the margin of profit is very narrow, will be greatly imperilled by the passing of this Bill. Of course, some of the more striking defects in this measure have disappeared in another place, but even as the Bill stands to-day I am told that it contains defects of a more than superficial character. One blot on the Bill lies in the fact that it applies to all districts without consideration of, or provision for, the very different conditions under which coal has to be worked in different districts.<lb/>
To take South Wales, the part of the country with which I am more familiar, it is the fact that we produce the best steam coal there, but the roofs are from the nature of the structure more dangerous to
<col>714</col>
the collier than in other coalfields. I think I am correct in saying that there are more deaths from roof falls in South Wales than from any other cause. I can find no more effective clause of the Bill which provides for the greater safety of the collier than Clause 42. On the other hand, Clause 43, which relates to travelling on haulage road, lays down an extra width of road, and those who are engaged in mining work in South Wales tell me that that extra width of road in their district would seriously increase the roof dangers. There are other provisions the character of which I think is rather evidenced by the fact that they are only imposed in the case of new mines. I From all I hear in my own country it does seem to me that there is reason to fear that the Bill would not substantially promote the security of the collier, whereas in some districts it would very substantially hamper the prosperity of the industry upon which his livelihood depends.<lb/>
This fear is confirmed in my own mind by past experience. Your Lordships will remember the Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1908, known as the Eight Hours Act, with regard to which we were told by Mr. Winston Churchill that any small temporary restriction would be more than counterbalanced by the general tendency to expansion, just as the recoiling wave is lost in the advance of the tide. He added that the mining population would be I benefited in respect of health and their general habits of life, and we were also I warned by Mr. Churchill against making | prophecies. The noble Viscount on the other side of the House said that he hoped to see the Eight Hours Act repealed. What has been the result of that Act? The men can only work on an average about six hours on the face of the coal; overtime, of course, is made illegal. There is this very striking fact, that wages have never been at such a high rate for so long a period in our country&#x2014;I think they are now 50 per cent, above the standard&#x2014;and yet never has there been so much unrest and discontent in the coalfields, of course owing to curtailed wages. What happens is that they are continually agitating for allowances, and hence there are perpetual frictions in the working of the mines, and the cost of working collieries has been enormously increased by the Eight Hours Act. One point, which appeals to me particularly, is the disorganisation it has led to in the collier's home. Anyone who knows colliers'
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0362"/>
<col>715</col>
houses will know how extremely hard it is on the colliers' wives. Many of them have told me that they get no rest at all owing to the disturbance in the house night and day. I repeat there is a great deal of unrest in the South Wales coalfields, and I venture to say without hesitation that one of the main causes of that unrest has been the Eight Hours Act; and if there is, as I hope indeed there may not be, a strike in the Welsh coalfields, that Act will have contributed very much indeed to the creation of the unrest which will have brought about
<col>716</col>
such a strike. It is not for me, of course, to oppose a Bill of this nature, but I must say in the face of the experience of the past that I regard the measure with some misgivings.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02473"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships are familiar with the purposes which this Bill is designed to further, because two years ago the Bill largely in its present form was before your Lordships for a considerable time. That Bill was the result of an inquiry by a Departmental Committee which took much evidence in Scotland on this subject, and the Committee itself was due to a very prolonged movement in favour of legislation on this subject. But I need not dwell upon those details as they are familiar to your Lordships. The Bill of 1909 was brought up in the month of September of that year. Your Lordships gave it your consideration, and continuous efforts were made between the two Houses to find a solution of the crucial difficulties in the proposals which were then made.<lb/>
<col>718</col>
It, may be convenient, however, if I briefly state again the purposes which these proposals are designed to serve, and also the differences between the proposals of 1909 and those in the present Bill. Before I state the grievances, I may remind the House that these grievances are felt very acutely by a part of the population in Scotland. Frequently, as your Lordships know, Scottish legislation under existing conditions has to follow English legislation on the same subject, and even in that respect Scottish interests deserve the special consideration of Parliament. All the more so then do they deserve special consideration and indulgence when they affect, not the whole of Scotland, but a small though important part of the population of that country, as is the case under the, present circumstances. The cause of the grievances which this Bill is designed to meet is to be found in the necessity which modern industrial conditions impose upon labour that it should easily move from place to place. Working men have to follow employment. When a depression of trade occurs in an industry in one part of the country it is frequently necessary for men to seek employment elsewhere, where the conditions are more favourable and industry is more prosperous. Many of the social arrangements in which working men take a part, and which affect them closely, are adapted to meet the requirements demanded by the necessity that labour should be mobile and move from place to place. Trade Unions, building societies, and other organisations of that kind adapt themselves to these conditions.<lb/>
But when we come to the tenure of houses we find a remarkable difference between the systems obtaining in England and Scotland. In England the tenure of working men's houses&#x2014;the conditions under which they were let and the conditions, therefore, under which working men could obtain dwelling houses, especially in the industrial districts&#x2014;was adapted many years ago to meet the new requirements, and what are called "short lets" are the rule. In Scotland, however, for reasons which I need not enter into or attempt to fathom, we still have long lets, yearly lets, and the consequence is that men who under the conditions I have described are obliged when industry is slack in shipbuilding, in iron works, or in the engineering trades, to leave, say, the Clyde and go to

the Tyne or to the North of Ireland to obtain occupation, frequently find themselves bound to pay the rent of the house they had taken for a large part of the unexpired year, while at the same time they are paying for the house in their new location.<lb/> There is another grievance which has grown up, for let me remind your Lordships that the letting of houses is not regulated by Statute but by custom. I refer to the grievance which goes by the name in Scotland of the "missive system," which requires a yearly tenant of a dwelling-house to bind himself about the beginning of February to take the house for a year from the following May. Your Lordships will see that under that practice a man is practically bound for sixteen months. This Bill is designed to remedy that grievance by shortening the notice to a maximum of two months. Secondly, it provides for a system of short lets; and, thirdly, your Lordships will readily recognise that as the occupier of a house is liable to pay rates the sequel of introducing a system of short lets must be to modify the system under which assessments are now paid. I hope I have placed sufficiently in detail before the House the purposes which this Bill is designed to serve.<lb/>
I would now point out a few of the main differences between this Bill and the proposals of two years ago. In the first place, to what districts is it to apply? The Bill of 1909 applied only to houses in burghs. This Bill applies not only to houses in burghs, but also to houses in what are known as special local government districts, formed under the Public Health Act, 1897, and under a series of Local Government Acts, 1889 to 1908, for the purposes of lighting, drainage, scavenging, water supply, and the like. These are populous districts, resembling in many respects small burghs, and it was at the instance of a county which contains, I think, the largest number of such districts&#x2014;namely, Lanarkshire&#x2014;that this change was made in the Bill in the House of Commons. The second difference between this Bill and the former Bill is this. A small dwelling-house in the former Bill was defined to mean in burghs of under 10,000 inhabitants a dwelling-house rented at &#x00A3;15 a year; in burghs with between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants, &#x00A3;21 a year; and
<col>720</col>
in burghs over 50,000 population, &#x00A3;26 a year. This House considered that these limits were too high, and reduced them to from &#x00A3;10 to &#x00A3;20. These limits have practically been adopted in the new Bill. They run in this Bill from &#x00A3;10 to &#x00A3;21. The provisions for shortening the missive period are the same in both Bills, as are also the provisions conferring on the landlord or the tenant a right of due notice to terminate the tenancy at any date when the instalment of rent is payable, and also the provisions simplifying and cheapening the process of removing. In these three respects, which are points of some importance, the two Bills are identical.<lb/>
I now come to what has been the main point of controversy on this subject&#x2014;namely, the provisions providing for payment and collection of assessments, with their accompaniment, the question of disqualification for the franchise. The Bill of 1909 was a compounding Bill. The owner was liable for the occupier's assessments with a right of recovery against the occupier in respect of the period of his occupation, but the franchise disqualification completely disappeared, as, let me remind your Lordships, it does in the system in vogue in England. Owners were made liable for occupiers' assessments, whether they collected them or not, but were entitled to repayment by the municipal authority or by the assessment authority if the house was unlet for part of the year. The owner's commission to cover the cost of collection and the risk of loss on assessments was left to the sheriff to fix. Those provisions were very keenly criticised, and they have led to alterations in the present Bill. It was contended then, and it is still the contention of the Government, that it is impossible to touch this question of short lets without affecting in some degree the franchise, but the proposals contained in this Bill do, in the opinion of the Government, reduce any such interference with the franchise to the very lowest minimum.<lb/>
This Bill of 1911 is designed to preserve as far as possible&#x2014;short, of course, of amending the Franchise Acts and the Poor Law Acts, which we do not attempt to do&#x2014;the franchise disqualification for non-payment of rates. It leaves the liability of rates, but only for the period of his occupancy, upon the occupier. The liability is with the occupier for the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0365"/>
<col>721</col>
period of his occupancy; but owners are made responsible, in the first instance, for the full occupiers' rates on all their houses, but they are entitled to the repayment by the assessing authorities of any rates which they have not been able to collect from the occupiers. There is, therefore, no ultimate loss to provide for&#x2014;that is to say, the owners have to bear no ultimate loss. For that reason the commission allowed is reduced in Glagsow to 2&#x00BD; per cent., varying downwards in other areas. The Bill provides that owners must make a return to the assessing authorities, on a date to be fixed between the 1st and the 20th of May, of all occupiers in arrear of rent, which necessarily includes rates, and it will be the duty of the collector of poor rates to give every occupier so reported an intimation that unless he pays the rates said to be due in respect of the house for which he appears liable on the assessment roll before the date specified, he will not be entitled to be placed on the roll of voters. That provision preserves the franchise disqualification for nonpayment of rates concerning houses in respect of which the occupier's name appears on the assessment roll. Your Lordships will remember that the provisions of the Bill of 1909 were designed to keep the occupier uninformed of the assessment; it was thought that private owners would issue to the occupiers a receipt or certificate stating the amount payable under the heads of rent and assessment respectively. This Bill does not distinguish between rent and rates, so far as the occupier is concerned. This, I think, is all that need be said at this stage in respect of the difference in the treatment of the main controversial point in this Bill. The remaining provisions of the two Bills are really identical. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02475"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think it will be necessary for me at this stage to make any prolonged remarks with regard to this Bill. But I wish to say, with regard to the grievance which the noble Lord said was felt in certain burghs in Scotland owing to the system of long lets, that there has never been any controversy on that point between the two sides of the House. [Lord PENTLAND: Hear, hear.] There has never
<col>722</col>
been any proposal from this side of the House to do anything which would interfere with the proposed system of short lets. On the contrary, we have done everything in our power to promote short lets, and I myself introduced a Bill which went into a further point&#x2014;namely, payment of rates by instalments. Therefore so far as this grievance of the lets being too long under the present system, which, as the noble Lord says, is a system not of law but of practice&#x2014;so far as that is concerned there has never been any conflict of opinion between the two sides of the House. The difference which has existed has been with regard to the effect which the Bill of 1909 had upon the law as affecting the franchise, and in regard to that I shall say a word in a moment.<lb/>
To take first the point of the special districts, which the noble Lord alluded to as having been for the first time introduced into this Bill, I do not desire to offer any objection at all to that. The population limits which he has adopted in this Bill are identical or very nearly identical to those which were approved by your Lordships' House, and there, of course, I agree with the noble Lord. But this Bill greatly extends the system of compounding, Now, I personally entertain all the objections which I entertained in 1909 to this extension of the system of compounding. In view of the present condition of affairs under which rates are being constantly increased and heaped up it seems to me most desirable, in the occupiers' interests and from the public point of view, that the occupiers should know the burden which they are called upon to bear, and it should not be disguised in the form of an addition to the rent. It stands to reason that although the demand may be imposed upon the owner, he is not going to bear the burden. He will endeavour to free himself from it by, as far as he can, making additions to the rent, and therefore the burden which the occupier has to bear is really very much the same although it is disguised from him by bearing another name. But although I entertain as much objection to this extension of the system of compounding as I did in 1909; I do not propose to move the rejection of the Bill on that score.<lb/>
In reality, the only point of controversy between the Government and those who entertain the same opinions as I do is as
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0366"/>
<col>723</col>
to the effect which the payment of the rate being imposed upon the owner instead of the occupier will have upon the qualification for the franchise. The Secretary for Scotland has already said that the Government desire to interfere with the laws relating to the qualification for the franchise as little as possible, and he also said that they did it in this Bill to a minimum degree. If any one will look at the Bill, however, he will see that the Government recognise that the liability of the occupier, so far as the franchise is concerned, ought to remain, because the proviso to Clause 7, subsection (3) reads&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that, for the purpose of any qualification or franchise which depends on payment of occupiers' assessments, an occupier shall be held to be in arrear and his assessments to remain unpaid to the extent of any claim therefor (if relating to any period during the occupancy of the said occupier) under this subsection in respect of which the owner has received repayment, or which is pending at the date when notice of occupiers' assessments in arrear requires to be given under the statutes relating to such qualification or franchise."</quote>
And that is repeated, or, at least, it is alluded to in terms of the same sort in Clause 8, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that where an owner who is responsible therefor omits or neglects to pay any such assessment, or where, having paid the same, he has claimed repayment thereof in respect of any period during the occupancy of the said occupier, the occupier may pay the same to the assessing authority and deduct the amount from the rent due or accruing due."</quote>
That enables the occupier to save his vote by himself making a direct payment of the rates. I quite admit that this arrangement is far better than the arrangement in the former Bill. But if I read this Bill correctly, the grievance is not fully met by the words as they stand, though I think that words might very easily be devised to meet the objection which I entertain. That objection is this, that under a system of short lets, a man may occupy, we will say, five houses&#x2014;A, B, C, D, and E&#x2014;within twelve months. Then the assessor calls upon him when he is occupying house E. All he has to prove is that the rates in respect of house E have been paid, whereas it is quite possible that in houses A, B, C, and D he may not have paid his rent, and has not, therefore, fulfilled the conditions of the franchise. I am, of course, putting an extreme case for the sake of making my argument clear, but I think words might be easily devised to
<col>724</col>
meet that case, because the intention of the Government is exactly the same as mine&#x2014;namely, that during the whole of the twelve months the rates due shall have been paid by somebody, either by the owner on behalf of the occupier, or, under the working of Clause 8, by the occupier himself directly. I think that is all I need say on the Bill at the present stage, and I have no intention of opposing the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02476"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to make quite clear our attitude on this side of the House in regard to this Bill. When the Bill came up to your Lordships in 1909 its principle was accepted on both sides of the House, and my attitude to-day in regard to the Bill is the same as it was in 1909. I accept its principle, and I go further and admit there is a grievance, and I am glad to support anything to remedy that grievance. But I do regret to see that this Bill again contains this obnoxious system of compounding. I call it obnoxious because, having had some experience of municipal government, I take a somewhat strong view on this question. Your Lordships have only to look at the great increase in municipal expenditure all over the country to recognise the absolute necessity of bringing home to the ratepayer his personal responsibility in regard to the rates levied. Moreover, I do not believe that the evils attendant on compounding are a necessary part of this Bill. The Corporation of Glasgow put forward an alternative scheme last year, and, as another alternative scheme, I see no reason why an owner should not be forced by law to state separately on his demand note how much of the amount demanded is for rent and how much is being collected as rates for the local authority. In any case, accepting the view that this principle of compounding is an integral part of this Bill, which I do not believe, it would remove some of the evil.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland will correct me if I am wrong, but this Bill, as I read it, is going to take away the power which is at present possessed by assessing authorities of granting exemptions to those poorer occupiers who may find themselves unable to pay municipal rates. [Viscount ST. ALDWYN: Hear, hear.] I have read the Bill very carefully
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0367"/>
<col>725</col>
and it seems to me that there is no doubt on this point. What happens is this. The owner is responsible for the occupier's assessment; therefore, when he collects the rent every week he fixes the sum which represents the occupier's proportion of rent and rates. If the occupier had an exemption, how would the owner recoup himself for the loss which he had sustained by paying the occupier's assessment to the local authority. As I read this Bill, he can only obtain repayment of rates in respect of rent which he has not received. I think that is quite clear, and it is equally clear that these occupiers will, in future, however poor they may be, be unable to obtain any exemptions in regard to rates.<lb/>
I wish to support my noble friend Lord Camperdown as regards what he said about the enfranchisement of people who did not pay their rates. I am quite sure that His Majesty's Government did not intend to bring in any form of franchise measure, but under this Bill it is possible for a man to get on to the register simply because he has paid his rent and his rates for one month in respect of the house in which he happens to be residing when the voters' roll is made up. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland shakes his head, but I read the Bill in that way. During the previous eleven months of the year the man may have been in successive occupation of several houses in the same constituency, or in different constituencies if it is in a large burgh such as Edinburgh, or Glasgow, or Aberdeen, and in respect of those houses he need not have paid a single penny of either rent or rates. I do not think it can be the intention of the Government&#x2014;certainly I do not think it desirable&#x2014;that under those circumstances a man should find his name on the register. I am not going to detain your Lordships further. I support the principle of the Bill, but I do not believe that in its present form it will be altogether acceptable to the class in whose interests it is drawn up. I think they may very likely find themselves having to pay increased rent for the houses which come within the scope of the Bill. The owner adds his rates and rent together, but he adds something more to safeguard himself against any possible loss which may accrue from non-collection of rates. The result will be that the hard-working, thrifty artisan, the man who is willing to pay his way, will have to pay an increased rent in order to recoup his landlord for any possible
<col>726</col>
loss due to defaulting tenants. I would like to say to the noble Lord once more that we do support the principle of this Bill; but the provisions of Clause 7 as regards rating require some alteration, and I trust that the Government will see their way to meet us in regard to some of the points which we may think it necessary to raise when we consider this Bill in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02477"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to say a few words in reply to the points which have been put to me, and to endeavour to give the noble Lords who have spoken the information which they desire. The noble Earl who has just sat down pointed out that the provisions of this Bill, if carried into law, may produce this result, that the inhabitants of these houses may have to pay, on the whole, increased rents for the privilege. That may very possibly be a result, but that has been considered and faced by those who are interested in this matter. These men have not the means to make long, heavy payments, and, as your Lordships know, many social contrivances are devised to meet the needs of working men in these respects. The instalment system, however burdensome it may seem to us, does meet hardships and conditions or it would certainly not be in existence. It is very widely in existence, and it is in full knowledge of what may be the effects of this Bill that the pressure for some remedy such as that which this Bill is designed to give has been applied. It has been in existence in Scotland for twenty or twenty-five years. Ten, fifteen, or twenty Bills have been introduced into Parliament in the effort to obtain relief, and I think your Lordships may be assured that those who have been inspiring and supporting this movement for all these years are well aware of the probable consequences, and have measured the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the change which they seek to bring about.<lb/>
The noble Earl took another point on which I should like to say a word. Under the Poor Law Acts in Scotland payment of rates at present must be payment for the whole year. Now, if you are going to give to working men the option of taking a house for periods shorter than a whole year&#x2014;they are now, as I have explained, obliged to take houses for a whole year, so that the payment of rates and the payment of rent are concurrent obligations&#x2014;but if your Lordships are going, as you have expressed your willingness to-day, to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0368"/>
<col>727</col>
give working men the option of taking houses for one month, or two months, or three months, it stands to reason that you cannot possibly avoid interfering with the present obligation to pay rates for the whole year. I hope I have made that clear to your Lordships, because this is cardinal to this whole discussion. It is from this unavoidable necessity with which we have to deal that springs the whole difficulty, and if we do not at the beginning recognise that it is an unavoidable duty forced upon us by the necessity of an alteration we cannot ultimately arrive at that agreement at which, I willingly recognise, your Lordships are desirous to arrive. From that follows the necessity of in some degree touching the franchise, because, while it is not the main qualification for the franchise, the payment of rates is a subsidiary qualification. The main qualification for a person to be placed on the voters' roll is a residential qualification&#x2014;having been in residence in Scotland for twelve months previous to the 31st of July.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02478"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: And having paid rent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02479"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: In a constituency, you mean. You said in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02480"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am thinking of the law in Scotland. The noble Earl is quite right, but I am putting aside the special condition of the constituency for a moment. The residential qualification is the main qualification for the franchise. Having paid rates is a subsidiary qualification, quite as essential, I admit, but subsidiary. Now if you are going to interfere with the present law which obliges payment of rates in one sum for the whole year, you must consequentially touch in some degree this subsidiary qualification for the franchise. I do not state that in any controversial sense because it is the basis of our whole discussion.<lb/>
Now let me say one word in regard to what the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, said about the payment of one month's rates, in exceptional circumstances, qualifying a man for a whole year. The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, said something of the same kind. I will discuss that fully in Committee. But let me put it to your Lordships that you are really considering
<col>728</col>
exceptions. The main body of the people for whom this remedy is established and proposed in this Bill are men who faithfully discharge their obligations. They pay their rent and their rates regularly, but by the force of circumstances in having to seek their employment elsewhere they leave a district and go to work for their living in another district. In nine eases out of ten, I might almost say in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, these men go off the roll because their residential qualification is interrupted. Numbers of them may move within the same constituency, but a great many will go out of a district altogether, and their franchise would be lost to them under the present law, not because they had not paid rates, but because their residential qualification was interrupted. I therefore put it to your Lordships that the controversy, such as it is, between us is really within very narrow limits as to what would happen in the case of a very small number of men.<lb/>
Let me state, even in regard to this very small minority, what happens. The assessment roll in Scotland is made up from the valuation roll, and from the valuation roll is made up the register of voters. Take the case of a man who is in occupation of a house in September or October, when the register of voters is made up. The assessor who makes up the register of voters looks at the valuation roll and sees a particular man's name entered on the roll opposite the house which he occupies, and he puts him upon the register of voters in respect of that house. The time comes when the rating notes, or what we call the assessment notes, are sent out, in December. The Poor-law authorities and the other local authorities send out their assessment notes for the rate from the following Whitsuntide for the year. In January they begin to press for the payment of that rate. In May the notices are sent out to defaulters, and they have to pay by the 15th of June or they are struck off the register of voters, which begins to be made up in June, July and August. The noble Earl says that a man may be put on the roll when he has only paid rates for a month. That is perfectly true. He may have been on the roll for a month, because when he pays lie pays for his occupancy. Under this Bill we cannot any longer ask him to pay for the year. Before you established short lets you asked that man in January to pay his rates for the whole year; but when you
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0369"/>
<col>729</col>
once begin telling that man that he can leave his house in a month&#x2014;that is what this Bill does, and that is what your Lordships say you are in favour of, the giving of short lets&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02481"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Will not the owner be called upon to pay the rates for the whole year? The occupier will not be called upon, as I understand, under the Bill to pay the rates at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02482"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl will allow me to go on, for the sake of simplicity I think it will be better. The noble Earl is quite right; but the owner has a right of recovery, so it comes to the same thing. We are dealing with the occupier who is only in residence for a short time, and that is the point I wish to make. When you have a system as at present, that rates should be paid for the whole year, that matter is simple enough. If the man does not pay the rates legally payable for the whole year he is struck off the register; he becomes a defaulter and does not get a vote. But if you introduce a system of short lets and say to a man, "You may break the tenure of your house, you may go to Belfast, or Sunderland, or Gateshead, or North Shields, or wherever your employment takes you, you may break your tenure after, it may be, one month, or two months, or three months." you must free him also from the obligation to pay rates for the whole year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02483"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Why?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02484"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That is where your difficulty comes in. The noble Earl at once says that he suspects something. He says, "Oh, I have caught you extending the franchise." That is I he real difficulty; but I would urge upon you that we have done our best to reduce this objection to the very narrowest limits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02485"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Oh&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02486"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl says "Oh"; but I would ask him to balance against it the great injustice which people in Scotland in this position are now suffering, and to remember that thirty years ago in England Parliament was obliged, after abandoning compounding, under much wider limits than are contained in this Bill&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

I can only say that in working out any improvement of this Bill the Government will welcome the co-operation of noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02490"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: May I, by permission of the House, say one word for the purpose of clearing my own mind and possibly the minds of some others on this side of the House? The noble Lord says he does not interfere with the residential qualification, but he does propose to interfere with the condition that rates must have been paid during the preceding twelve months. I do not quite understand on what principle he proposes to alter the one and not to alter the other. Nor do I think it, really will be found possible to do so. As Lord Dunmore and I said, it will be quite possible for a man to be put upon the roll when he has only occupied a house and paid rates in respect of it for one month, or possibly for one week. During the preceding twelve mouths he may have lived in five or six other houses. The law as it stands says that the rates must be paid during the whole of the preceding twelve months. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland says the alteration proposed is a very slight alteration; but surely it is a very considerable alteration when you say that a man may be placed on the voters' roll in respect of having paid rates for only one week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02491"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: May I, by leave of the House, say a word on that point? It is a hypothetical case. As a matter of fact, landlords will not take a man who has been in six or seven houses in a year and has not discharged his obligations. The odds are that in practice they will not take such a man. When a man goes to them for a house, especially a man who desires it for a short time, they will inquire as to his antecedents and where he has been living, and such cases as Lord Camperdown mentions are not likely to happen, though they are quite possible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02492"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord says it is a hypothetical case, but that is only an assertion of his own; it is not an argument. It is in the very western towns, where this system appears to be most desired, where the greatest number of changes will take place. With regard to the residential qualification, the noble Lord says you cannot require a man to pay the rates for the year. Well, in the same way you may say you cannot require a man to reside for twelve months. I do not wish to pursue the subject further, but I think it is a matter that can be easily arranged. I believe I can put down words which will satisfy the Government, and I

<title>PIER AND HARBOUR PROVISIONAL ORDER<lb/> (No. 4) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02509"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before asking your Lordships to suspend the Sessional Order as regards this Bill, it is only right that. I should state the reasons which make this Motion necessary. The negotiations with regard to the Bill have been very difficult. The local inquiry was held as far back as March. 23 last, but no Order could be made before June 29. The Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on July 21, and since then no time has been lost with regard to it. The Board of Trade are very anxious to complete the Order, winch has been an unusually difficult one but is now not opposed. I venture, therefore, to ask your Lordships to make an exception in this case and allow me to move the suspension of the Sessional Order so far as this Bill is concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02510">Moved, That the Order made cm the 29th day of March last. "That no Provisional Order Confirmation Bill brought from the House of Commons shall be read a second time after the 4th day of July next," be dispensed with, and that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Granard.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02511"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a very unusual request, even after the explanation of the noble Earl. It seems to me that a great deal of time has been lost. Apparently the Bill was not introduced into the other House until nearly three weeks after the time when it ought to have been read a second time in your Lordships' House, and it does not seem to me that in these circumstances we should suspend our Sessional Order at
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0372"/>
<col>735</col>
this late period of the session. The House resolved that no Provisional Order Confirmation Bill brought from the House of Commons should be read a second time after July 4. and yet on December 11 it is proposed to read this Bill a second time. If you are going to allow such a long interval to elapse, I do not see the use of retaining the Sessional Order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02512"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I am glad the noble Earl in charge of the Bill and the noble Lord opposite have drawn attention to this matter, because it does at first sight look a little unusual that your Lordships should be asked to suspend the Sessional Order in the case of a Bill which was only introduced into the other House after the date at which, by our Sessional Order, it should have been read a second time here. But the ease is a little exceptional, and I think your Lordships would do well to suspend the Sessional Order in this case and allow the Bill to go forward in the ordinary course, and, if your Lordships pass it, receive the Royal Assent at the end of this session. The fact is that the Order was lodged at the end of January, as is usual. The local inquiry commenced at the end of March, which, as a matter of fact, was only a fortnight after the usual time, and I understand that it was owing largely to geographical difficulties that delays took place which resulted in the Order being introduced at so late a period in the other House. But what really has delayed this Order more than anything else is this. There were two Orders originally in this Confirmation Bill. The other Order was opposed, and the opposition to that Order, which has been dropped, resulted in this Order, which is unopposed, being delayed. If this Order had been in the Bill by itself the Bill would probably have reached your Lordships before we adjourned in August, when no question would have been raised as to the propriety of suspending the Sessional Order. These being the facts, I think your Lordships would do well to agree to this Motion now, having entered a <i>caveat</i> that it is not self-evident that a Sessional Order made in July should necessarily be suspended five months afterwards on a Bill which only reaches your Lordships in December.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02514" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02515">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02516"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that I should be either assisting your Lordships or consulting your convenience were I to begin with a disquisition on the value of national insurance. The subject has been before the mind of the country for many months past, and I think a considerable distinction is drawn between the general principle and the form in which it may be embodied. The great majority for this Bill on its Third Reading in the other House last week shows that, so far as the general principle is concerned&#x2014;and I allude to no more than the general principle&#x2014;the mind of the country is fairly well set upon it, and therefore I propose to go straight to what is the real question before the House to-day, and that is, whether my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has well and truly laid the foundation on which a system can be reared.<lb/>
Before I go to the discharge of a duty which I hope to compress within a reasonable time, there is one thing I should like to say. I regret as much as any of your Lordships can the fact that this Bill comes up for consideration at so late a period of the session, for in this House there are many who, from their knowledge of local government and from other fields of experience, would have been well able to contribute to a minute scrutiny of the provisions of the Bill. But the measure comes before us at a period when that is not possible and the only alternatives are o to put it off for a prolonged period, or else to deal with it without the opportunity for that discussion which a subject so important merits. It might be well, it might be the ideal course, to postpone for a prolonged period&#x2014;and it would need to be a prolonged period&#x2014;the examination of this measure: but there is a well-known French proverb which says that the best is the enemy of the good, a proverb which I think applies here. Suppose we were to delay the passing into law of this Bill, what then? The position of the friendly societies in particular would be deplorable. The very fact that the public has given practical consideration to the new system, and that Parliament is a fair way on in
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0373"/>
<col>737</col>
passing it through, has led to a great transformation already in the situation of these societies. Their members are falling off in number because new entrants are not coming in. As always happens, people are waiting to see what fresh system is going to come into operation, and they are suspending their natural habit of joining these societies in large numbers. Therefore in the interest, not only of the friendly societies, but of all the great business bodies which have to deal with this matter, it would be truly an unfortunate result if the period of suspension were prolonged.<lb/>
But there is another consideration which I own weighs with me very much. This Bill can only, to use an expression which I have already used, lay the foundation. The example of Germany is highly instructive on this point. The great system which came into existence more than a generation since, under the auspices of Prince Bismarck, had been considered with all the capacity of that highly scientific nation, never given to launching a scheme without having in the most careful fashion thought it out beforehand. And what has the experience of Germany shown? The great majority of the people of Germany thoroughly approve of the system, and say it has proved to be a great blessing; but the history of the question shows that almost from the first the experience of the new system disclosed the necessity for the transformation of the original ideas, with the result that in Germany, within the limits that were originally laid down, and as experience has progressed, modification after modification has been made in the system; and even to-day great modifications in the German system appear to be impending. Therefore I say of this Bill that it can be no more than the providing of the ground on which a system is to be reared, with regard to which it is necessary to proceed experimentally, and as to which it is impossible to say that any particular scheme is best without the guiding assistance of experience. All that can be done is to determine the limits within which you will proceed, to ascertain in as careful a manner as possible the various factors of financial safety, and, having done that, to proceed tentatively, with the certainty that in a few years as experience goes on you will have to remould your system in many points, and that it is only experience which can guide you to the final form which it must ultimately assume.<lb/>
<col>738</col>
The task of the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been a very difficult one. He had to deal with an entirely new conception as to which there was very little experience to guide him, and however much my right hon. friend may have excited criticism as to details, I think nobody can doubt that he has thrown into this matter an energy and devotion and a command of his material which are remarkable in the case even of a Minister introducing a very great reform. And what your Lordships, I take it, have as the real question before you to-day is not this and that detail, but whether the framework which he has fashioned, financial and administrative, as well as legislative, is a sound framework, and one within which and upon which you may build up the edifice which we are aspiring to construct. With these remarks I pass to what are the purposes and principles of the Bill. If I wanted to define its object in a sentence, I would say that that object was to introduce among the majority of the working classes the habits of providence which distinguish a large minority, but still a minority, at the present time. There will always be an aristocracy of labour who will be content with nothing short of things that go far beyond the benefits which even this Bill will confer. Those who know the working classes are aware of the extraordinary extent to which they effect insurances, not merely in friendly societies and trade unions, but with the great industrial companies and the insurance societies of the country. It is a system which I am glad to say is progressing with the progress of the working classes; but apart from those who make special provision there is a large number who insure something like the benefits of this Bill. At present about 6,000,000 of those who work with their hands provide against sickness. We hope by the machinery of this Bill to raise that number to something approaching 15,000,000&#x2014;to cover practically the whole field of those who work with their hands.<lb/>
The Bill deals with the two subjects of sickness and breakdown, and in a minor but still a very important degree with unemployment. I shall say more about sickness and breakdown to-day than about the other subject, because, following the course which was taken in the other House of Parliament, my noble friend Lord Beauchamp will take charge of the unemployment section of this Bill, and therefore it is only very generally that I shall deal with the provisions relating to unemployment. The system that the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0374"/>
<col>739</col>
Bill proposes to introduce is, even as regards health, a limited one. We do not touch death for the good reason that the field of insurance against death is well covered. There is an extraordinary number of policies against death current among the working classes, quite enough to make it unnecessary and inexpedient to touch that side of the case, because I must remind your Lordships that the purpose of this Bill is not to supersede the friendly societies, not to do work which they are already doing, but greatly to expand their work and to introduce their operations into ground which they do not at present cover. Therefore we do not touch death. But there is another object which the Bill aims at effecting indirectly, and that is the object of preventing disease instead of merely providing for it. At the present time it is admitted that something like 30 per cent, of the pauperism in this country is due to sickness. Consumption alone effects tremendous ravages among our population. Some 300,000 people every year are always ill with consumption in these islands, and about 60,000 die from it every year, with an average previous life of not more than live years since the disease began to make itself manifest. Therefore we have there a tremendous problem in prevention, and I hope to show your Lordships that the Bill does a great deal, not merely to provide for sickness when sickness has once set in, but to prevent sickness arising at all. And the machinery we set up will introduce better inspection, greater care, and motives of prudence which do not at present exist, and if that were the only result which the Bill would effect it would be well justified.<lb/>
I now come to the machinery of the Bill. The first question I have to answer is, What are the principles on which the machinery rests? The first principle is one which I need not discuss at length&#x2014;it is the principle that to make a system of this kind effective it must be compulsory. All experience shows that, and this proposition has been so generally accepted after a great deal of discussion that I do not propose to trouble your Lordships by going into details on that point. The next principle is that the system should be contributory. That is a phase of this scheme to which, speaking for myself, I attach very great importance. I believe that every system of insurance, whether against old age, against sickness, or against death, is far better if placed, so far as you can place it, upon a
<col>740</col>
contributory basis. I may be asked, Why, then, did you not put old-age pensions on a contributory basis? My answer to that is a very simple one. The class we were seeking to provide for under the old-age pension system was a class which in the main had had no opportunity of providing for itself, a class which was upon the very margin, a class of people who had spent their substance during their working lives on their families and dependants, and who came to old age without a chance of making any provision. But this Bill does introduce the contributory principle even as regards old-age pensions. When I come to explain the system of additional and extension benefits which the Bill contemplates, your Lordships will find that among those are an increase to the existing old-age pensions and an acceleration of them, both dependent upon a contributory basis; and I think it is all to the good that the contributory system should be so extended that it can touch even this class of benefits.<lb/>
The third great principle of the Bill is to use not the machinery of the State, but that of the friendly societies. The friendly societies have this enormous advantage, that if you work through them you have a state of things in which every member is interested in getting the utmost for his money, in keeping down false cases, in excluding cases of malingering, in encouraging habits of carefulness and prudence such as obviate sickness, and it is the <i>esprit de corps</i> of the friendly societies and their watchfulness in this direction that is your greatest safeguard against malingering. We were led to that consideration by the experience of Germany. The splendid system of Germany has had the one defect that the tendency is for the rate of sickness, of apparent sickness I should say to rise, and for malingering to make itself manifest. That comes, we think, in a considerable degree from the fact that the responsibility for looking after these things is in Germany mainly centralised and with the State. In Germany there are local funds, but they are under close supervision and highly centralised State management. The result is that there is not the same direct motive as with the friendly societies to deal with cases of malingering, or to take those steps and give that counsel which tend to reduce the rate of sickness. In Germany, too, the system has got into the hands of the State in a complicated form that we do not desire to see here. For instance, disablement is
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0375"/>
<col>741</col>
under a separate authority from sickness, and old-ape pensions are mixed up with disablement and sickness. In Germany there are thirty-one pension offices and ten-trades institutions, and there are varying rates of contributions and varying rates of benefit.<lb/>
The result of the consideration of this most valuable German experience&#x2014;and I think the world owes a great deal to Germany for the lesson it has taught in being the first to fashion out a system of national insurance&#x2014;is that we do well, if we can, to give the people themselves a direct motive to look after each other and to guard against imposition, and on the other hand, to get the most for their money. What I have stated to your Lordships is a root principle of the Bill. Our intention is that the Insurance Commissioners should not look upon themselves as there in any way to supersede the friendly societies, but rather 1o encourage them in every way to develop their own business. We wish the friendly societies not only to take on the vastly increased business which we are asking them to assume, but also to conduct their own business with extra benefits outside what this Bill contemplates in their own fashion. The last thing we desire is any way to say, as some have said, that the day of the friendly societies is over. On the contrary, I hope that friendly societies are opening a new and still more important chapter of their history&#x2014;a chapter in which their functions will be greater and more important than has been the case hitherto. Everybody who has had to do with these societies knows the spirit of mutual watchfulness which the members exercise over each other. If a man has a tendency to drink, which affects the increase of his sickness allowance, he is at once called to book, and I am told that the friendly societies exercise great pressure in the interests of temperance. Then take the case of a servant who is suffering from an&#x00E6;mia, a disease which is said to result from a too confined indoor life. The friendly societies watch over those cases, suggest a change of situation, and do an amount of detail work of that kind which is of vital importance if you are to keep down the rate of sickness. Those are the three great principles of the Bill. Now I come to the machinery by which they are to be made effective.<lb/>
<col>742</col>
At the root of this Bill and at the root of every scheme of this kind lies finance. Unless the financial system on which the Bill is based is sound the scheme must fail, and really if I were to select what seems to me to be the most vital point in this Bill I should say it is the financial system which it embodies. That financial system is one which has received the closest attention for a good while past from the best experts whom the Chancellor of the Exchequer could collect. Not only have some of the most distinguished actuaries in this country, actuaries specially connected with the work of friendly societies, been engaged upon it, but the experts at the Treasury have been giving prolonged attention to the subject, with the result that a scheme has emerged which I hope when your Lordships hear what it is&#x2014;and you know a good deal of it already&#x2014;you will think represents at all events the most prudent course that could have been adopted, and one which lays down limits beyond which the financial results of the scheme cannot stray. If the financial system is sound, we have got our factor of financial safety. We have got limits outside which the scheme cannot naturally expand. I will ask your Lord ships' indulgence while I say a few words about this root consideration.<lb/>
Three courses were open to the Government in face of the difficulty which confronted them. They wanted to bring everybody compulsorily into insurance, but then some of these people were old and some were young. If you brought them all in compulsorily, you would have had to bring them all in at the same rate of contribution, or you would have had to find money in the shape of doles to equalise the contributions. To something like that we have ultimately come, but in a very different form. That would have been a most clumsy and complicated alternative. The only other alternative to the one which was ultimately adopted was this, to equalise the position of old and young members under the, insurance system by making a large grant in respect of each person. As a matter of fact, the sum would have been &#x00A3;63,000,000 sterling to put every life on the same footing. That did not seem a justifiable way of going to work. The third course is the one we have adopted, arid it is this. Every person who comes into compulsory insurance and is over the minimum age will have what is called a reserve credited
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0376"/>
<col>743</col>
to him. Take the position of a man of 40. Sickness begins to become more frequent as you get on in life. Therefore to insure against it you have to pay more if you start your insurance at that time. But if you have been in insurance from the age of 16, the minimum age, then your contributions have rolled up over a period in which there is less sickness, and they provide you with a reserve which enables you to say at 40, "I have contributed all these years since the age of 16, therefore my contributions are adequate to enable me to reap the fruits of the ordinary benefits, notwithstanding that with me sickness is likely to be more than in my earlier days." What we had to do was to put the man of 40 in as good a position as the man at 16. The man of 16 is making a fixed contribution, the man of 40 is making exactly the same contribution, but we had to provide the man of 40 with the same reserve as he would have had to his credit if he had been in insurance since the age of 16. The way in which that is done is that the State gives, through the Insurance Commissioners, to each man insured a credit appropriate to his age. In the case of the man of 40 it is larger than in the case of the man at 30, and so on. The man of 16, of course, requires no credit because he has come in at the initial age.<lb/>
Now, how is the money for that to be provided. It is a credit in each case from the State on which the friendly society can draw. It can treat the man as having at his credit the amount of that reserve and draw for his benefits. It is done in this way. We have divided the benefits into three classes. The first class are what are called the minimum benefits. If your Lordships look at Clause 8 of the Bill you will find the three classes of benefits mentioned. The first is the minimum benefits, such as 10<i>s.</i> a week during sickness, 5<i>s.</i> during disablement, medical benefits, and so on. Those are the minimum benefits which everybody, with one exception, is to have. The second class of benefits referred to in Clause 8 and also referred to in the Schedule which deals with benefits is what are called the additional benefits. These are benefits which may assume various forms&#x2014;additional to old-age pension, anticipation to old-age pension, dental treatment (a most important matter with the working classes), increased sickness allowance, and various things which belong to a higher category of benefits. Then there is the third class
<col>744</col>
of benefits which are called extension benefits. They are foreshadowed and referred to in Clause 8, but Parliament has hereafter to determine the form which these are to assume.<lb/>
The minimum benefits come into operation at once. Every one is entitled in principle to his benefits from the date at which he comes into insurance, so long as these are minimum benefits and he pays the standard contribution to get them. But the contribution which the insured person pays is loaded with a margin of about 6 per cent., and that 6 per cent, will make the friendly societies who manage their business prudently carry on their business at a profit, and that profit will go to provide the second class of benefits&#x2014;the additional benefits. After three years the insurance society is to have its assets valued. If there turns out to be an increase in those assets, the profit on the carrying on of its State Insurance business&#x2014;and this fund is carefully segregated&#x2014;is to go for the purpose of adding additional benefits to the minimum benefits. That may happen as early as three years after the passing of the Bill and possibly in some cases even a little earlier, and it is a process which will go on. In the case of well-managed societies these additional benefits will be there, and in the case of societies that are not well managed their members will be annoyed because they will find that their society has not been conducting its affairs in such a fashion as to secure for them the additional benefits.<lb/>
Then there are the extension benefits which are left to be defined by Parliament hereafter. The reason for that is that we want more experience to show what is the best form which these benefits should assume when they come into operation, and they cannot come into operation, for a reason which is fundamental, before a little over eighteen years from the inception of the system. I explained that the reserves credited to the older insurers have to be wiped out, and they are wiped out in this way. The sevenpence which is the amount of contribution that an employed man and his employer pay is sufficient, not only to secure the minimum benefits, but also to provide a margin for the additional benefits which is rolled up by the friendly society. The State comes in at this stage. Under Clause 3 of the Bill the provision of the cost of benefits is to be made, two-ninths by the State, and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0377"/>
<col>745</col>
seven-ninths by the employer and employed. Taking a benefit which is contributed to by the employer and the employed to the extent one of threepence and the other of fourpence&#x2014;that is to say, sevenpence in all&#x2014;the State will contribute two-ninths of the cost of the benefit which that premium purchases. Now how does that work out? The benefit is calculated as worth sevenpence. The employer and employed provide that sevenpence; but then two-ninths of the cost of the benefit is taken off by the intervention of the State, which is bound under the Bill to pay two-ninths of the cost of the benefit. Now the benefit is worth sevenpence, and if your Lordships will do a little sum you will find that two-ninths of sevenpence represents a penny and five-ninths. That penny and five-ninths is not wanted for the purchase of the benefit. The contribution of the employer and employed goes entirely in this purchase of the sevenpenny benefit and additional benefits, but the one penny and five-ninths which is released from their contribution by the contribution of the State goes through the hands of the Insurance Commissioners to extinguish these credits. It rolls up to a large sum every year, and the actuarial calculation shows that, at the end of a little over eighteen years, the whole of the credits which are given for the older lives will be wiped out by the operation of that penny and five-ninths. It is a fair enough transaction, because the man gets sevenpence worth of benefits for sevenpence. What he does not get is the equivalent of the State contribution. The equivalent of the State contribution to the extent of a penny and five-ninths goes to extinguish these credits, so that the result will be that after eighteen years there will be a large increase in the amount of money set free. The whole of the State contribution will be coming in to provide these extension benefits under Clause 3 in the shape in which Parliament shall by that time decide to fashion them. There may be a considerable addition to old-age pensions, there may be old-age pensions at 65, there may be increased sick allowance, there may be very much extended medical treatment, and there are a vast variety of ways in which these things may be dealt with. It is for Parliament to say. But the point is this, that from to-day the money is rolled up which will eighteen years after this provide those extension benefits of which I have spoken.<lb/>
<col>746</col>
I do not feel any confidence that I have succeeded in making myself clear on this question of finance. It is very complicated. I think I understand it myself, and I trust that your Lordships will have understood something of it from what I have said. There has been a huge controversy as to whether the State was contributing twopence or whether it was not. Some said it was not, and that it was all a fraud; others said it was, and that it was a great boon. The truth is that what the State is paying is what will work out on the average, over a tract of years, to at least a contribution of twopence. The State pays two-ninths, and as the benefits increase the State has to pay more and more, so that when we get to the extension benefits period the State will be paying more than twopence, but in the earlier stages it will not pay so much. Taking the average, the equivalent of twopence is being rolled up for the benefit of all the insurers. The younger insurer when he reaches the age of 34&#x2014;I think I have added 18 to 16 correctly&#x2014;will get these much larger benefits which have been provided by the effect of this process of wiping out. He will get the full benefit of the State contribution. That is the financial scheme of the Bill. It has been worked out by the actuaries with the utmost caution, and I think myself, as far as I can judge, that they have been very conservative in their margins. There are some parts of the Bill where really the actuarial <i>data</i> are very scanty and about which you cannot be sure. For instance, take the case of a married woman. The periods of sickness with a married woman are so uncertain that there is nothing very reliable that can be gone on. We at first thought it would be wiser to keep married women out of the Bill altogether, but that could not be done and accordingly we have taken them in on as conservative a margin as possible. But for the rest we have had valuable <i>data</i> to go upon. There is the experience of the friendly societies, and the actuaries have loaded the premiums with a considerable margin to cover contingencies, and I am informed by those most competent to judge that, on the general part of the scheme, the calculations of the actuaries are not only apparently very reliable, but are based on a very conservative footing. And in addition to that, in every case a margin has been added to cover unforeseen contingencies. Therefore I venture to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0378"/>
<col>747</col>
hope that experience will show that the basis upon which these calculations have been made is sound. Again I say that beyond ascertaining certain general facts, such as I have referred to, it is impossible to have any certainty in a matter of this sort. We are making a great new departure, justified by what I believe will be the incalculable benefits which the introduction of these habits of insurance and prudence, and the consequent prevention of disease, will bring to the great mass of our population. To do this you must risk something. All that we can do in a matter so novel, and in which experience affords so little guide, is to use the best material we can and come to the most careful conclusions that are possible.<lb/>
So much for finance. Now I come to the way in which this is worked out. First, I will take the machinery of the Bill with respect to sickness and breakdown, and I will go at once to the question of the persons who come under the obligation to insure against these evils. To begin with, all persons employed under a contract of service must be insured compulsorily. There are exceptions to that, such as where the work is not manual and the remuneration exceeds &#x00A3;160 a year. The clerk, for instance, who gets over &#x00A3;160 is under no obligation to insure. Then there is a second class which will contribute a considerable number of people to the benefits of this scheme and which will be equally assisted by the State, and that is the class of voluntary insurers, the class of persons who are not employed within the definition I have given and whose incomes are less than &#x00A3;160. Another class is those who have been employed contributors for five years. They are then entitled to go into the class of voluntary insurers and escape further compulsion if they please. These are the two classes&#x2014;the compulsory insurers and the voluntary insurers. As to age limits, nobody comes under the obligation at a lower age than 16 or after 65.<lb/>
Now I pass to the benefits. I have already told your Lordships of the three classes of benefits, the third of which is left for future definition. But the benefits generally your Lordships will find described in Clauses 8 to 13 of the Bill. The benefits so far as they are minimum or ordinary benefits consist of items such as the following&#x2014;sickness, in the case of a man 10<i>s.,</i> and
<col>748</col>
in the case of a woman 7<i>s.</i>6<i>d</i>. a week, for 26 weeks. A point has arisen here as to which there has been a good deal of controversy. If you allow' people to get sickness allowance for the first three days, experience has shown that that is a potent cause of malingering, and in those cases generally they are able to look after themselves for so long, or they are looked after. We have thought it best to bring them into the, insurance benefit on the fourth day. Exception has been taken to that by some of the friendly societies on this ground, that their own practice has been to bring their members into insurance earlier. One quite respects and appreciates the desire to maintain a tradition, but we have been unable to satisfy ourselves that it is a good tradition. Remember you are using State funds here, and malingering becomes a thing you have to guard against more closely than under the restricted voluntary system of friendly societies. Therefore we do not think we should be justified in recommending that the first three clays of sickness should be brought in, and in that we are following certain precedents in the Workmen's Compensation Act. We thought it right to compensate, and we have more than compensated, for the exclusion of these three days, by extending the sickness benefit for 26 weeks instead of 13 weeks, with a diminished benefit towards the end. Therefore although we know we have not quite satisfied all the friendly societies on this point, we think we have come to the right decision, more particularly as it is absolutely vital in a matter of this kind, where State resources are engaged, to ascertain clearly the limits of your liability and take care that the taxpayers' money is not wasted.<lb/>
Then there is disablement or breakdown benefit of 5<i>s.</i> a week. If a person is permanently incapacitated or temporarily incapacitated after a period of illness as a result of some specific disease, then he gets disablement allowance. Then there are medical treatment and medicines, with the proper appliances; sanatoria benefits for cases of tuberculosis; and maternity benefit of 30<i>s.</i> for the wife of an insured person. Of course, if a married woman insures, as she can do, she does not get two maternity benefits, but she gets the same thing, because she gets the 30s., her husband's benefit if she is the wife of an insured person, and also 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0379"/>
<col>749</col>
week for four weeks' sickness allowance, which amounts to the same thing. Then I come to the additional benefits, which may begin to come into operation very quickly. First, there is medical treatment for the children and dependents of the insured person. That I think is very valuable. Then there is dental treatment, and those of your Lordships who have, had experience of the suffering of servants from the want of dentistry will appreciate what a valuable right this may become. Then there are increased sickness and disablement benefits, an increase of maternity benefit, extra allowance during convalescence, earlier and larger old-age pensions, and other, benefits to which I need not refer. Those are the additional benefits, and the extensions in Clause 8 are left to be defined by Parliament when the question becomes practical in the light of the experience then gained. An additional benefit, as I have explained, comes from the margin of 6 per cent, with which the insurance premiums are loaded, and although the employed and the employer between them contribute seven-pence and sevenpence worth is given, still the benefits do not cost quite seven-pence. The State contribution not only lowers them, but there is yet another margin included and that rolls up to provide the additional benefits. The result is that in well-managed societies there may be a surplus after the first valuation which will provide the first instalment of the addition to the benefits.<lb/>
The principle of the Bill is what in insurance slang is called a "flat rate." In Germany the people contribute different sums in proportion to their wages. A man with large wages contributes more in the way of premium and gets larger benefit, and a person with small wages contributes little and gets very little benefit; but there is under our system the same contribution and the same benefit for everybody, and the result of this system ought to be, if these calculations work out, that at the end of eighteen years nearly &#x00A3;7,000,000 will be available for the provision of the extension benefits of which I have spoken. Of course it is said, and with great truth, that this system imposes an additional burden upon employers of threepence a week in respect of each person insured. That is quite true, and one is always loth to add anything to the burden on industry. But the experience of Germany is very
<col>750</col>
instructive on this point. The testimony of the employers of labour in Germany is almost unanimous that the system has been of benefit even to themselves. In the first place, it has brought about a better distribution of charity, and they do not have to provide sick allowances and benefits individually. In the second place, it has tended to greater efficiency on the part of the workmen; and, in the third place, it has been worked into the cost of production. Our employers have a rather lighter burden to bear than the German employer with whose products they compete, and my hope is that this burden, which after all is small in proportion to the enormous results it brings about, will prove to have relieved the best class of employers of a good deal of the responsibility for charity that comes upon them at the present time, and to have produced assistance from which not only the employers but the State will have got good value for their expenditure, if only in the direction of relief from anxiety and burden by having a contented and pro-vided-for population who have not constantly to make applications for assistance.<lb/>
Now I pass to the contributions. These your Lordships will find in Clauses 4 to 9 of the Bill, and in the Second Schedule. The contributions consist of a total made up in this way&#x2014;two-ninths are borne by the State in the case of men, and one-fourth by the State in the case of women, and seven-ninths in the case of men and three-fourths in the case of women by the employers and employed. Then in the Schedule it is laid down what the contributions are to be. The employer pays threepence; the employed, if he is a man, pays fourpence, and if a woman threepence. Where the remuneration is under a certain rate, where cheap labour is employed and board and lodging is not given, the employer's contribution is larger and the proportion paid by the employed goes down. Where under 9<i>s.</i> a week is paid the employed pays nothing; but in these cases, and up to 12<i>s.</i> a week of wages, the State contributes one penny. That is quite a different grant from those to which I have referred. The contributions are what I have stated, and, as I said, taking the average for the period of years the State contribution will be twopence&#x2014;at one period it is rather less and at another period it is rather more, but it averages a payment of twopence.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0380"/>
<col>751</col>
I have spoken throughout as though the friendly societies were the only machinery for the Bill. That unfortunately cannot be the case. We leave the friendly societies at present perfectly free to choose their lives; we do not interfere with them; we invite them to choose their lives because we wish to keep up their <i>esprit de corps</i> and that watchfulness which has been the policy of the friendly societies up to now. But there are the cases that the friendly societies will not take into insurance. For example, there is the case of the man of fifty years of age who wishes to come into insurance. The friendly societies will not take him because, even with his reserve, it is a life likely to have an undue proportion of sickness. Consequently we have had to make provision for these lives who cannot get insurance from voluntary agencies. We have to give this man an option, and the option we give him is the deposit insurance system through the medium of the Post Office. Those who come in there receive State contributions to their benefits in the same way as the others, and are dealt with under the same contributions and obligations, but there is this difference&#x2014;they receive only what they have paid in and the State contribution in addition; they do not receive benefits at the expense of the other members. Each deposit insurer is treated on his own account, and, unlike the case of the friendly societies, he cannot call in his neighbours to contribute if the burden on his premium becomes heavier than in the ordinary circumstances would be the case.<lb/>
Deposit insurance is obviously not so good as the insurance through the friendly societies. We know that, and, what is more, we do not contemplate that it should continue in its present form. It was necessary to provide for deposit insurance at the outset because of the older lives, but as people come in at the age of sixteen they will be much more freely taken by the friendly societies than when they come in at forty. A friendly society does not concern itself so much, in the case of anybody coming in at the age of sixteen years, as to whether it is a life that is likely to be sound or not. In the ease of insurance against death you take great account of the character of the life. Anybody with a tendency to heart disease, for instance, is rejected; but in the case of a friendly society insuring against sickness as distinguished from death, the person with heart disease is a
<col>752</col>
gold mine; he is very valuable, because if his life is short you have had his premiums. He is presumably a normal life as regards sickness in the meantime, and you get his premiums and do not have the burden of his old age coming upon you. Therefore we know from experience that those coming in at the age of sixteen are likely to be in the freest way taken by the friendly societies, and when everybody has come in at the age of sixteen there will be comparatively few coming in at the age of forty or fifty. So we have provided in the Bill that this deposit insurance system through the Post Office is to continue in its present form only until 1915. By that time we shall be in a position to remould this part of the scheme. Experience will have taught us what number of lives we are likely to have to deal with, and we may be able to deal with them in a somewhat different fashion, with more paternal care exercised, or we may continue the system with some modifications. At any rate, of this we are certain, that deposit insurance contributors will become year by year a diminishing class, and before long this class will become so restricted that we shall have to deal with them in some other way. A deposit insurer has this advantage, that if he dies with money to his credit, he can leave four-sevenths of it behind&#x2014;money representing, roughly, his own contributions as distinguished from those of his employer and the State.<lb/>
I pass from the consideration of deposit insurance to the next piece of machinery as to which I wish to say something&#x2014;the friendly societies themselves; with regard to whom I have already stated to your Lordships that it is our desire to effect an improvement in their condition. To begin with, they will be enormously strengthened financially by the addition of these contributions. The State contribution in itself will be of great value to them, and they will be the main instrument and in the course of time practically the exclusive instrument in working out the policy of this scheme. That means there will be an amount of pressure against malingering, an amount of mutual observance among the members with a view to economy which we could not possibly have got under any system which did not rest upon decentralisation, but upon direct supervision by officials. The object is to eliminate officials as far as we can, and to rely on the co-operation of the members themselves.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0381"/>
<col>753</col>
A contributory system with societies like this is a valuable thing if it works out as a successful institution. I believe it will be found far better and far more acceptable than a non-contributory system based on Socialistic principles, of which one hears a good deal of talk just now, but which I believe we shall find much less talked about when there is a compulsory system at work in conjunction with the friendly societies developed and strengthened in a fashion we do not appreciate at this time. Friendly societies will administer sickness, disablement, and maternity benefits. Certain benefits will be left to the local health committees, which I will deal with in a few moments, and in particular the medical and sanatoria benefits will be administered through the local health committees for reasons connected with the medical profession and other reasons on which I will touch later. But the main instrument will be the friendly societies.<lb/>
I have used the words "friendly societies." I want now to make a correction of that. Friendly societies will mean in the future the friendly societies of to-day and also something else. "Approved societies" is the right term, and it is the term used in the Bill. The approved societies will be societies of the type of the friendly society, but they may include sections of societies or corporations which exist for quite different purposes than those of a friendly society. The approved societies will not only include workmen's provident associations organised by employers, they will not only include trades unions, but they will also include sections founded for the purpose by great insurance companies, such as the Prudential, which will be able to start branches for the working of this huge system. One condition which we impose in the case of all, friendly or private society, or whatever it may be, is that they observe certain conditions. The first is that in the working of the section which handles the Government business they make no profit; the second is that the affairs of the section or the society, as the case may be, are to be under the control of their members. Those are the two great conditions, and any society which conforms to those conditions may be approved either as a whole or in the form of a separate section conforming to the conditions. We have made provisions which enable existing insurance societies and societies of other kinds to take up powers in their charter or memorandum of
<col>754</col>
association. When a society has been approved it will come into the line of conduct which the Bill prescribes. It will be inspected and investigated with a view to discover, among other things, whether it has a deficit or a surplus. If it has a deficit it can be made good out of surplus in the hands of the central body of the society or by way of compulsory levies, as is done under the Friendly Societies Acts at the present time. It will receive a certain amount of money to handle. Under the general scheme of the Bill the money is collected by the Post Office in the form of stamps; the Post Office pays over to the Insurance Commissioners the contributions, and the Insurance Commissioners invest them and hold them and liquidate the credits which the individual members hold. They will hold a certain amount of funds for the members of the societies&#x2014;that is to say, at the credit of the societies themselves. Consequently it will be open to the Insurance Commissioners to hand over to the societies that part of the fund for investment, and we have provided that if the societies desire it they have the option of either leaving the investments as to a certain proportion&#x2014;the proportion which comes from members' contributions&#x2014;in the hands of the Insurance Commissioners to remain invested by them, or to take them over and invest them to that limited extent, repaying the contributions of their own members themselves. But if they do that they must invest in trustee securities. The accounts of the societies I need not say must be kept in a separate form as regards this class of business, and the societies must give security and conform to the conditions. Small societies may federate, a provision which we think will enable a large number of small societies under 10,000 members to come into the working of the scheme.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the public authorities which are to superintend the administration of the measure. As I said, the policy is to interfere as little as possible and only so far as is necessary to guarantee security. To begin with, there are the Insurance Commissioners. As the Bill first stood, there was only one body of Insurance Commissioners&#x2014;that for the United Kingdom; but discussion showed that the fact that there were in Ireland, for example, different rates of wages and different prices would necessitate an adjustment in the contribution. If your Lordships look at
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0382"/>
<col>755</col>
the Schedule you will find that the contributions and benefits in the case of Ireland are different from the contributions and benefits in the rest of the United Kingdom. Moreover, in Ireland there is established under Irish local government a local dispensary system under which medical benefits are already provided for. Ireland wanted a new scheme, and the work of the Commissioners would have involved a great deal of inspection and study on the spot. It was therefore thought better to set up separate bodies of Commissioners, because what was true in the case of Ireland was true also, although in a rather less degree of Scotland, where the conditions are different from those in England. The customs in regard to agricultural labourers, for example, and other features of national life are not the same. The result is that there are now four sets of Commissioners, one for England, one for Scotland, one for Ireland, and one for Wales. Provision is made for these Commissioners to meet and manage their affairs to a certain extent in common. Under Clause 83 of the Bill&#x2014;an important clause which ought not to be overlooked in the study of this subject&#x2014;there is a joint committee of the four bodies of Insurance Commissioners, and that joint committee, under a President, will discuss and ascertain matters of policy which are fundamental and common to the whole system. The Insurance Commissioners can only, of course, exercise a general control and look after finance. When you come to local questions, such as the conditions of health in a particular district, you want a less centralised system, and that we have provided in the local health committees.<lb/>
I should explain that if the Bill is read a second time in your Lordships' House to-day I shall move that it be committed <i>pro forma</i> in order to be reprinted with the term "insurance committee" substituted for "health committee." as some of the local authorities are taking exception to the term local health committee as likely to lead to confusion, it being at present in existence. As there are on this point some 90 verbal Amendments it will be necessary for your Lordships to have the Bill reprinted with this correction. Each of these committees will consist of from 40 to 80 members, appointed under regulations made by the Insurance Commissioners in such a way as to secure the representation of insured persons to the extent of three-fifths of the
<col>756</col>
members of the local committee; there will be one-fifth by the county council or the county borough council, two members appointed by the medical practitioners in the county, and so on. In that way we hope to get a committee that will settle the multitude of questions which will arise and which will vary from locality to locality, questions with which the Insurance Commissioners could not themselves adequately deal. The functions of the local insurance committees will be to report on health. That is the great thing. They will furnish statistics not only about abnormal but about normal conditions, such as we do not possess at the present time, and this ought to be of great value in combating disease. They will conduct special inquiries. If the rate of sickness turns out to be abnormally high they will set on foot an inquiry which will usually be under the auspices of the Local Government Board, and they may bring either local authorities or private persons to account for insanitary conditions, polluted water supplies, and so forth, which have led to excessive sickness and so thrown an excessive charge on the insurance fund. Such are the main functions of the authorities which will administer this Bill. These local committees will also manage the admission to the sanatoria which are to be erected in the main under the auspices of the Local Government Board. The Government propose to start these sanatoria by contributing &#x00A3;1,500,000 for their erection, and there will be an expenditure of about &#x00A3;1,000,000 in addition on their upkeep every year. Then they must make the medical arrangements for the deposit insurers with whom the societies do not deal, provide instruction as to the preservation of health, and undertake the delicate and difficult business of negotiating with the doctors. I shall come to the doctors in a minute or two. Such are the functions of the authorities which will administer this Bill.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, a few words about one or two of the classes which come in. Married women are a great difficulty. We have had to deal with them on a special footing, because you cannot let married women in like ordinary persons. Their ailments are such as to be beyond the knowledge, much less the control, of the ordinary or of any other friendly society. Consequently we have made special provision for them. Clause 43 deals with married women, and provides in substance
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0383"/>
<col>757</col>
this. If a woman who has been insured before marriage marries she gets ordinarily no benefit while her husband lives if she is unemployed, but one third of her transfer value&#x2014;that is, the value at which she stands in her society&#x2014;with the reserve credited to her will be carried to a special account, and two-thirds of it will be earmarked for her. The object of ear-marking one-third of that is that if her husband dies and she becomes a widow she may get back into insurance as if she had never been out of it, and although she may, perhaps, be an oldish woman by that time she will not have to pay increased premiums. If she becomes employed after her husband's death no arrears will be counted during the marriage, and the transfer of this account will give her her proper reserve value, and she will go on as if she had never been out of insurance. The married woman, if employed during marriage, can go on being insured with the old benefits; we have taken that risk. If she is not employed, she may become a voluntary contributor at special rates and on special terms, and if she does not wish to contribute as a voluntary contributor we have allowed her reserve value to take effect on a basis which takes special cognisance of those illnesses which affect married women. Her remaining two-thirds will be applied so as to give her 5<i>s</i>. a week during confinement&#x2014;an extra payment&#x2014;and special payments during sickness and distress. So your Lordships will see that married women come off pretty well. If a woman marries and ceases to work and goes out of insurance and then takes up employment again as a widow, all arrears are blotted out and she comes in as if she had never passed out of insurance. If she continues to go on she can go as an employed contributor; she can go on as a voluntary contributor, with benefits at a moderate rate; or she can say, "No, I have two-thirds remaining, and those two-thirds I will take in the form of special benefit&#x2014;payment during confinement, and payment during a period of distress or sickness." So much for married women.<lb/>
I come now to a very thorny point, the point about domestic servants. I think there has been a great deal of misapprehension with regard to this point, and I must say from what I have seen, looking at the case of domestic servants as a whole, that I can conceive no class more likely to benefit by this Bill. My right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a letter
<col>758</col>
which he wrote the other day to some ladies who had doubts on this subject and asked him for information, said this&#x2014;
<quote>"Let me remind you briefly how the proposal affects them. It means that the State undertakes a liability of some &#x00A3;800,000 a year in respect of benefits to domestic servants, and that the employers of servants contribute some &#x00A3;1,200,000 a year for the same purpose. From the money thus made available, together with the servants' own contributions, every servant will be entitled to free medical attendance, to the payment of 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d.</i> a week during sickness for six months, and 5<i>s</i>. thereafter if permanently incapacitated, and free treatment in a sanatorium if she contracts tuberculosis. These are the minimum benefits under the Bill, but if, as has been said, domestic servants do not require the full sickness benefit, the money thus saved can be used with any other savings to give some other benefit, as, for instance, a superannuation fund which would provide pensions at an earlier age than seventy. I may add that servants who marry are given the value of two-: thirds of their insurance in any one of several; ways, the remaining one-third being used to give them the right to immediate benefit should they become widows, so that if they are excluded altogether they will be unable to profit by the specially favourable terms given in the Bill to women who were insured persons before marriage. This would be a great deprivation to them."</quote>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer refers to alternative benefits which servants may have. That is provided for by Clause 13 of the Bill. That clause enables special schemes to be made, with the approval of the Insurance Commissioners, for special classes, including domestic servants. That is the only case in which the minimum benefit is allowed to have substituted for it certain other benefits, among them being an increased old-age pension, various provisions for sickness and old age, assistance of dependents, and other things which ought to be very valuable in the case of servants.<lb/>
The insurance societies and friendly societies will doubtless make many of these alternative schemes and compete for the insurance of domestic servants. When you consider the great benefit in money which domestic servants get in this fashion, surely this is a scheme which really adds very much to their savings and puts them in a position in which they will be very much better off than they are at the present time. We all know that a large class of employers treat their servants with the utmost kindness, and take care of them during sickness. But we also know this curious fact, that when a servant leaves there is a kind of code of honour among them never to ask their employer for assistance after they have left him for a certain time, although they will do so a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0384"/>
<col>759</col>
short time after leaving. They do not like to come back after a time, and many of them do not go back into the same class and are very ill provided for. The figures which we have obtained show that in the Poor-law infirmaries a very large proportion of the sick are domestic servants, girls who have dropped out of employment and who have no one to look after them. Servants are very apt to be careless about their savings, and if the brother or brother-in-law goes into business he thinks it quite legitimate to go to the girl and ask her to lend him her savings for the purpose of his business, and very often the money is lost. The excuse given for borrowing from her is that she has no one depending on her, or that she will marry and it will be all right; but that does not always happen, and there are many cases where a systematic provision such as this Bill makes with all sorts of alternative forms of benefit, every one of them on the soundest financial basis and State aided, would be of the greatest value to servants. No doubt there has been a great deal of trouble about this clause, but I think as it stands it is in as elastic a fashion as could well be desired. If the employer chooses to make the arrangement, he or she can undertake to give the servant six weeks' maintenance during sickness, and then the employer's contribution is somewhat diminished. There are various ways in which the servant can be helped. She can go into hospital with 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week to assist her while there, or she can draw her 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d.</i> a week while sick in her mistress's home and pay the doctor on her own account. I will say no more about the provisions as to servants.<lb/>
I should like to say a word or two about soldiers and sailors. I will take the case of the soldier, because I know more about him. With the Colours he does not need much insurance; he is looked after in the hospitals of his camp. When he leaves the Colours and goes into the Reserve and enters civil employment he is, perhaps, over 30, and he comes in at a disadvantage as an old life. Therefore we have to bring him into insurance as at 16 in the ordinary way; but there is no necessity for us to charge him as much as we charge the ordinary civilian at 16, because the Army takes care of the soldier during his service. The same <i>mutatis mutandis</i> is true of the Navy. Therefore there is a reduced contribution. The soldier will pay only 1&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> a week during his service, and out of
<col>760</col>
Army funds another 1&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> a week will be paid as the employer's contribution, and the State will pay 1<i>d.</i> The fund thus created will be enough to provide a proper reserve value if, on leaving the Service, he is transferred to a friendly society. If for some reason he cannot get into an insurance society, there is a new insurance fund set up and his contributions will be carried to that.<lb/>
Consumption is, unfortunately, very common among both soldiers and sailors, and there is a new Army and Navy Insurance Fund set up by the Bill which makes the same provision for soldiers and sailors as an approved society would have done. Clause 45 deals with that, and creates a great reform both for the Army and the Navy. The effect of it is that consumptive soldiers and sailors will be looked after in the future, will get sanatorium treatment, and will get a breakdown allowance for the rest of their lives. The noble Earl opposite (Lord Selborne) knows that under decks and in the engine rooms there is a great deal of phthisis in the Navy, and by a provision which certainly is not ungenerous these men get that treatment in addition to their sickness pension if they have a sickness pension for sickness contracted during service. As to agricultural labourers, special provision is made for them because of the custom which prevails in many districts with regard to sickness benefit; they can join societies, in which case they and their employers will each put down one penny. In the case of seamen in foreign-going ships, because the Merchant Shipping Acts already impose a heavy liability on them we have provided especially for them here by clauses which I am glad to say represent the work largely of the ship-owners. The Government owes a great deal to Sir Norman Hill, who negotiated these matters and enabled them to produce a system which will not only be good for the shipowners, but which will, I think, materially improve the condition of oceangoing civilian seamen.<lb/>
One word about the doctors. They will be dealt with by the local insurance committees. The doctors will not be worse off than those who are now associated with friendly societies. On an average they will probably be 2<i>s</i>. per head better off than they are now. It is extraordinary how little they get from the friendly society. I had a case the other day where
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0385"/>
<col>761</col>
I had an opportunity of ascertaining what the local doctor got from the friendly society. He received about 3<i>s</i>. a head, and his ordinary fee for attending a working-class patient was not more than 1s. 6<i>d.</i> That is outside the friendly society system, and of his fees he recovered only 14<i>s.</i> in the &#x00A3;1. That shows how difficult is the position very often of the country doctor. Now he will get his money for certain under this system, and he will be better off to the extent probably of, on an average, 2<i>s.</i> a head. But that is not all. Under a provision in the Bill the local health committee, after inquiry, can determine what is the rate of wages in a district above which people ought to employ their own doctors at their own charges and make their own arrangements with them. If they think that a man with 30<i>s.</i> a week, having regard to the average income of the industrial classes in the locality, may be properly left to deal with his own doctor, they will fix that rate for that locality, and pay him the ordinary doctor's fee under the scale and leave him with the aid of that fee to supplement it from his own resources and make his own arrangements with the doctor. There is great elasticity left to the insurance committee in dealing with the doctor, and I trust that a little experience will prove that there is no cause for friction.<lb/>
Now just a word or two about the other part of the Bill as to unemployed insurance, which, as I have said, my noble friend behind me (Lord Beauchamp) will deal with more fully later on. At the present time there is only a comparatively small proportion of the industrial population insured against unemployment, and in certain trades&#x2014;shipbuilding and engineering, and the group of trades under those heads&#x2014;there is a great deal of unemployment because the employment is seasonal in character. At one period of the year there is plenty of employment, and at another period very little. The system of insurance against unemployment extends only to those trades, but there is power, after inquiry, to extend it to other trades. The scheme is a weekly allowance paid through the Labour Exchanges and the existing trade unions. The effect of the scheme will be to substitute for about 350,000 people, now insured against unemployment voluntarily in their societies in these scheduled trades, about 2,500,000 in all, which is an enormous increase in
<col>762</col>
the number of people thus secured. The workmen will pay about &#x00A3;1,000,000, the employers about &#x00A3;900,000, and the State about &#x00A3;750,000. These sums will be raised by contributions of 2&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> by the workmen, 2&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> by the employer, and the rest from the State. Then there are provisions in the Bill to encourage employers to keep on their men, even though they may have to diminish the amount of employment they give them. So long as they give them continuous employment and do not discharge them merely because things are slacker than at other times, they get a diminution in their contributions which is worth considering. The unemployment benefit is 7<i>s.</i> a week given for not more than fifteen weeks. Moreover, there is no payment for the first week. That is in order to shut out the man who figures as unemployed because he is not keen to work. Again there are provisions for the person who is really hard-working and keen. For instance, if a workman has paid for 500 weeks and reaches the age of 60, either he or his representatives may get the balance of the payments standing to his credit over the cost of benefits which he has actually received. Then, again, there are cases in which the workman fails because of his incapacity and want of skill. In such cases there is power on the part of the insurance officers to send him to a technical school and pay for his instruction so as to fit him for employment. Generally speaking, a man cannot go out of employment and say, "I am unemployed"; he has to take the employment offered him by the State, and if he does not take it and there is no reasonable excuse for his not doing so he does not get on the to unemployed fund. It is only the man who is unemployed through no fault of his own and who cannot get employment who gets the benefit of the system. There is also a clause providing for payments out of the moneys provided by Parliament to voluntary societies making payments to workmen, whether they are in an insured trade or not, whilst unemployed.<lb/>
To sum up the alterations which have been made in this Bill since it was introduced in the House of Commons in May, they are broadly these. Separate Insurance Commissioners; extension of consumption treatment beyond the sanatorium to the women and children of the family as well as to the man himself; sick pay for
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0386"/>
<col>763</col>
twenty-six weeks instead of thirteen; wage earners of less than 9<i>s.</i> a week free from the obligation to contribute; soldiers and sailors, and mercantile civilian seamen brought in under the special enactment to which I have referred; the changes in the case of married women which I have described; special clauses dealing with agricultural labourers, and a variety of other benefits. Clerks also get the benefit of these arrangements which can be made under the special scheme; the margin of contribution under the Bill as originally proposed has been somewhat reduced, but it is still a good 6 per cent., which is ample, to cover even what might be called depredations, and it is a margin which has been well justified by the actuaries. This is a Bill which must to a certain extent be speculative. I am aware that in all cases our <i>data</i> are not <i>data</i> which can be said to be reliable, but in the main, and taken in bulk, the <i>data</i> which we have are, we think, sufficient to ensure that the scheme will work out as has been calculated, provided the limits of the framework are observed. As we know, there must take place modifications in the direction of the readjustment of the system and of the benefits within those limits, and I cannot but say for myself that it seems to me the sooner this Bill comes into operation the better. The sooner it comes, the sooner shall we get the experience which is requisite. No amount of discussion, even if it went on for years, could make us more certain, or make us certain at all, about many of the points that arise, but that is no reason for not introducing the system. Germany went into national insurance upon the basis of working experimentally and gradually adapting itself to the system.<lb/>
This Bill has been before Parliament since the 4th of May last It has been discussed in the other House during the summer, during the autumn, and during the winter Even during the recess my right hon. friend was active everywhere, and many other people were engaged in discussing the Bill and its provisions; it has been criticised by the friendly societies, by the actuaries of the insurance companies, and by every kind of expert. Modifications have been introduced in it, and I do not wonder that many Amendments were sure to result from a process of criticism of that kind. We may not have yet got to the end of possible modifi-
<col>764</col>
cation, but I do think we have got to a point at which actual experience would be more valuable than anything else; and it is because I believe that we have got a framework and a financial foundation which is secure and upon which we can build, that it seems to me that actual experience is now justifiable as our next resort.<lb/>
The Bill must have other important effects which it is desirable to call into existence at once. There is for example, the prevention of disease. Take the case of children alone. At present, as your Lordships know, under an Act which became law recently&#x2014;the Notification of Births Act&#x2014;children have a better chance of life and health than they had before. That Act merely says that the birth is to be notified to the medical officer of health as well as under the old system to the registrar of births. The medical officer of health pays a visit to the child, and then the voluntary health society&#x2014;these societies are springing up everywhere&#x2014;comes into operation, and in many cases visits the child and watches over it from infancy until it reaches the school age. I know, from my own experience of the work of societies to which I subscribe, that that work is being done now, and it is a work which would be immensely stimulated by this Bill. Then from five years of age to fourteen there are now medical inspection and treatment in the schools, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has promised a further grant next year in aid of those local bodies which have to provide for medical inspection in the schools. I am sorry to say there is still a gap between the age of 14 and 16, and I wish that gap could be filled up by the establishment of the continuation school system which is actually in force in Scotland at the present time, and which was promised for England by a Bill which unfortunately was dropped this session. After the age of 16 the friendly societies begin to look after the life of the young man or woman. It seems to me that we have here a system which ought to do much in the way of preventing disease and towards enabling us to obtain that necessary scientific and statistical knowledge. Take, for instance, phthisis. It surely will be possible to stamp that disease out when you have every case tracked down and watched as you will have under the Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0387"/>
<col>765</col>
My Lords, these things open up a vista ahead, and they may not all be realised. Anticipations are often disappointed, and one's most sanguine ideas, based even on the greatest care and study, too often fail; but this Bill does give some of us hope, and such are the aspirations of those who have framed it. It is a step forward towards the realisation of an ideal of a yet greater and more general character. I can conceive no ambition more noble than the ambition of making the race better physically and morally. I know of no care of the soul which does not involve the care of the body as its indispensable concomitant. I know of no system by which the condition of the race can be raised which does not turn on supervision and precaution and upon the elimination of the causes of evil, such as can only be compassed by a great national scheme. Whatever be the result of this measure, whether it realises its expectations or whether it does not, the spirit in which my right hon. friend has entered into his task is a noble one, and I claim for him the admiration of those who, whether they agree with the results or not, believe in the work of a man who puts his wholes heart and soul into the task he has undertaken.<lb/>
It may be, my Lords, as I have said, that these things will not turn out to the utmost of our expectations, but, on the other hand, for the reasons I have endeavoured to state, I believe that a foundation has been laid from which we may hope for much. We who sit here and those who sit in the other House are the trustees of a great opportunity, and what we have to consider is whether on the balance of our doubts, on the balance of advantages and disadvantages, the time has not come when we ought to take advantage of it. There may be, I believe there will be, hereafter a time when men will look back to the work of those who were legislators in this generation, who sat in these Houses in this year, and who passed this Bill, and will say that they launched a new influence, an influence for good, an influence for the fashioning of character, an influence that has opened a new power both for our generation and for the generations that are to come after us.</membercontribution></p>

<col>766</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02518"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MAKQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all, I am sure, ready to admit the moderation of tone and the mastery of the subject which characterised the speech to which we have just listened. It has, I have no doubt, added much to the knowledge which the House possesses of this intricate and complex subject, and for that contribution to its literature we shall all be grateful. I observe that a few days ago the noble Earl who sits beside the noble Viscount told his hearers on a public occasion that he doubted whether there were more than a dozen people who understood the Bill now before us, and with becoming modesty he hesitated to include himself in that Dumber. The speech of the noble Viscount may possibly have added two or three recruits to that intelligent, but exiguous, band, but I am afraid that he has left a good many of us not quite satisfied and not quite so convinced as he is that this Bill is in all respects a perfect measure. We are, however, grateful to the noble Viscount for his statement, and let me add that we are grateful to His Majesty's Government for having supplied us with the printed Memoranda that lie on the Table&#x2014;documents which must have cost the compilers a great deal of trouble to prepare, but which summarise the contents of this Bill in a very convenient shape.<lb/>
My Lords, I have risen in my place because it seems to me that it would be more convenient at this early stage that the House should be made aware of the manner in which we on this Bench regard the situation that confronts us. It is a remarkable situation, whether we consider the measure that we are now invited to discuss or the particular moment in our Constitutional history at which that measure comes before us. Let me say in the first place&#x2014;and here I take up what I might almost call the challenge which fell from the noble Viscount&#x2014;that we on this side of the House desire to disclaim altogether anything like hostility to the principle of this Bill. I am sure we have listened with satisfaction to the tribute which the noble Viscount paid to the increase of thrift among the working classes of this country, and I am sure that there is no member of this House who would not with his whole mind support any well-considered proposal by which that admirable tendency might be stimulated and encouraged. Many of us are publicly
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0388"/>
<col>767</col>
committed to the principle of the Bill. Several of those who habitually act with us have co-operated, I venture to think usefully, with His Majesty's Government in its discussion, and I will go further and say that in my belief if the fortunes of political war were to bring about a change in the position of the two Parties we ourselves should probably be found ready to deal with this great question. But, my Lords, I venture to add that these feelings on our part must not be regarded as in any sense debarring us from the right to criticise freely either the contents of the Bill or still more the precipitation with which it has been brought before us on this occasion. The noble Viscount will, I am sure, be the last to contend that such criticism as the measure has encountered has been futile or superfluous or other than helpful.<lb/>
Is it, then, the case that there is no more to be said? Is the noble Viscount prepared to tell the House that his Bill is beyond the reach of further criticism? Can he even claim with confidence, and he did put forward the claim, that the foundations of the Bill are well and truly laid? No one would, I think, have judged from the speech of the noble Viscount as we listened to his easy periods that there was throughout the country such an amount of uneasiness and misgiving with regard to the effect of the measure as I believe to exist at this moment throughout the United Kingdom. My Lords, this measure is a stupendous measure. It leaves a considerable part of the field of insurance untouched, but it, nevertheless, affects the whole fabric of society in this country. People are, I think, too fond of discussing this Bill as if it was one which merely concerned the comparatively limited interests of certain classes of the community. It affects the whole community. It is not merely a question of placating the friendly societies, or throwing a sop to the doctors, or to any other aggrieved class. There is a great deal more in it than that.<lb/>
I call it a stupendous measure because, in the first place, it is a stupendous measure of taxation. The noble Viscount admitted, I think rightly, that the question of finance formed one of the most important aspects of the Bill. His Majesty's Government plead guilty, I understand, to a cost to the country which will, by the year 1932&#x2013;3,
<col>768</col>
have risen to something like &#x00A3;26,000,000. That sum capitalised would represent about &#x00A3;1,000,000,000. But some of us have not forgotten the extraordinary miscalculations which took place in regard to old-age pensions. We remember how the estimate of the cost of that measure rose from, &#x00A3;6,000,000 to &#x00A3;13,000,000, and eventually to something like &#x00A3;20,000,000 sterling. There are many who are deeply convinced that in this case also there has been a great underestimate of the ultimate cost. I have seen an estimate, apparently proceeding from high authority, which places the total ultimate cost at no less than &#x00A3;40,000,000 sterling; a sum which capitalised would represent an addition of no less than &#x00A3;1,600,000,000 to the liabilities of the nation. My Lords, that is an enormous liability.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02519"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess appreciates that that is not out of taxes. That is the total cost to employers and employed. The State liability is much less.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02520"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Whether the noble Viscount has regard to the part of the sum raised by taxation or to the cost met from other sources, it is, I maintain, a vast addition to the financial burden which this country will have to bear, and it comes at a moment when the country is already reeling beneath the financial burdens accumulated on its shoulders and when the credit of the country has reached a lower point than has been known within our time. The noble Viscount may say "If you want to have national insurance you must pay for it." That is a perfectly just observation, but I venture to dwell on the great cost of the measure, because it docs seem to me that in such circumstances the country is entitled to ask for precise information as to the amount of liability in which it is going to be engaged It has a right to be satisfied that the finance of this measure is watertight. It has a right to ask whether all this money goes to the right people and whether any classes which ought to be provided for are left out in the cold; and whether any of the money is wasted. So far as I have been able to study the subject it seems to me to be extremely difficult to answer all these questions in a satisfactory manner.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0389"/>
<col>769</col>
If the Bill is so satisfactory to all concerned why is it that every day brings us some fresh protest or remonstrance from some part of the country? I do not like to weary your Lordships with an account of the representations I myself have received with regard to this Bill. I have received them from great chambers of commerce, those of Glasgow, Newcastle, and Exeter among them; from merchants and traders in Edinburgh. Glasgow, Aberdeen, Wigan, and London; from great agricultural organisations; from some of the most important friendly societies, including the Hearts of Oak Benefit Society, the Manchester Unity Friendly Society, the United Friendly Societies Assurance Company, and the National Union of Holloway Societies with a membership of 100,000. There have been public meetings all over the country. There was a meeting the other evening in the City of Manchester at which 900 firms were represented concerned in 200 different trades, and at which over 16,000 signatures were collected. I have had remonstrances from the General Federation of Trade Unions, and it is rather remarkable to find trade unions coming to your Lordships' House to protect them against the rash legislation of His Majesty's Government. Then there are the doctors, the shipbuilders, the clerks, and even agricultural labourers have sent me remonstrances. Surely there is not likely to be all this smoke unless there is a certain amount of fire behind it.<lb/>
May I say half a dozen words with regard to some of the interests most affected by the Bill. In the first place, let me take the friendly societies. I was very glad to hear the noble Viscount recognise the importance of the place that the friendly societies occupy in our social system. We have, it seems to me, every reason to be grateful to them for the part they have hitherto played, and I am glad to find that in this Bill His Majesty's Government desire, so far as possible, to lean upon them and to respect their wishes. I noted that the noble Viscount urged particularly that what he called the <i>esprit de corps</i> of the friendly societies should so far as possible be respected, but I cannot help thinking that on that point he has not given entire satisfaction. It is quite true that the larger societies find themselves in a very strong position under the Bill. Their liabilities are assumed to some extent, and
<col>770</col>
their reserves are liberated. They are, as the noble Viscount truly said, able to select their own lives, and the result of this Bill will probably be to make their position ever stronger than it is now.<lb/>
But then what about the smaller societies? The noble Viscount will remember that when this Bill first saw the light only societies numbering more than 10,000 members were to have been allowed to retain their present position of independence. That limit, I am glad to say, has been reduced to 5,000; but my Lords, below the 5.000 limit there are a number of solvent and respectable societies, who greatly resent the idea of being grouped with other societies. They greatly resent the idea of, their being made to bear the deficits or to share the surpluses of the societies with which they are grouped, and they resent the effects of this Bill because it seems to them, and I think seems to them naturally, to diminish their independence and to deprive them of that individuality to winch they attach the greatest importance. It is typical of the manner in which this Bill was put through the other House of Parliament that an Amendment, which seems a not unreasonable Amendment, for reducing the limit of membership to 1,000 did not even receive any discussion at all.<lb/>
The friendly societies, as the noble Viscount is probably well aware, are greatly exercised in their minds in regard to one particular point&#x2014;I mean the proposal that sick pay, instead of running as now, under the old <i>r&#x00E9;gime,</i> from the first day, should run from the fourth day only of the insurer's sickness. That has occasioned them profound dissatisfaction, and I understand that they are also by no means satisfied with the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for dealing with the sum of something over half a million, which is liberated by that arrangement.<lb/>
May I say one word with regard to the case of the hospitals?. This Bill has greatly disturbed and alarmed those who are interested in the voluntary hospitals of this country. I am bound to say it seems probable that things will go hard with them under the Bill. They have hitherto received very generous support, and particularly from the working classes them-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0390"/>
<col>771</col>
selves. There are many of them who depend largely upon the small weekly subscriptions of the working men, supplemented, no doubt, by a regular subsidy from the firms by whom they are employed. What the managers of those hospitals feel is that, when the men are obliged to provide 4<i>d.</i> for sickness insurance and 2&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> for unemployment insurance, they will hesitate to continue that regular subscription which they have been in the habit of paying to the hospital fund, and the same thing, no doubt, will be the case with regard to the subscriptions of the employers. I noticed the other day a statement by Sir Henry Burdett, who has a right to be heard on the subject of voluntary hospitals, that this Bill meant "the death of voluntary hospitals": that it would have the effect of diminishing their income by one-half, and oblige them to close half the beds which they are at present able to maintain. That is a matter which certainly, to my mind, deserves the consideration of his Majesty's Government.<lb/>
Then there is the case of the doctors. I know that His Majesty's Government have made almost superhuman efforts to propitiate the doctors, and they are quite right. But have they succeeded? I never open my newspaper without seeing a fresh protest from the doctors, and I think we must all feel great sympathy with them. Doctors with a working-class practice are probably amongst the most hard-worked and worst remunerated of our professional men. Some of the points which they have urged have, no doubt, been met, but some are still unsatisfied. The position in which doctors will find themselves under the Bill is not a very enviable one. They will be at the mercy, on the one hand, of the health committees, on which the representatives of the friendly societies are in a majority, and they are also, as I under- stand the Bill, entirely at the mercy of the Insurance Commissioners, who at any moment can strike a medical man off the panel, and thereby ruin his professional prospects. I cannot help thinking that His Majesty's Government, if they desire the Bill to work smoothly and successfully, should be at pains to satisfy the doctors on the points which they have raised. I wonder whether the noble Viscount has noted a movement which appears to be on foot for the establishment of a National Medical Union, the object of which is, I understand, to resist the effects of the Bill. A movement
<col>772</col>
of that kind is not a negligible one, and I cannot help thinking that at this point, also, His Majesty's Government might do more than they have done to meet the representations which have been made to them.<lb/>
With regard to the employers, the noble Viscount must be aware that amongst that class, also, the greatest uneasiness prevails. They ask themselves where these millions which the noble Viscount tells us they will have to contribute are to come from. Are they to come out of the wage fund? At this moment the general complaint amongst the working classes is that the cost of living is increasing and that wages are not increasing to a corresponding extent. Are they to employ fewer men? One of the objects of this Bill is to meet the evil of unemployment. Is the money to come out of the profits of trade? That is rather a serious look-out if that is the source from which the money is to be found. Does not that imply a new burden upon the commerce of the country, a new burden which it is not by any means prepared to bear? I met a gentleman not many hours ago connected with the engineering business. He told me that he believed that this Bill would put &#x00A3;30 on to the price of every locomotive built in this country for export. The noble Viscount reassured us by citing the example of Germany. He told us that in Germany employers are quite content to accept these responsibilities, but the noble Viscount forgot the little difference between the case of our manufacturers and the manufacturers of Germany. The manufacturers of Germany are not, as our manufacturers are, entirely at the mercy of unrestricted free imports.<lb/>
A word as to the working classes. The working classes notoriously desire a National Insurance Bill, and one would have thought that they would be scrambling over one another to obtain this Bill, with all the attractions of that 9<i>d.</i> for 4<i>d.</i> which is held out as a bait. As far as I am able to ascertain the facts of the case, the working people regard the Bill with the utmost suspicion. They are asking themselves a number of questions. They find out that the 9<i>d.</i> provides them only with part of the benefits which they at present receive under the best friendly societies. They have discovered that the Government 2<i>d.</i> is not really 2<i>d.</i> at all, but a fraction which
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0391"/>
<col>773</col>
may vary and which does not by any means necessarily amount to <i>2d</i>. They find that there is nothing for the man who is incapacitated and incapable of earning what is called a living wage. Then there is, I believe, among the working classes a widespread apprehension of the inquisition into their private affairs which is likely to take place under the Bill. They know they will be liable to a kind of supervision which will differ very largely from the kind of supervision to which they have been used under the friendly societies. There are other points which they regard with a certain amount of misgiving. For example, the taxation of young lives to meet the deficit on older lives, the equal contribution demanded from all trades, whether healthy or unhealthy, the equal contribution from all incomes, whether larger or rather smaller; and last, but not least, the needless in- elusion in the Bill of certain classes who are perfectly well able to take care of themselves. These are all points on which the working classes are, I believe, anxious and disturbed in their minds.<lb/>
But there is one class of those who are affected by this Bill whose case seems to me hardest of all. I refer to the deposit contributors. I do not believe there is any point of the Bill at which its inequitable operation stands out more clearly. These are the poorest and the worst organised class in the whole community. They stand most of all in need of assistance, and under this Bill they get less assistance than any other class. In the first place, it must be remembered that the right which the friendly societies possess of selecting their own lives&#x2014;necessarily the best lives&#x2014;must have the effect of driving a great number of people into the class of deposit contributors. I understand that at this moment there are something like 800,000 who will come under the class of deposit contributors, and it is anticipated that that class will be very largely increased.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02521"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Diminished. They must be very largely diminished as the friendly societies continue to take the young lives in at 16. The large number of deposit contributors arises from the fact of the lives being old. Many of the friendly societies will not take old lives but they do not discriminate between lives at 16 to any extent.</membercontribution></p>
<col>774</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02522"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Is the noble Viscount advised that 800,000 is probably the maximum of the deposit contributors?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02523"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, as soon as all the deposit contributors who are to come in come in under the compulsory clause the numbers should go down each year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02524"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I will take that from the noble Viscount, although my information leads me to a different anticipation. He is more familiar with the subject than I am. My point is this, that this class of deposit contributors really get nothing that can be called insurance in the proper sense of the word. All that the deposit contributor gets is a right limited by the amount of his own contribution. Let me take the case of a man whose contributions, including his own and the employer's and the contribution of the State, amount altogether to 8&#x2153;. a week. At the end of a year, supposing the man has been employed 50 weeks, and that is a generous assumption, he finds himself with 35<i>s</i>. to his credit. From that 35<i>s</i>. would have to be deducted the charges for the medical benefit, for administration, and for sanatoria, totalling to 13<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. That leaves the deposit contributor with a balance to his credit of only 21<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. Supposing that the case of the maternity benefit arises, the man's account will be bankrupt. That seems to me to be a weak point in the Bill and one deserving of attention.<lb/>
There is another matter which I must say fills me with considerable apprehension, and that is the administrative; difficulties which will arise when this Bill comes into operation. I understand, according to the reports of the actuaries, that it is anticipated that we shall have eventually to deal with a total a little below 18,000,000 of contributors. What an appalling figure that is. That means 18,000,000 separate accounts; it means a vast amount of correspondence, a vast amount of inspection, and a vast amount of collecting in small sums. Just consider for a moment the immense army of officials that will be necessary in order to superintend the working of this machinery. I have before now ventured to express my concern at the manner in which we are adding to the official army of this country. If the noble Viscount could keep his Territorial battalions up to strength in the same manner
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0392"/>
<col>775</col>
as His Majesty's Government keep their official army up to strength, there would be nothing to complain of. Let it be remembered that under this new dispensation the agents would have to supervise all these accounts and those who contributed to them, and to exercise a supervision infinitely more strict than anything to which the people have hitherto been used. Under the new system you will have people brought in under the friendly societies whom the Chancellor of the Exchequer described as new and undisciplined members and who will want a great deal of looking after. Do not let us forget that if the supervision is not strict, is not somewhat inquisitorial, the so-called minimum benefit may find itself considerably reduced. I understand that the expenses of management of the industrial insurance companies of which the Board of Trade takes cognisance amount to something like 17 per cent., and we shall be indeed fortunate if the amount of supervision expenses in this case does not exceed that percentage. Take it at 25 per cent. and you will have &#x00A3;5,000,000 that will not go to the necessitous people we desire to help, but which will be poured away in salaries and expenses of management.<lb/>
And whilst this new official army will be enormously costly and vastly numerous, it will also be immensely powerful. Take the Insurance Commissioners; their powers are enormous, there is scarcely anything they cannot do under the Bill and under the regulations. I do not know that there need be any limit at all to their powers. With them rests the control of the relations between the approved societies and the insured persons. They can withdraw approval from any society. They control the local health committees. They can include some persons and exclude others. They have the power of penalising individuals without appeal, a not unusual feature in the Liberal legislation of the present day. Unless I am misinformed, the clause constituting this new department was passed in another place under the guillotine without discussion. On all these points that I have touched upon it seems to me that there are doubts to be removed, misgivings to be allayed, and inequalities which require to be redressed.<lb/>
Can we be surprised that this should be so when we consider the history of this
<col>776</col>
measure. It was introduced without any previous investigation, so far as I am aware, by the Government. I do not believe there is any precedent for any measure of social legislation of this magnitude ever having been attempted without some previous inquiry. I have no doubt there were some communications with the friendly societies, but there was nothing like a full and proper inquiry into the whole subject in all its branches. The noble Viscount referred to the precedent of Germany which he said, was instructive. I am told that in Germany there were inquiries which lasted three or four years before any legislation was attempted in regard to national insurance. Even then, as we are aware, that legislation turned out unsatisfactory at a good many points and had to be the subject of legislative amendment. Yet we know as a fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer expected to get his Bill through Parliament in the month of August this year. Now it comes to this House swollen with innumerable Amendments and scarcely recognisable by those who studied the original Bill. At every stage of its progress it has been tinkered and transformed, and now in, I might almost say, the last hours of the session we are asked to address ourselves seriously to the task of revising this Bill. The original Bill contained 87 clauses and covered 78 pages. The Bill now on the Table contains 115 clauses and covers 140 pages. There is hardly a paragraph of the Bill that has not been rewritten and transformed. In the Committee stage of the House of Commons on Part I of the Bill no fewer than 32 clauses were put through without detailed discussion; 18 new Government clauses were put through in a single night under the guillotine. On the Report stage 77 clauses were not discussed at all, and 70 were altered by the Government without discussion. No fewer than 470 Government Amendments were put through on the Report stage. As to Part II, which was sent to a Committee upstairs, 16 out of 25 clauses were not discussed at all on the Report stage. It is quite true that a great many of these alterations were made in order to meet criticism, but will it be contended that because that is so the right of free discussion which has hitherto been extended to us on every great Bill should not be allowed on this? My Lords, I venture to think that we Unionists were not unreasonable when we asked that the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0393"/>
<col>777</col>
House of Commons should not part with this Bill until it had been further considered. And I cannot but think that the Government were not reasonable when they met that demand by the charge that we desired to wreck and obstruct the Bill.<lb/>
I come to the vital question which we have to ask ourselves this evening&#x2014;What ought this House to do with the Bill on the Table? Perhaps we ought first to ask what can we do. We naturally turn to that fragment of a written Constitution with which His Majesty's Government presented the country in the month of August. Under the Parliament Act this House has a right in ordinary cases to claim three rejections preceded by a period of two years for the examination of a doubtful measure, but in this case I am not sure that the conditions laid down by the Parliament Act have been complied with. Under that Act this House is entitled to a full period of one month before it disposes of a measure. We are to be put off with a few days only, and I therefore take it that, if we were to reject this Bill, that rejection could not be counted as one of the three rejections to which we are entitled. That seems at any rate arguable. If I am right, we are in this position: that we could, if we stood upon our privileges, claim four rejections altogether and a period of two years, dating not from the Second Reading this last spring, but from the Second Reading of the measure next year whenever it might be reintroduced into the House of Commons. That would extend our period of delay to a date somewhere in the year 1914.<lb/>
But we are bound to ask ourselves what we should gain, what the country would gain, were we to insist upon our full rights. I venture to suggest that we ought to think twice before we embark upon a conflict which would inevitably be long and bitter, and would probably be also infructuous. Our attitude, as I conceive, is anything but one of uncompromising hostility to this Bill. We wish it to be dealt with; we do not desire that there should be any needless delay. I agree with the noble Viscount when he told us that in his view a long postponement of legislation upon this subject would be for many reasons most unfortunate. But even if we were to claim the full period to which we are entitled, could we have
<col>778</col>
any security that the Bill would in the meantime be materially improved? Now noble Lords opposite would not be able to alter and improve the Bill because they would have to return it to us under the Parliament Act in the identical shape in which they presented it at first. We, on the contrary, on our side would probably stand a very poor chance of obtaining in such circumstances a calm and dispassionate consideration for the Amendments we might desire to suggest.<lb/>
But quite apart from the attitude which the Government might be expected to adopt in reference to changes proposed by your Lordships, we have this most important point to consider. This Bill is not a Money Bill, but it is a Bill which spells money at every clause, and I regard it as absolutely certain that if your Lordships were to set to work to alter and amend it, you would be met at every turn by the claim of House of Commons privilege. We have had in this house painful experience of the manner in which that claim has been insisted upon by the other House of Parliament. I am sure many of your Lordships remember a leading case that occurred when we were dealing with the Old Age Pensions Bill, when an Amendment which everybody knew was an improvement was contemptuously sent back by the House of Commons, and when the Prime Minister observed that the moment was not one for relaxing the privilege of the House of Commons. And yet we all know the Amendment was afterwards embodied in a Bill which was passed with everybody's consent. Therefore I should not look forward with any hopeful anticipation to a struggle with the other House of Parliament over the amendment of the Bill on the Table. I am afraid that if we were to hold up this Bill for amendment, we should find ourselves embarked in a long and bitter controversy in which the hands of this House would virtually be tied. There would be regrettable delay, our action would be misrepresented, and in the end we should be able to achieve very little.<lb/>
We have no wish either to wreck or to defer the operation of the Bill for two or three years. What we hoped for was that there would be breathing space given in the other House of Parliament, breathing space for the classes affected, breathing space for His Majesty's Government to take
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0394"/>
<col>779</col>
stock and to amend their Bill, breathing space above all for the House of Commons, which is not hampered by privilege, to deal with the measure in whatever way might seem to it necessary. That interval might have been turned to good account. There might have been an inquiry&#x2014;a Royal Commission or Joint Committee, I do not care which&#x2014;to examine the possibility of correcting some of the blots in the Bill which might then have come up to your Lordships' House, not as the hurried outcome of a confused controversy, but as representing the deliberate and matured judgment of the other House of Parliament. But that breathing space, as we all know, was refused peremptorily, and we know very well why. We know that the Government have other liabilities to meet next Session of Parliament and we know that the inclusion of this Bill between the interstices of Home Rule, Household Suffrage, and Welsh Disestablishment, would not have been exactly convenient to His Majesty's Ministers. From the moment that reasonable request was refused in the House of Commons it does not seem to me to matter greatly whether this House takes a few days more or less for the examination of this Bill.<lb/>
May I say one word as to an alternative proposal, which has received a good deal of influential support? It has been suggested that your Lordships might pass this Bill tacking on to it a clause under which it would be necessary that the measure should be referred to a poll of the people. That is, I admit, a plausible and attractive suggestion, but I should be slow to recommend it to your Lordships. I think there are obvious reasons against it. In the first place, there is at this moment on the Statute-book no machinery for the Referendum. If we were to endeavour to legislate for that purpose we should find ourselves involved in a controversy, not on the merits of the Bill, but on the merits of the Referendum as a piece of Constitutional machinery. What seems to me more serious still is that if this procedure were to be adopted the electors would be placed in the position of having to choose between the Government Bill and no Bill at all. That is not a dilemma we should like to face. We desire the Bill to pass, but we desire it to be reconsidered in very important particulars. I am afraid that resort to the Referendum in these circumstances would
<col>780</col>
only result in a misleading, and, therefore, mischievous verdict. Our choice, then, I conceive, is between the alternatives indicated by the noble Viscount in his speech. We have to choose between this Bill, with all its defects, with all the friction and the litigation to which we believe it will lead, with all its mistakes, some of them, I am afraid, irreparable&#x2014;we have to choose between this Bill and two or three years of acute and distracting controversy between the two Houses, controversy, which, as I pointed out just now, would probably in the end be absolutely fruitless.<lb/>
My Lords, we have come to the conclusion that the acceptance of the Bill is the wiser course for this House to take. There is only one thing which we will not advise your Lordships to do, and to which I certainly decline to be a party&#x2014;I mean a sham attempt to revise this Bill in the few days that remain to us&#x2014;an attempt that would be handicapped, on the one hand, by the limited time at our disposal, and, on the other, by the knowledge that the greater part of the Bill is of a nature which we are unable to touch or to amend. Such an attempt would be made with a certainty that we could not insist upon most of our Amendments, and, worse than that, that we should be saddled with a share of responsibility for the injustice and extravagance which are written large upon many of the provisions of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02525"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDHURST</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with what has just been said by the noble Marquess. I personally would most willingly have welcomed more time for the consideration of this Bill, because it not only affects every household, but has to do with the present and perhaps the future interests of one of our most learned professions, and as it at present stands it may have an everlasting effect upon the fortunes of some of our charitable institutions. I should not have ventured to intrude myself upon your Lordships' notice had it not been for the fact that for the last thirty years I have been concerned in the work and management of some of the large London hospitals which are supported by voluntary contributions, and also that when I had the honour of being Governor of Bombay I had under me, I should think, a greater number of medical officers at one time than ever fell to the lot of an administrator, because those were the days of the beginning of the plague.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0395"/>
<col>781</col>
It is impossible for me to follow my noble friend through every sentence of his speech. I propose to deal only with that portion of the Bill which has reference to the doctors and how they may be affected, and also as to the effects of the Bill on our charitable institutions and hospitals. Before I come to that, I am anxious to ask my noble friend's attention to one or two matters in connection with this Bill which he did not touch upon. One is the question in regard to midwives. Under the Mid wives Act, midwives are now bound under penalty to send for a doctor in cases of necessity, and the local supervising authority at present can pay for this out of the county funds. I should like to know at a future stage whether some arrangement could not be made so that the society might make arrangements for the reimbursement of the fees which will have to be paid to a medical man whom the midwife, as I have said, is under a penalty obliged to call in.<lb/>
With regard to the deposit contributor, I should very much like to see some plan devised and put in the Bill by which the insurance could be paid in a lump sum. By such means the deposit contributor could assume the position of a person insured by a society, or, again, a child could be insured for life or any shorter period by the payment of a lump sum. It is easy to imagine cases arising in which such procedure would be advantageous and advisable, cases, for instance, where people wished to provide for the children of faithful servants, where an employer wished to provide for the children of his <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i>, and for those whom the societies would not take. I believe this is well known as a principle which is taken advantage of by insurance societies; and further than that, I think there would be little trouble in proving the tiling to be financially sound.<lb/>
Then I do not think it is mentioned in the Bill whether the guardians can take maternity relief into consideration as regards applicants for indoor relief. That is to say, would an unmarried woman who is insured be liable to be refused admission to a Poor-law infirmary for confinement on the ground that she was not destitute? At present if she is destitute she can claim to be admitted to those admirable State hospitals. This is a matter of very great importance, because if she is not admitted this unfortunate girl is worse off than she was before. Then it seems necessary, I
<col>782</col>
think, to secure that the maternity benefit paid to the husband shall in reality be applied for the benefit of the wife. I do not think that the question is quite clear as it stands. We all know that it sometimes occurs that women are not tended with all the care necessary, and a bad character might very easily spend the money in drink or on anything else. I should very much like to see that put beyond doubt. It is possible, in fact very probable, that my reading of the clause has not been correct, but my noble friend will, perhaps, be able to inform me of that at a later stage.<lb/>
I listened with very great interest to what my noble friend said in regard to the medical men. We all know that they put forward in the first instance six points through the British Medical Association. Four of those points, I think I am correct in saying, are already embodied in the Bill, and the others can be met under the machinery provided in the Bill, so far as is consistent with the public and professional interests, provided that the financial requirements are satisfactorily adjusted. No doubt there may be difficulties about the arrangements with the doctors. It may not be easy to get the medical profession promptly into administrative line, but we may feel confident, I am sure, that while these arrangements are in the course of making or proceeding to perfection the poor people will not suffer from want of medical attendance. I think that the "flat fee," as it is called, in the case which the noble Viscount mentioned was 3<i>s</i>. As the House knows, the estimate for the "flat fee" was made on the analogy of what is known as "club practice." At present the medical man dealing with the members of a club treats them at a flat fee of, say, 4<i>s.</i> per annum, but I fear that under the working of this Bill it will be found that the conditions and results to the medical man will differ very much from the present club practice. In some respects that is no doubt to be desired, but when the medical man has had his flat fee of <i>4s</i>., he has had into the bargain, in addition to the members of the club, his practice extended to a number of patients who pay fees per visit rather higher than the noble Viscount stated. In the cases I am alluding to they pay as much as 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. or 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and those private patients as a rule form the bulk of his income and practically enable him to take the number of poorer patients at the flat fee. But I think it is reasonable to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0396"/>
<col>783</col>
anticipate, if my noble friend's Bill is going to be a success, that the greater number of these private patients will merge themselves into insurance paying people, and the consequence is that the private patients will disappear and also the margin which enables the medical man to take the poorer patients at a lower fee. I am afraid it will be found that his remuneration will be insufficient.<lb/>
But, again, this ordinary domiciliary attendance at 6<i>s</i>. per annum is really only half the story, because what about the journeys, special cases, minor operations, adenoids, an&#x00E6;sthetics, and so on? All these special services will be in addition to the ordinary work, which of itself can hardly be properly remunerated at the 6<i>s</i>. per annum. It will follow, therefore, that these special services cannot be properly performed or performed at all, and recourse must be had to the hospitals now supported by voluntary contributions. And to show what this means as regards the work of the general medical hospitals at present, I can tell you from my own experience that at one of the largest London hospitals in the summer time it was about two and a-half months before a child could get operated on for adenoids. Then it must be remembered that the insurers will be paying insurance money for this relief, and they will naturally expect it to be administered to them with as little delay as possible; but in addition to these small operations there are countless other medical and surgical cases by which an individual is incapacitated from going to work, and is the society to go on paying while the patient is waiting for a bed as well as during the time that the operation or the treatment is effecting its cure? If so, this will happen, that while you have the great anxiety of the patient to obtain the bed in the hospital you will also have your societies backing him up by urgently appealing for additional hospital accommodation.<lb/>
My Lords, this leads me to the call on the hospitals and their work in connection with this Bill. I give my noble friend this admission, that it is possible&#x2014;indeed, I think it is more than likely&#x2014;that under the Bill the work of an out-patients' department may diminish, that the hundreds of thousands of out-patients will most perceptibly decline. But, on the other hand, there is in connection with the out-patients' department of a large hospital a variety of what are known as special departments
<col>784</col>
where maladies or diseases in connection with the eyes, the ears, the throat, the nose, and a host of other things, are dealt with; special departments efficiently provided with the most expensive and up-to-date apparatus, as well as presided over by the best brains that can be found among very distinguished medical men, I expect the result will be that the pressure upon these departments, instead of diminishing, will be considerably increased in regard to their work. But, after all, it is not the outpatients who are the most costly. The in-patients are the more expensive, and, as I have already shown, the pressure of the numbers of would-be patients, supplemented by the pressure of the societies for beds will, to my mind, cause the necessity of increasing the existing hospital accommodation, and hospital accommodation will be still more necessary than ever.<lb/>
It is possible, of course, that much may in future be done by dispensaries for the treatment of trivial cases. It may be necessary for them to act as clearing houses for different diseases. I cannot help thinking that something of the kind will have to be set up in regard to the sanatorium treatment. But except by taking money from sanatorium benefit for diseases other than tuberculosis I do not see where any funds are to come from to deal with this matter; so we have it again that until some such clearing house system is set up, all the minor cases as well as the more important cases will, as now, be thrown indiscriminately on the general hospitals. Therefore in spite of the desire expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the tone of which I quite appreciate, not to bring in the hospital question. I cannot help thinking that it will open itself with surprising and increasing insistence after this Act has been in operation for some little time. But while there is no money available that I can see for setting up dispensaries, or for giving money to hospitals, there is machinery to a certain extent. I observe that under Clause 20, and I think also under Clause 63, a health committee or a society is empowered to subscribe to hospitals, but no society has funds at its disposal, so far as I can see, outside those allotted to sanatorium and medical benefit, all of which would be required for these particular purposes; and it can hardly be doubted that no society will subscribe to other institutions until at least their first triennial valuation shows a surplus.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0397"/>
<col>785</col>
The liability for the treatment of the sick under the Bill seems to me to be tremendous. Under Clause 8 (<i>b</i>) we find this benefit conferred&#x2014;
<quote>"Treatment in sanatoria or other institutions or otherwise when suffering from tuberculosis, or such other diseases as the Local Government Board, with the approval of the Treasury, may appoint."</quote>
This may embrace the whole of the Pharmacop&#x0153;ia, the whole gamut of disease and medicine and surgery, and your only hope and refuge, except for these medical officers who I venture to think are hardly sufficiently remunerated, will be the general hospitals which are supported now by voluntary contributions; and what makes me anxious about it is this&#x2014;I think this was referred to by the noble Marquess opposite&#x2014;that all the time this work is increasing, and I have not the least doubt it will increase, the difficulty of getting hold of funds is increasing also day by day. I may mention that all these hospitals are attended and served almost entirely by medical men without any pecuniary reward whatever. I am not speaking of the three hospitals known as the "endowed hospitals." Your Lordships know only too well, by the innumerable circulars and appeals you receive daily, the straits to which hospitals are reduced. I have myself sent out thousands upon thousands of appeals. I do not see how their situation is likely to improve; I think it is likely to get worse. As was pointed out by the noble Marquess, employers now contribute very generously to these institutions; in some cases workers, as in the North of England, contribute in various centres, and their subscriptions, made by weekly donations, amount to many thousands of pounds in the year&#x2014;I believe in one place to as much as &#x00A3;17,000. But under this Bill it will be enacted that for medical relief both the working man and his employer shall pay their contributions by another system, and, though I do not adopt the figure which I have seen set out, it has been said that employers will pay seven or eight millions. But one can see very easily that it will cost a great deal of money.<lb/>
I have no doubt that certain employers, rich men and others, will continue to support these charities, but still you cannot expect them when the outgoing is so great&#x2014;is necessarily so great&#x2014;under
<col>786</col>
the Bill to subscribe in the large way they have done before. There are three avenues in this Bill by which assistance might be obtained. I have already referred to the medical sanatorium benefit. I have referred also to the friendly societies and their subscriptions, and also I have remarked, I think, that no well-managed society would give a subscription unless its position in regard to surplus was proved by a proper valuation. But there is a third way, by way of contribution from the rates&#x2014;half from the rates, and half from the Treasury. We who have had to do with these authorities know very well that unavoidable and necessary delays must occur, and in the meantime the position of hospitals gets more serious. It seems to me really necessary that we should have in this Bill, or else in an amending Bill at no very distant date before it is too late, some provision for enacting an institutional benefit to be administered by the committees on the same lines as sanatoria.<lb/>
There is one more point in connection with these hospitals which I think should not be lost sight of, especially in view of what appears in the Memorandum and in view of what was said by my noble friend about the prevention of disease. In connection with these general hospitals, or a great many of these general hospitals, in London and the country are medical schools where lecture rooms, and libraries, and all the paraphernalia of medical education are to be found, as well as the material in the wards and in the out-patients' department for observation and study by the students. But my fear is this, that if these great charities have to any considerable degree in the course of time to shut down in London and the country, medical education will suffer. My noble friend has mentioned it, and I venture to think that this is a matter of very real importance, because the progress of science is bound up with the arrangements which must be made in the Government Bill. We must remember that the success and solvency of the measure depend upon the prevention of disease, and only by an advance in science and the promotion of better methods for preventing disease will the drain on sick funds be diminished, and only as they diminish, I think, will you manage to make your scheme a success.<lb/>
A very important thing is medical ability, and this in its turn depends on
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0398"/>
<col>787</col>
the service under the Bill being such as to attract good men. If the Bill merely extends the undesirable condition of the club or contract practice, I think it will mean that in a future generation recruits for the medical profession may not come up to the high standard of to-day, and the development of preventive medicine depends on enthusiastic labour and co-operation of the best intelligencies. I feel very strongly that the medical charities may suffer, and I am also anxious about the condition of the doctors. It has been mentioned that there may be very great difficulties of administration. I was twenty years ago chairman of an inquiry into metropolitan medical relief by a Committee of this House, and in our Report is found this statement&#x2014;
<quote>"It was suggested that it might be advisable to map out London into districts, so that a person leaving one district, and, therefore, his medical association, would easily attach himself to the medical provident association of another district; but the Committee, while agreeing that such an arrangement would be highly desirable if practicable, doubt whether in London, with its heterogeneous and migratory population, such an organisation would be possible."</quote>
If that was true then&#x2014;and I think it was&#x2014;it is still more true now, because of the increase of population and the greater facilities for moving that population about. I cannot help fearing that the charities will suffer. It is so very easy to interfere with an old system, and possibly to put something up in its place which, however good on paper, you cannot by any means be sure will act efficiently. The older system of charitable relief and the hospitals themselves got on extremely well with the Poor-law authorities and kindred institutions of that description, and I should very greatly regret if their usefulness and efficiency is in any way curtailed by this Bill. No doubt the imperfections of the Bill will be remedied in the course of time as new generations grow up that have become accustomed to the intrusion and inquiry which will be necessitated, and then it will be found to be a vast and widespread benefit. We have been told several times that it has taken about twenty-five years in Berlin to get the thing near perfection. That is an inspiring and cheerful outlook. And if that is so I think we might very easily, if there had been more time, have gone into and revised this Bill, especially as I sincerely hope that the Bill will turn out to be a success and benefit to a great
<col>788</col>
many people. I conclude by expressing my regret once more that we have not had time to remedy some of the imperfections that admittedly exist in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02526"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if it were not for the exigencies under which this House is called upon to consider this Bill, which is one of the longest and most complicated Bills ever put before your Lordships' House, I should have hesitated to intervene in the debate. But as a member of the London County Council I have been asked to draw attention to those features in the Bill in which they and many other local authorities throughout the country are concerned. This Bill sets up a local health committee in every county and in every county borough, the committee to consist of not less than forty members. It is very important to note how the membership of these committees is made up. Only one-fifth of the total membership is to represent local authorities, and three-fifths to represent the persons insured under the Bill. A protest was handed to me just now in regard to these local committees addressed to a member of this House from the Shipbuilding Employers' Federation, representing about seven millions of money. They protest not only against the injustice of the incidence of the Bill, with regard to which I shall have a word to say later, but also against the exclusion of employers from the local health committees. Now if you turn to the composition of these local health committees you will find that local authorities are most inadequately represented. They are only represented by one-fifth of the total membership. These local health committees are to administer medical and sanatoria benefits, and if the funds provided under the Bill are insufficient to meet their estimated expenditure they can apply to the Treasury and to the county councils to sanction the difference between their income and their estimated expenditure.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, what would be the position of the local authority? The Treasury, with the mass of the taxpayers of the United Kingdom at their back, may be willing to sanction this excess of expenditure, but what may be a very slight affair to them may be a very heavy burden to a district, and the local authority for very good reasons may be unwilling
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0399"/>
<col>789</col>
to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement under which the extra burden would be thrown upon the rates. Your Lordships must remember that there is no incentive to economy on the part of the local health committees. They are not responsible to the ratepayers. They are a standing body, and any scheme they want to bring forward, although it may be excellent in itself, may represent a burden which the ability of the district would be totally inadequate to bear. The local authority will be in a very difficult position; they will be placed in the position of having to refuse to give assistance towards objects desirable in themselves and towards which the Treasury have intimated their willing ness to subscribe. The health committee under such circumstances will be in a position to place great pressure on the local authority. They will be able practically to force expenditure on that body to which they will not be disposed. In fact, we shall have an unelected body interfering with and practically controlling an elected body. I understand that it is the intention of the Government by their insurance scheme so to reduce the poor-rate as to compensate the local authority for any extra burden which may be put upon them. But, my Lords, how can this be, the case when the Government's subventions in aid of the rates are already totally inadequate, and have been admitted to be totally inadequate? I would further point out that as the medical benefits affect some 15,000,000 people, a very small proportion of whom are on the poor-rate, any reduction in the poor-rate would be in no way commensurate with the new liabilities which will come on the local authority by these deficiencies in local health committee funds. Your Lord-ships must remember that the medical benefits are going to affect people whose incomes go up to &#x00A3;160 a year, and it is ridiculous to talk of such people being in any way connected with the poor-rate. The local authority, in fact, under the provisions of this Bill will be undertaking a new financial responsibility in respect of vast numbers of people who are in no way connected with the poor-rate.<lb/>
If the Government's contention were correct, if the effect of this Bill were to reduce the poor-rate, and if the Government's subventions were sufficient for local expenditure, which is certainly not the case, even then I should feel compelled to
<col>790</col>
protest against the introduction of an unnecessary complication into the already complicated relations between Imperial and local finance. Those complications, I think, are admitted on both sides of this House. In fact, your Lordships were led to believe that His Majesty's Government were going to deal with the whole of this question of Imperial and local expenditure within the course of this year. Up to now I regret to say that His Majesty's Ministers have so far not seen their way to redeem their pledge. I protest, as I have protested on a former occasion in this House, against the readiness with which Parliament imposes new obligations and new burdens on the ratepayers without the ratepayers consent. I hold that money raised by rates ought to be expended by those bodies who are directly connected with the ratepayers. That principle does not obtain in this Bill. When this Bill was first introduced we were led to believe that the benefits of the Bill would be met by the arrangements for contributions from the employer, the <i>employ&#x00E9;</i>, and the State, which would go to make up the total. But now what is the ease? The employer will pay his fourpence as an employer, but he will also pay an increased amount as a ratepayer. The <i>employ&#x00E9;</i> will pay his subscription, and the State will pay, as the noble Marquess pointed out, something less than a penny of the money, I think it is, and the balance of the burden by this Bill will be divided between Imperial taxation and the rates. Half of it will fall on the rates. I said just now that the Government would give less than a penny, because, in spite of what the noble Viscount said, the two-ninths which the Government pay of benefits when they mature is a very different thing from paying twopence into a fund where it would be allowed to accumulate and earn interest in so far as it was not drawn upon.<lb/>
Now it is true that the State is only deferring the evil day. In effect, what they are doing is pledging future Governments to meet vast and practically unknown liabilities. I think the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition said it would represent something like &#x00A3;1,600,000,000 of capital. Well, quite apart from that, there may be unknown expense and unknown expenditure going to be put on the rates under the clause with which I have just dealt. In any case the financial liabilities with which future Governments will be
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0400"/>
<col>791</col>
faced is bad enough, but I see no reason why in the meantime an unknown and unlimited burden should be placed on the ratepayers. In all previous experimental legislation&#x2014;and surely we are justified in saying that this scheme is experimental&#x2014;a limitation has been put on the amount of the rate which could be imposed If you take the Feeding of School Children Act you will find that a &#x00BD;<i>d</i>. rate was imposed by Parliament; but in this case, if you examine the provision dealing with the relation between local health committees and local authorities, you will see there is no limitation on the burden which can be placed on the rates.<lb/>
As regards the Government's contention as to the effect of insurance on Poor-law expenditure, I think that must be intended to apply to those more fortunate individuals who are able to become members of approved societies. Whatever may be the case in regard to members of approved societies, I have little confidence that those coming under what is known as deposit insurance will in any large numbers be removed from the poor-rate. The noble Marquess dealt just now with the hard case of the deposit and Post Office contributor, and I noticed that the noble Viscount in introducing this Bill said there were 800,000 deposit contributors, and that in future as these young persons could come into the scheme, that probably would diminish. With all respect, I venture to challenge that statement. I have here the actuarial report on this Bill, and I notice this statement&#x2014;
<quote>"As regards the increase in the future of these compulsory contributors who fail to join approved societies and become deposit contributors, it is in the nature of the case almost impossible to make an estimate which will be of any value."</quote>
Then the actuaries go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"On the other hand, their numbers will be recruited not only by those persons entering the scheme in future at the age of sixteen who may fail to join societies, but also by the transfer of a certain number of persons from the ranks of the societies owing to prolonged unemployment."</quote>
The scheme for these persons who are rejected by approved societies is not an insurance scheme, as the noble Marquess remarked this evening. The existence of the Post Office contributor entirely vitiates the claim of this Bill to be called a National Insurance Bill. So far as sickness and disablement benefits are concerned they cease as soon as the amount of the Post
<col>792</col>
Office deposit is exhausted. That man will then have nothing between him and the poor-rate. The freedom of choice as to accepting members which is left to these approved societies, and I think necessarily left to them, will greatly strengthen these societies. They will get all the best lives. The weaker and smaller societies will get the inferior lives; and the worst lives, those who are most in need of insurance, will drift into the Post Office deposit scheme. I think it is an unfortunate feature of this Bill that its whole tendency in working is to separate the strong from the weak, and give most to the strong and least to the weak. It divides up the people of this country into good lives, middling lives, and bad lives, and it is the last who will reap the least benefit from the Bill, although relatively in proportion to their means they pay the most.<lb/>
In a great national scheme in which the principle of compulsion is applied to all, surely there ought to be some attempt at equality of treatment? The Post Office contributor is not the only case of inequality of treatment. It will be seen that at the commencement the scheme applies one flat rate for both young and old. I listened with great interest to the noble Viscount's speech in which as far as I could make out&#x2014;the noble Viscount will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;he said that in order to get the older people into the scheme the great expense would really devolve on the State. I think that is the noble Viscount's contention&#x2014;that the State would be practically paying one penny and five-ninths to enable the older people to come into the scheme on the same flat rate as the younger people. Now, what I make out so far is this. In order to allow the older people to come into the scheme at the same rates a vast sinking fund, amounting to, I think the noble Viscount said, &#x00A3;63,000,000&#x2014;I have made it out to be &#x00A3;66,000,000&#x2014;is to be provided. I make out that that is built up by taking out of the contributions of every member of an approved society a sum amounting to a penny and five-ninths in the case of a man, and 1&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> in the case of a woman. After all, the State&#x2014;the Government, that is&#x2014;pay nothing into this common fund except a liability. They only pay two-ninths of these benefits when they mature, and therefore I cannot understand the noble Viscount's contention that it is the State which is building up this sinking

fund which is going to pay off the deficit caused by these older people coming into the scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02527"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: May I just explain? It is quite true that one penny and five-ninths comes out of what the employer and employed pay, but that is made up by the State paying two-ninths of the benefit. The one balances the other.

If the State paid 2<i>d</i>. into the fund at the present moment, and that fund bore interest, and if they paid in their contribution at once, I could see it; but as they only pay the liability and are only responsible for two-ninths of the benefits when they are approved, I cannot see by any reasoning that you can say the young are not really paying towards the fund more than they need in order that the older people may enter into the scheme. I must apologise to the noble Viscount if he is right, but I really cannot see the noble Viscount's contention.<lb/>
Then to turn to another point in respect of young persons, to a matter in which the London County Council and many other local authorities have taken a deep interest. Under Part I of the Bill, when you come to consider this scheme you will find that, contrary to the whole trend of modern social legislation, this Bill offers direct incentives to the employment of juvenile labour. If you turn to the part of the Bill which deals with health insurance, your Lordships will see that the employer has to make a weekly contribution in
<col>794</col>
respect of each person employed. Certain of the employed are exempted from insurance. A person of 70, or a person having a pension or other property amounting to 10<i>s</i>. a week is exempted from contributions under the Bill&#x2014;he has to make no contribution; but for obvious reasons the employer has to make the same contribution as he makes in respect of other people. There is another class, young persons under the age of 16, who are also exempted from this Bill, and in this case, for some unknown reason, the employer is also exempted from making his payment. When you turn to the part dealing with unemployment insurance the same thing obtains there. Young people up to the age of 16 are exempted from insurance, and again you will find the employer is exempted from making his payment. I can only say the reason is quite extraordinary. One of the greatest evils which we are contending with to-day is the unhappy facility with which young persons get into blind alley occupations, and yet here in a great social reform scheme you find provisions which offer direct incentives to employers to employ juvenile labour. Indeed, there are inducements to enable employers to get rid of these young persons when they reach the age of 16&#x2014;that is, at the insurable age&#x2014;and replace them by other and younger <i>employ&#x00E9;s</i>.<lb/>
My Lords, I am not going to detain you at this hour by going further into a Bill which we have really had no time to consider, a Bill which covers 140 pages of print. There are many of your Lordships in this House who are well acquainted with, and who have worked a good deal at, social work, and who, I know, would have been quite willing to give your services towards making this Bill what it ought to be&#x2014;a beneficial measure to the country. I regret that a vast social reform scheme closely affecting the interests of millions of our people should be forced through the House of Commons under the guillotine and those other instruments whereby free discussion is not satisfied, and that it should be sent to your Lordships' House under circumstances which preclude you from giving it even that attention which would be given to a Bill promoted by a private company in their own interests. It is not thus, my Lords, that the country can look forward to well considered schemes of social reform being placed upon the Statute Book.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0402"/>
<col>795</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02533"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the circumstances in which this Bill comes to your Lordships' House under the very limited powers which are left to us to improve its defects caused by those gaps in the discussion in the other House allow me only briefly to point particularly to Clause 62, upon which I intend to put down one Amendment, because it is to a certain extent outside the actual provisions or the actual purpose of the Bill. The Bill is an Insurance Bill, but Clause 62 adds to it certain penal provisions which have nothing to do really with the question of insurance. To that extent Clause 62, the clause upon excessive sickness, might be said to be beyond the original purview of the Bill. The point to which I wish to call the attention of the House is one of those which was entirely undebated in the House of Commons, and is one of vital importance on general grounds. For any injury or any injustice that may be done to the individual insurer the Bill provides ample legal remedy, and an appeal; but while the penal provisions in Clause 62 may affect individual holders of property to the extent of thousands of pounds, while they may penalise an employer of labour in consequence of the conditions and nature of the employment, which may be in itself one that involves danger and one for which the Legislature has already imposed certain provisions and restrictions which are intended to minimise the danger of that employment, this penalty is imposed by a person who is sent down to inquire, without any of those safeguards which hedge the Judicature and other public bodies, and without any limit as to the amount of penalty he might impose. I do not think that there is any instance of such powers being given to an individual who has no legal position and not even a legal appointment.<lb/>
In a letter which some of your Lordships may have seen in the papers addressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to Sir Ryland Adkins, the Chancellor says that he would sooner withdraw the clause than have the appeal which we propose&#x2014;that is, an appeal from any order made by a person holding an inquiry under this section to two or more of His Majesty's Judges sitting together, on a point of law, or on the merits in respect of the determination or rejection of any evidence, such appeal to be made by any
<col>796</col>
person, company, or authority which feels aggrieved by the decision of the person holding such inquiry, and the decision of such Court of Appeal as then constituted to be final on all issues. Now I intend to put down this Amendment in the Committee stage of the Bill, and my reason for particularly mentioning it in this case is that I have a hope&#x2014;a very faint hope&#x2014;that, even if this Amendment cannot be conceded, at least something may be done to give the person who is making this inquiry some independent position, and to insure that this appointment shall have the sanction of some high judicial authority who will see that his qualifications, his impartiality, and his independence may be equal to the enormous powers which are likely to be put into his hands. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's fear is that if an appeal of this kind is given it may frustrate the objects of the clause. On the other hand, we feel that it may be very likely that the absence of an appeal may act in exactly the same way, because a public health committee might be unwilling to institute such an inquiry when they have over their heads the feeling that, great and difficult as may be the points for discussion, it is an inquiry from the issue of which there is no possible stepping back; and I hope that either some limitation of the amount which may be entrusted to this officer may be made, or else that some greater safeguard than exists at present may be made for the appointment of one who is competent to the task.<lb/>
Then there is one other point I should like to mention in the hope that the noble Viscount will introduce in his reply something upon it. That is the point which was alluded to by Lord Sandhurst with regard to the position of the hospitals. As I take it, under the Bill the position is this, that the subscriptions and the revenues of the hospitals will undoubtedly fall off. The hospitals will be left with empty beds which their funds will not allow them to support, and it is the duty of the health committee and of the friendly society to discover some means by which such cases as require hospital treatment may be met and provided for. The societies will have the power of making terms with the hospitals, and they will presumably have considerable funds with which possibly they may be able to make favourable terms to open those empty
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0403"/>
<col>797</col>
beds of the hospitals. But the health committee, I take it, will only be for the purpose of making arrangements with the hospital as to the medical benefits at their disposal. Therefore the result will be that the hospital beds, so far as they exist, will be filled by members of the various societies and not by those who are Post Office depositors and who come under the local health committees. I think this would be very much to be regretted, because it will be the poorer members and the older people who are not in the societies who will probably require the use of the hospitals most and they will be those against whom the hospitals will have to close their doors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02534"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BANGOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess opposite has enumerated a number of points in this Bill in regard to which great anxiety is felt as to the injury that it may probably, or very likely, cause, and I have to ask myself whether, if he thinks that the Bill here and there on all these points will do great harm, we are in this House acting a patriotic part if we follow the noble Marquess in carrying out what I understood the noble Marquess's view to be-&#x2014;that is, not even in the limited time at our disposal to make some attempt to amend the Bill. I suppose this House has a very large number of experts, men whose authority in finance and philanthropy and in various other ways is second to none, and I ask myself again, Is all that wealth of experience; and knowledge not to be put at the service of the country at a time when a Bill so largely affecting the fortunes of all classes is about to be passed?<lb/>
What is this House for but to try as best it can to revise and make good in such ways as it may the measures that are brought before the country? It is said that we should possibly throw ourselves into collision with the other House. Well, should we? I understood the noble Viscount to deprecate our employing much time in making any Amendments to this Bill. But still are we to understand that, however good an Amendment may be, however well calculated it may be to obviate some of those points on which the Bill is likely to do mischief, the Government will advise the House of Commons to reject thRt Amendment and say that if we insist upon
<col>798</col>
it they will not go on with the Bill? I cannot believe that. The noble Viscount said the foundation was well and truly laid. Surely our plain duty is, if we think there is any inequality in the foundation or anything that will cause the superstructure to fall down, at this hour to make it more effective. I suppose all of us who sit on this Bench were glad to hear that a Bill of this kind was going to be produced. All our lives we have amongst such people been inculcating thrift, and we were all glad that a measure of national insurance should come, and we welcomed it, and every one of us would be sorry if the Bill were lost. It occurs to us all that there are a great many points in which it might be amended. I do not mean points of finance, with which, perhaps, this House ought not to meddle, but other points. As I read this Bill on Saturday and tried to understand it, it was, I am afraid, rather like an old lady making out a cross-country journey in Bradshaw; and it occurred to me that a woman living with a man not married was put in a better position than a woman living with a man in lawful wedlock. No doubt I was absolutely wrong and under a misunderstanding, but still, supposing it occurred that there was any foundation for that, why should we not try to amend it?<lb/>
Then, again, are we not to make any suggestion whatever to the Government by which the powers given under the Bill, if there is a possibility of their being tyrannically used, should be lessened? If any other point has been given to us as a suggestion with regard to the hospitals and societies, are we not to press that as an Amendment on the Government? I cannot think so. Then there is a question about these local health committees. I understand that the noble Viscount is going to change their names. If we think that those committees could be better constituted&#x2014;and I myself think there is no reason why the employer should not be represented on them&#x2014;may not we make these suggestions to the Government and have a certain time given us in which to make them? I am not pressing anything that would cause real trouble to the Government, but, after all, when people look at the House of Lords they will say, and I think it will not redound to the credit of this House, Because they could not do all they could to make this a good Bill, they did not do the little in their power in the time at their disposal with helpful
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0404"/>
<col>799</col>
suggestions so that this Bill should press less heavily upon the various members of the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02535"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend who sits by me (Earl Beau champ) had intended to reply upon the Bill and deal with the unemployment part rather more fully than I did, but the course which the debate has taken renders it hardly necessary at this hour, and I only rise to say a very few words. The course which the noble Marquess opposite has taken, I cannot doubt, is a wise one. Certainly he tried most judicially the propositions which were brought before him, and the sentence which he pronounced on the Referendum was very just and conclusive against the possibility of doing anything with that. Then, as the noble Marquess pointed out, for the rest you have to choose between, not a series of intermediate courses, but between two very widely different things. The speech of the right rev. Prelate has opened up great possibilities. The Government is not desirous of placing any obstacle in the way of the course he suggests. We are quite ready to listen to anything of the kind; but I did not gather from him that he confined himself to any one point in the Bill. It seemed to me there was a vast vista of amendment towards which he looked, and which would take up a very long time. As regards what was said by Lord Clifford of Chudleigh about hospitals, it will be found that there are pretty wide powers as regards hospitals in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

experience will work out. I agree with my noble friend that the hospitals play a most important part in this scheme, and in Germany things have so worked out that the insurance system is the life and soul of the scheme. Almost everybody coming for treatment goes to the hospitals. That may not turn out to be so here, but at least it is a thing to remember when predicting what will happen here. Then as regards the whole matter I will now ask your Lordships to give the Bill a Second Reading, and I will put down the Committee <i>pro forma</i> for to-morrow merely for getting the Bill reprinted with the Amendments substituting insurance committees for health committees.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE KING IN INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02546" align="center"><b>THE DURBAR ANNOUNCEMENT.</b></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02547"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is my duty on behalf of His Majesty's Ministers to lay before your Lordships, in an authentic form, the language which a few hours ago only His Majesty was graciously pleased to use in that vast and incomparably imposing assembly which had met to pay him their homage and allegiance at Delhi. His Majesty testified in words of moving depth and sincerity of feeling his sense of the sympathy&#x2014;and these are His Majesty's own words&#x2014;and affectionate good will which unite the Princes and peoples of India, whose representatives were then before him, with himself and the Queen Consort, who accompanied him. His Majesty then commanded his Governor-General to recite certain marks of his special favour and consideration, designed by him to commemorate the auspicious event of his Coronation some months ago, and, finally, he announced some new and far-reaching steps in Indian policy, which, on the advice of his Ministers, he had resolved to adopt. The keystone of this portion of the gracious speech is to be found in a paragraph which, perhaps, the House will allow me to read&#x2014;
<quote>"We are pleased to announce to our people that on the advice of our Ministers, tendered after consultation with our Governor-General in Council, we have decided upon the transfer of the seat of the government of India from Calcutta to the ancient capital of Delhi; and simultaneously, and as a consequence of that transfer, the creation at as early a date as possible of a Governorship for the Presidency of Bengal, of a new Lieutenant-Governorship in Council for Behar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa; and, finally, of a chief Commissionership of Assam, with such administrative changes as may by-and-bye be found necessary."</quote>
My Lords, no words of mine are needed, or even tolerable, in commending this im-
<col>802</col>
portant paragraph on the present occasion; but meanwhile I commend it to the attention and consideration of the Sovereign Parliament. Papers containing the language of His Majesty, the language of the Governor-General, and besides that the Despatch which the Governor-General addressed to the Secretary of State in August this year and the reply of the Secretary of State to the Governor-General are now ready and will be in the hands of your Lordships directly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02548"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I doubt whether this House has ever listened to a more important statement than that which has just fallen from the lips of the noble Viscount opposite. He has informed us of impending changes in the Government of India which, whether we consider their intrinsic magnitude, or whether we consider the circumstances in which they are proposed, cannot fail to mark an epoch in the annals of the Indian Empire. The noble Viscount did not say too much when he spoke of these changes as new and far-reaching, for far-reaching they certainly will be. These great changes have obviously been advised by His Majesty's Councillors with the intention of enabling His Majesty to signalise his visit to India by some conspicuous measure gratifying and acceptable to His Majesty's Indian subjects, and of such a kind as will enable them to look back in future years to the year of the King-Emperor's visit as a great landmark in the history of India. I can well understand that that should be the wish of His Majesty's Government, and I do not think anyone will be found to question the policy of thus commemorating the King-Emperor's visit by some great and beneficent measure. Our first impulse then, certainly is to give what encouragement we can to any proposals made with this admirable object. But the changes which the noble Viscount has described raise such grave issues that no consideration, I venture to think, would justify us in hurriedly passing a judgment upon them or in doing anything which might hereafter be regarded as depriving us of our right of freely criticising what is suggested.<lb/>
These changes involve much which can scarcely fail to provoke criticism. I gather that the points of importance are four in number. There is, in the first place, the proposal to transfer the seat of the government of India from Calcutta to the ancient
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0406"/>
<col>803</col>
capital of Delhi&#x2014;a proposal involving the uprooting of many traditions which, though not perhaps carrying us to a very remote past, are nevertheless deeply seated in the sentiment of a part of the Indian community. In the next place, there is the proposal to institute a new Lieutenant-Governorship for Behar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa, and the much more important proposal which accompanies it for the creation of a great Bengali Presidency, numbering some forty millions of people, under a Governor in Council, assisted, of course, by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. Those are the principal changes, and there is a less important change with regard to the Chief Commissionership of Assam which I only mention in passing. These proposals involve an abrupt reversal of the policy initiated by my noble friend behind me (Lord Curzon), accepted by his successor in the Viceroyalty, accepted by the late Government, and continued by the Government which is now in power.<lb/>
But, my Lords, what makes these proposals really of quite exceptional importance is the fact that they are to be connected with the personal intervention of the sovereign. That is a very serious matter indeed. These new departures, which I can only characterise as of the utmost gravity, will, unless I am mistaken, provoke in India every variety of feeling, ranging from great elation to great disappointment, and from the highest hopes to serious mortification. The policy of His Majesty's Government will certainly provoke criticism, but I venture to suggest to your Lordships that this is not the moment for attempting such criticism. We are within a very few days of the end of the Session. The time of the House, unless I am mistaken, is already fully occupied, and your Lordships would not have time to study sufficiently a subject which is extremely complex and difficult, even for those who have had some experience of Indian administration. Apart from that, I cannot help feeling that if we were to enter upon a critical examination of these matters it might be difficult to avoid a jarring note which none of us would like to strike at the present time.<lb/>
There is another consideration which leads me to the same conclusion. Nothing which this House can say or do can alter what has been announced by His Majesty
<col>804</col>
this morning. The word of the King-Emperor has been passed, and that word is irrevocable. For these reasons, my Lords, I venture to think that we should do well to defer for a time the discussion of these great events, but. beyond all doubt we shall ask for an opportunity of discussing it, and of discussing it with the utmost freedom. We shall be discussing events which, for better or for worse, cannot fail to render His Majesty's visit to India ever memorable in the history of the Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02549"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask your permission to make a very few remarks. It may be in your Lordships' remembrance that when the scheme of reform for India was presented to you by the noble Viscount who was then Secretary of State I ventured to suggest that there were certain aspects of the Indian question that were not satisfied by his otherwise noble scheme of reform. I particularly mentioned, and, indeed, I put down a Motion on the subject, that the proper way to deal with this question was to bring all the Bengali-speaking peoples under one governor, creating Behar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa into an independent governorship, and relegating Assam into a Chief Commissionership. I cannot say with what deep satisfaction I find that His Majesty the King has passed the Orders that he has passed to-day. I believe they are Orders which will create the utmost feeling of loyalty and satisfaction in India. They are the kind of Orders that were wanted to give the same significance to the occasion as attached to the Declaration bringing India under the control of the Crown. I believe that there may be, and probably will be, some factitious expressions of disappointment, but I consider that these Orders are the greatest that have ever been issued to secure loyalty to and the prosperity of the British Raj in India.</membercontribution></p>

the traditional and accepted policy of the Government of India, not merely, as my noble friend has said, during the past decade, but during the past century or more&#x2014;they bear in one respect, at any rate, as has been alluded to by the noble Lord who has just spoken, so strong a political flavour, and, above all, they are invested with so novel and unprecedented a character in being placed at a moment of great solemnity in the lips of the Sovereign, that I venture to say they demand the closest attention and the most minute scrutiny at the hands of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The noble Lord who has just spoken has given me an opportunity, did I wish to take it, of following him upon a delicate but also stormy field of controversy. With his views I am wholly in disagreement. I shall take an opportunity at an early date&#x2014;one having been denied me on a previous occasion because I was not present in the House when the noble Lord made the speech to which he has referred&#x2014;of meeting him in discussion on this matter. But for the moment I do not desire to strike any discordant note. The noble Marquess beside me has reminded your Lordships that we are in the expiring days of the session of Parliament, and an even graver consideration, in the effect that it must have On Our judgment, is that the King, who has made this Declaration, is still in India in pursuance of a tour with which we all sympathise, and which we desire shall be attended with circumstances of congratulation and success. In these circumstances, while reserving to myself all the rights that are inherent in every member of your Lordships' House, I concur, although not without some hesitation, in the advice that has been given by the noble Marquess. But, my Lords, I hope that, at the first favourable moment in the new session of Parliament your Lordships will consider it your duty, with all the information that will then be at your disposal and in the light of the reception that public opinion will have given to these great changes, to insist upon devoting the fullest examination and deliberation, without favour and without prejudice, to the momentous decision that has been announced this afternoon. My Lords, I will not trust myself at the present moment to say more on the subject lest I should contravene the principle in which I have expressed my acquiescence.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NATIONAL INSURANCE BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02551">House in Committee (according to Order): Bill <i>reported</i> without amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02552"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I mentioned yesterday that we proposed to take the Committee <i>pro forma</i> to-day, as there are certain verbal Amendments to the Bill which we desire to make. They are to substitute throughout the Bill, in accordance with the general wish, the expression "insurance committee" for "local health committee." It occurs in about ninety places, and it seemed convenient that the Bill should be reprinted with these words before your Lordships had it to consider in Committee. I now move that these Amendments be made.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NAVAL PRIZE BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02648" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02649">Order of the day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02650"><sup>*</sup><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in asking your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill it will not lie necessary for me to detain you at any great length, because the subject which we shall discuss this evening has already been discussed on no fewer than three occasions in an earlier part of the session. At the same time it is right that I should point out to your Lordships that the Bill which is before you to-day deals with other subjects than those comprised in the Declaration of London. Of the seven parts of this Bill, six, I think I may fairly say, are non-controversial, and probably the debate this evening will range round Part III, the part which, as I say, your Lordships have already discussed on a previous occasion. The remaining parts of the Bill deal with the consolidation and the amendment of the Naval Prize Act, 1864. Section 4 of the Judicature Act, 1891, and the Prize Courts Act of 1894. Part III provides for an appeal to an International Prize Court at the Hague. For a long time there has been felt a need for such a consolidation and amendment of the law, and it is of itself an important matter, non-controversial though it is. The alteration with regard to the Appeal Court is comparatively simple. At the present moment the appeal is to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; under this Bill the Judicial Committee is in matters of prize converted into the
<col>810</col>
Supreme Prize Court, for an obvious reason. Technically speaking, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is His Majesty sitting in Council, and it is quite rightly thought very desirable that no appeal should lie from His Majesty but that the appeal should rather be made to lie from a Supreme Court, which is a matter, perhaps, of technicality, but still of some importance.<lb/>
The important part round which I suppose most of the discussion will range this evening is Part III, which deals with the International Prize Court. This involves not only the Prize Court Convention but also the question of the Declaration of London. Let me briefly go over the history of the subject. During the Russo-Japanese war the Foreign Office was inundated with a number of complaints from British traders and British merchants, who complained of various acts which were done in the course of the war, but, still more, they complained of the want of certainty with regard to the state of the law. They said they wished to know what really was the law, what was contraband, what they might carry and what they might not, and as a consequence of this uncertainty I understand that the rates of insurance rose very high indeed. There was very little that the Foreign Office could do. There was no arbitration possible; and if the belligerents in that case or in any other case refuse arbitration, there is really very little that any Foreign Office can do in such circumstances. If the belligerent's Court. is the final Court and there is no possibility of appeal to arbitration or to any other Court, it is quite obvious that beyond the somewhat meagre resources of diplomacy there is very little that the Foreign Office can do. That was the position to which the present Secretary of State succeeded when he came into office, and he came to the conclusion that it was eminently desirable that, if possible, sonic means should be devised by which the decision of a belligerent's Court should be subject to an appeal in cases relating to neutrals; and when the Second Peace Conference at The Hague took place the British delegates and also the delegates from other nations went there with instructions to see if something could not be done in the matter.<lb/>
It was quite obvious that there were great difficulties to be met with. It was necessary, in order that a satisfactory
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0410"/>
<col>811</col>
solution should be found, that the Court should be a permanent Court, that it should be a representative Court, and also, if possible; that it should be a Court which met automatically on the outbreak of war and for which no special procedure was necessary in the way of setting it. up specially for that occasion. We think that by the suggestions made in the Bill those ends are practically attained. It is a representative Court, and Great Britain will have a representative in every case when that Court sits, and your Lordships will remember, I hope, during this discussion that it deals practically solely and only with the case of neutral ships and goods. It will not affect the operations of Great Britain as a belligerent on enemy ships but only the interests of neutral ships. Your Lordships will therefore see that our power at war remains undiminished, and I would venture to recall to your Lordships the statement made by my noble friend the Leader of the House on the occasion of the previous discussion which took place here, when he stated that in the opinion of the Board of Admiralty the results of this Convention upon us as belligerents would be practically small and negligible.<lb/>
We find in the newspapers a considerable amount of opposition to the Naval Prize Bill and to the Declaration of London so far as it affects it. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Charles Beresford, wrote a letter the other day to <i>The Times,</i> and I understand from the papers this morning that a remonstrance against this Bill has been sent to every member of your Lordships' House. I have, unfortunately, not seen a copy of it myself, but I believe it is very much on the same lines as the noble and gallant Lord's letter. This is what Lord Charles Beresford said in the course of his letter to <i>The Times</i> one day last week&#x2014;
<quote>"It is proposed to hand over those maritime rights which we have preserved for centuries to the decision of a foreign Court."</quote>
The suggestion which is made there, and the conclusion which most of us would derive from that sentence is that, under this Bill, we are transferring from British Courts to an International Court the control of the British Mercantile Marine, which is some eleven out of a total of 22 million tons throughout the whole of the world. What really and truly are the facts? When ships or rights are brought before British Courts they will in no case be British rights. They will not affect the
<col>812</col>
rights of any British owner. Your Lordships will see why in a moment. In a British Prize Court there will be the defendant and the claimant. The defendant, naturally, will be the British Government. Your Lordships will see in a moment that the only people who will bring cases against the British Government will be foreign owners. On the other hand, when there are cases which affect this country before an International Prize Court, it will be by way of appeal from a foreign prize court, not from a British; those interests can never be brought before a British Prize Court, and the two things are therefore mutually exclusive. British interests will be brought only before an International Prize Court, because it is impossible that they should be brought before a British Prize Court.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, let me say something about the rules which, under the Convention, the International Prize Court will apply. They first of all will apply Treaties so far as they are applicable; secondly, they will apply the rules of international law; and, thirdly, they will apply the principles of justice and equity. There are no Treaties on such subjects as contraband or blockade, but on the general question of prize law the Lord Chief Justice told us on a previous occasion that British prize law was practically the prize law of the world. It is only with diffidence that one ventures to differ from the noble and learned Lord on any legal question, but it is sufficient to point out that although British prize law figures largely in the text-books and although it has a very real importance in deciding what international prize law may be, other countries do not accept the same view of British prize law as we do ourselves. It is unfortunate it should be so, but there it is; and therefore it is impossible for us to expect, without a Convention or some negotiation, that we should get our rules and principles universally accepted throughout the world. So it came about that the Naval Conference was held in the years 1908 and 1909; this matter was thoroughly investigated and studied, and the plenipotentiaries at that Conference produced and signed the Declaration of London. Before the Conference assembled the noble and learned Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Desart, who had been connected with this matter for some time not only as King's Proctor but as Treasury Solicitor, went thoroughly into
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0411"/>
<col>813</col>
the matter together with the Secretary of Naval Intelligence, the Secretary of Imperial Defence, the Assistant-Secretary to the Admiralty, and two representatives of the Foreign Office who had had experience during the Russo-Japanese war and also of the negotiations during the Hague Conference. The duty of this Committee was to study the history and the practice of British prize law and to advise His Majesty's Government as to insisting, or not insisting, upon the views previously held by this country and as to the modifications which might be introduced to meet the various recommendations made by other countries. So the Declaration of London came into being, and was discussed in the House in the course of the present year. The discussion on that occasion, I think, turned principally upon two points. The first one was the omission from the Declaration of any prohibition of the right to convert merchantmen into warships upon the high seas. Nobody contradicts the right of any Power to convert such ships into warships in its own ports; the question was that of conversion on the high seas.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02653"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02654"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Earl agrees. That is the point I was trying to make. So far as conversion on the high seas is concerned, we found that foreign opinion did not agree with ours, and on that question it was impossible to come to a conclusion, and the matter, therefore, was left open for the future. In any case your Lordships would agree that if we were belligerents it would be the duty of the British Navy to hunt down those ships wherever they had been converted, whether on the high seas or in the ports of the enemy's country. As neutrals, the matter does not affect us so vitally. Foreign Powers have done it in the past and they probably will do it again. The point I wish to put is that, so far as it is done by foreign Powers, supposing we complain against the action of any such Power, we are forced to complain against them in their own Courts, and it is most unlikely that the Court of any
<col>814</col>
foreign Power would declare that such action was illegal. Therefore, at present, our only hope would be that such illegality would be declared by an International Prize Court, as it is very unlikely that it would be done by the Court of the country concerned.<lb/>
The other point round which discussion ranged on the last occasion is the question of conditional contraband. The noble Earl opposite, who is to move the rejection of this Bill, devoted a good part of his speech on that occasion to this subject. The argument has been used by the Secretary of State that, without the Declaration of London, Great Britain runs the risk that her enemy will claim to prevent the supplies of foodstuffs reaching this country by declaring them to be absolute contraband and therefore liable to capture, starvation being, in the opinion of some foreign countries, probably the best way of reducing this country to submission. Such action was taken in the case of France in her war with China, and Prince Bismarck declared at that time that it was a legitimate act of war. The noble Earl opposite, Lord Selborne, met this argument in the debate which was held in this House, to which I have already referred, by asserting that the diplomatic pressure of the United States of America would prevent any such action by an enemy Power, because he said, and quite rightly, that the United States are very largely interested in the supply of foodstuffs to this country and that no Power which had already entered into war with Great Britain would run the risk of a further war with, or of alienating the sympathies of, the United States, and that the existence of an International Prize Court would prevent, or at any rate, would reduce, the effect of such diplomatic pressure. I hope I have put his argument as he would have put it himself.<lb/>
We have an instance which will go some way to showing how far we may rely on the action of such a neutral Power. Very much the same thing happened in the course of the Russo-Japanese War when a British ship which was carrying a cargo of paraffin for lighting purposes, the oil itself belonging to a United States company, was captured by a Russian cruiser. At the outbreak of the war the Russian Government had issued a list of contraband, containing a word which covered both naphtha and crude
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0412"/>
<col>815</col>
petroleum; but on inquiry the British Ambassador was officially told by the Russian Government that that did not cover paraffin to be used for lighting purposes only. Notwithstanding that, the Russian Prize Court condemned the cargo as contraband and upheld the action of the Russian cruiser. According to the argument of the noble Earl, the United States of America should leave been able to bring so much diplomatic pressure to bear on the Russian Government that they would have compensated the merchants who had lost their cargo and prevented such action in the future. As a matter of fact, the United States Government contented themselves with protesting without any result at all. Therefore, although we have in this concrete case an example of what the noble Earl depends upon for preventing such an action in the future, we find that the United States did not succeed in preventing that treatment of contraband which the Declaration of London will at any rate succeed in effecting. There is this further point, that America is more interested in the export of petroleum than in that of wheat, and before very long it is not unlikely that the supply of wheat from the United States will be much less so far as the supply they send to us is concerned, and that it will eventually disappear altogether. I think that that instance is a not unfair commentary to make on the argument of the noble Earl opposite.<lb/>
The other discussion ranged round three special points&#x2014;the interpretation of the words "enemy," "base," and "fortified place." With regard to the interpretation of "enemy Government." I presume that the point is so well known to your Lordships that I need not go into it in detail. I would remind noble Lords opposite of the pledge given by my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the Imperial Conference, that this country would not proceed to the ratification of the Treaty unless the view of his Majesty's Government was upheld by the other Powers. If the noble Earl wishes the reference it is on page 107 of the Report of the Imperial Conference. Sir Edward Grey used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"It is one of the points which we shall make a condition of our ratification that that view should be accepted by the other Powers."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02655"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: Is that the view of the definition of base of supply?</membercontribution></p>
<col>816</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02656"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am coming to that in a moment; this is with regard to "enemy Government." I ought to say, in passing, that His Majesty's Government do not agree with the interpretations which have been put upon these three phrases by noble Lords who are opposed to the Declaration of London. We think that their interpretations are strained interpretations, but we are anxious to do what we can to meet noble Lords opposite; and I think, so far as "enemy Government" is concerned, the noble Earl will be satisfied with that explanation and guarantee of my right hon. friend.<lb/>
Then we come to the point as to "base" and "fortified place." The view of His Majesty's Government of the meaning of the phrase "base of supply," as used in Article 34, is that a place serves as a base of supply for the armed forces when the business of supplying those forces with what they require is organised and located there, and the stores required are collected and supplied to the forces from that place. A place cannot be regarded as serving as a base of supply for the armed forces merely because it is connected by rail or other means of communication with those forces and constitutes a source from which supplies might be obtained in case of need. Further, the interpretation which His Majesty's Government put upon the phrase "fortified place" in the same Article, dealing as it does with the presumptions arising from the place of destination and consignment of goods, is that a "fortified place" means a place surrounded by military works capable of withstanding a siege and in which the military and civilian population are so intermingled that goods intended for one could not be distinguished from the goods intended for the other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02657"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Earl suggest that those are the words of the Treaty?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02658"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: No; I am merely trying to state what the view of the Government is on the subject; and if the noble Earl will allow me, I hope to say something which will satisfy him later on. A port cannot be regarded as a fortified place in the view of the, Government merely because it has forts to protect it on the seaward side. The view of the noble Earl opposite as to the meaning of "base of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0413"/>
<col>817</col>
supply" is not shared by General Botha, although in the course of the earlier discussion the noble Earl referred specially to South Africa as being a place which could not be reached except through some such base. I would remind your Lordships that not only did General Botha himself repudiate that interpretation, but also the Imperial Conference which met this year at the Foreign Office expressed its approval of the Declaration of London. I hope that of the various points I have mentioned the "enemy Government" point, at any rate, is met by what was said by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the Imperial Conference.<lb/>
There remains, therefore, as matters of controversy and discussion the two points as to the meaning of "base" and "fortified place." in regard to that I am prepared on behalf of His Majesty's Government to give an undertaking, which I hope will be so far satisfactory to noble Lords opposite that they will be willing to give this Bill a Second Reading this evening. Part III of the Naval Prize Bill does not become operative until it is brought into force by an Order in Council. It is not the intention of His Majesty's Government to issue any such Order in Council until they are satisfied that the other Powers who have signed the Declaration attribute the same meaning to the words "base" and "fortified place" in Article 34 of the Declaration of London as His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Government are willing to undertake that no Order in Council will be. issued under this Act until it has been shown that there is such an agreed definition between His Majesty's Government and the other Powers concerned. When this is so the definition will be laid before Parliament, and no Order in Council will be issued under this Act until Parliament has had an opportunity of discussing the definition. His Majesty's Government are already in communication with foreign Powers on this subject, and they have no reason to believe that the answer which they will receive will be anything but satisfactory to themselves and, I hope I may add, to noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
This Bill, let me say in conclusion, is required even if the International Prize Court. Convention or the Declaration of London were not ratified. Part III is dependent on an Order in Council. With regard to that I have already, on behalf
<col>818</col>
of His Majesty's Government, given a pledge which I hope and believe will prove satisfactory to the noble Earl opposite. His Majesty's Government in this matter have acted with a full sense of their responsibility, having done their best to obtain the opinion of their expert advisers; and I venture to say if, under these circumstances, the Amendment of the noble Earl opposite is to be carried to-night, all those who are anxious that foreign affairs should be lifted out of the arena of mere Party politics and that there should be continuity in these matters would deeply regret such an action on the part of your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02659">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Beauchamp.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02660"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>, who had given notice, on the Motion for the Second. Reading, to move that the Bill be read 2<sup>a</sup> this day three months, said: My Lords, it is true, as the noble Earl stated at the commencement of his speech, that the main part of this Bill consists of the consolidation of the Prize Court law. In respect of that part of the Bill there is no controversy between the two sides of the House. It is only when we conic to the International Court of Appeal that is tacked on to this consolidating Bill that our difference with the Government commences. Speaking for myself, and, I believe, for those who act with me, I have no hostility to the establishment of an International Prize Court as such. If an International Prize Court can be formed which we think is competent to do the work entrusted to it. we should welcome its establishment, but it does not follow from that that we are prepared to accept any Court that is offered to us for this purpose.<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to observe that the noble Earl in moving the Second Reading of this Bill said nothing at all about the composition of the Prize Court which was to be formed under the Schedule. The very first point we have to consider is what is the Court to which it is proposed to entrust these great functions. The Court is to consist of no less than fifteen Judges. If we can be assured that all these fifteen Judges are competent jurists, even then I would say that they would be a bad Court, because the Court would be much too large. Who ever heard of a Court of Appeal of fifteen judges? I know of no precedent or parallel for such a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0414"/>
<col>819</col>
Court in the history of jurisprudence. Therefore I demur <i>in liminc</i> to this Court on account of its size. When I come to analyse the composition of this Court my demur turns to astonishment that the Government could ever have consented to such a Court. Of the fifteen Judges, eight are always to be representative of the eight Great Powers. Then there are Powers, such as Spain, Argentina, and Holland, who are not usually classed as great naval Powers but who are Powers of great importance in the world, whose co-operation in such an international task as this would always be welcome. Beyond that class of Power I will read a list of some of the Powers that are at one time or another to provide a Judge or a deputy Judge for this Court:&#x2014;Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela, San Domingo, Paraguay, Bolivia, Persia, Panama, Luxemburg, Costa Rica, Switzerland. Switzerland and Luxemburg are both inland countries. Other countries are Hayti, Servia, Siam, Honduras, Nicaragua, Montenegro, Cuba, Guatemala, Salvador, and Equador. This is to be the International Prize Court.<lb/>
I will not say anything disrespectful of those Powers, but it is not inconsistent with respect to say that the Powers whose names I have read out should not necessarily have a place in a great International Prize Court. The British Empire owns half the mercantile marine of the world, and yet it will have no greater representation on this Court than any one of the Powers I have mentioned. If you do form a Court of this kind, and I demur altogether to this system of forming it, I can see no justification for only giving the British Empire equal representation with one of the small Central and South American Republics. If in any important matter the representatives of the Great Powers were divided in opinion, is it not certain that every diplomatic influence that could be turned on the smaller Powers to secure their vote would be turned on and that this Court, instead of being a Court commanding universal assent as a Court of Justice, would become a mere centre of diplomatic intrigue. This is not really a Court at all; it is a sort of hybrid between a Parliament of the world and a Court of Justice, and it fails even more signally as a Court than it fails as a Parliament. It is to such a body as this that you are asked to allow an appeal from our own Privy Council. While, therefore, there
<col>820</col>
is to be an appeal from the Privy Council to this extraordinary body, which is neither a Court nor a Parliament, your Lordships will notice that there can be no corresponding appeal from the Supreme Court of the United States. The representatives of the United States discovered that by their Constitution it was not possible to carry an appeal from their Supreme Court to any new international tribunal, and therefore a protocol has been signed allowing cases in which American citizens are concerned to be initiated from the commencement in the International Court. That opens the door to this possible serious inconvenience, that cases might be carried both to the Supreme Court of the United States and also to the International Court, and you might get two perfectly conflicting sets of judgments.<lb/>
Now I ask your Lordships to compare this tribunal with the Hague tribunal. The Hague tribunal consists of only five Judges, and all of them have have been jurists of eminence. It is not too soon, I think, for us to admit, and admit with great satisfaction, that the Hague tribunal has been a great success. But why? Because it is a Court of Justice, because its members are limited in number, because they are all jurists of eminence, and therefore its decisions have commanded universal respect. There is no comparison between The Hague tribunal of five Judges, all of them jurists of eminence, and fifteen representatives of a collection of Powers, great, medium, and little, collected in the heterogeneous manner described and without any kind of assurance as to the qualifications of some of their members for the task entrusted to them. Sir Edward Grey in another place has not attempted to defend the composition of the Court. He said in effect:&#x2014;"You will get no other Court but this." It is incredible that the Powers of the civilised world who formed the Hague tribunal should be utterly unable to form a better International Prize Court of Appeal than this. I say with a full sense of responsibility that if this is the only International Prize Court that is possible then I would rather have no International Prize Court at all, and that without any reference to the code of international law which that Court might have to administer. I object to this Court on the threshold as not a fit and proper tribunal to try in the last
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0415"/>
<col>821</col>
instance cases affecting the mercantile marine of the British Empire.<lb/>
The law which this Court would administer is only an additional inducement why your Lordships should hesitate to confide such great interests to so inadequate a tribunal. In the House of Commons Mr. McKinnon Wood said that in naval matters international law was in a state of complete uncertainty and chaos. I think that is an exaggeration. I do not think there is any chaos or uncertainty about naval international law as decided either by our Courts or by the American Courts. The difficulty does not arise from chaos or the absence of any argued set of judgments, but from the fact that many foreign Powers will not accept the doctrines laid down by the American or British Courts; and therefore, as this proposed Court can only administer international law, they would have, as I think one of the members of the Convention in the first place cheerily remarked, to make the law very much in the rough. But His Majesty's Government felt that that was quite impossible and therefore they asked the Powers to send representatives to London to try and make a Code to which all nations should agree, and which would obviate the necessity of this Court making laws very much in the rough. It is, accordingly, the accepted principles of international law as defined in the Declaration of London which this Court would have to administer. But in addition, where the Declaration is silent, the Court would have to act according to its own ideas of justice, equity, or good conscience. Is it quite certain in the first place what document this Court would have to administer? There are the Articles of the Declaration of London, and there is also the Report of M. Renault upon those Articles, and nobody has yet told us with authority whether the Court would only have to look to the Articles or whether it would look to the Report as well as the Articles. I express no opinion on that abstruse question; I only notice that authorities and experts differ. Some say that the Report has equal authority with the Articles, and others deny that the Court could take the Report into consideration at all. There is a substantial difference between the two. In sonic cases our position would be improved if the Report was taken into consideration as well as the Articles, but certainly in
<col>822</col>
one case at least the position would, I think I shall be able to show, be made worse.<lb/>
And that brings me at once to the point which the noble Earl put his finger upon as one which disturbs those who take the view that I do of this matter&#x2014;the question of conditional contraband. Now, my Lords, if we want to estimate the true position of this matter let us try and put ourselves into the position of a foreign Power with whom we might unfortunately find ourselves at war. Rightly or wrongly it is surely manifest that that Power would consider the question of food supply as the British heel of Achilles. It would feel that it could do more to injure us by any serious interference with our food supply, even if that interference were only temporary, than it could by any other possible means. It would know that we alone of the Great Powers cannot supply ourselves with food. It would know that the store in hand is never large, and that really any interruption even for a few days of the stream of ships bringing food to this country might be productive to us of the most serious consequences. It would mean in the first place a rise in freights and in prices, and a shortage of food which might mean panic and riot. I think foreigners are largely inclined to over estimate the effect which such a pinch would have upon our population. I believe our people, if the war was one in which their heart was engaged, would not hamper their Government by riot or panic at a time of such emergency. That, however, does not alter the fact that the pinch on our population would be terrible. Therefore it is no wonder that a foreign Power should make its plaits almost exclusively at the beginning of a naval war with a view to creating a shortage in our food supply.<lb/>
At the present moment food is only contraband of war if destined for the armed forces of the enemy or for a port of naval or military equipment. Our Courts have decided what is meant by that. For instance Brest is, and Bordeaux is not, such a port, according to the decisions of our Courts; or, if you translate that into terms of English ports, I take it it would mean that Portsmouth is, and Southampton is not, such a port. By Article 34 of the Declaration of London a "fortified place belonging to the enemy or other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0416"/>
<col>823</col>
enemy" constitutes a destination which would make food contraband. But the Report says&#x2014;
<quote>"It may be a place used as a base of supply for the armed forces of the enemy."</quote>
Now, I am glad to see that there is no difference between the Government and the Opposition as to the interpretation which we should wish to see placed upon the words "a base of supply," but the question is what interpretation would be placed upon those words by the International Prize Court of Appeal. It is quite unnecessary after what has been said by Lord Beauchamp to repeat our arguments adduced to show how, with the instruction to do all he possibly could to interfere with the supply of food to the United Kingdom, the Admiral of an enemy's fleet would argue inevitably that every port in the United Kingdom was a base of supply. I will not develop that argument, but I will give, with the permission of your Lordships, an illustration showing that that view is not only likely to be held by the directors of naval operations in some Continental countries, but is actually expressed as their view in military textbooks at the present moment. On the question of what is a "base" now-a-days, General von Caemmerer says in his book, "The Development of Strategical Science"&#x2014;
<quote>"Railways have above all completely changed the term 'base' &#x2026; One does not base oneself any more on a distinct district which is specially prepared for that object, but upon the whole country, which, owing to the railways, has become one single magazine with separate storerooms."</quote>
Then, again, General Baron von der Goltz says in his book, "The Conduct of War"&#x2014;
<quote>"In Western Europe the dense network of railways allows of reinforcements and supplies being brought up in a few days from the most remote parts of a country. It even obviates the necessity of restricting the base to one district, the whole area of the State becoming the base."</quote>
That is the view held in military text-books in Germany, and therefore I think it proves that we were justified in directing the attention of His Majesty's Government and of the country to the immense importance of the interpretation of the words "base of supply."<lb/>
I was glad to hear what the noble Earl said as to the efforts of His Majesty's Government to elucidate this point, but I do not quite see how, without a fresh
<col>824</col>
supplementary Convention dealing with this point, any document merely expressing the view of an individual Power could bind an International Prize Court of Appeal which had to interpret the Articles of this Convention. Therefore, much as I welcome the belated step which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has taken, I do not think it is an adequate substitute for the clearer and more definite provisions which ought to have found their place in the Convention. The objection of the Opposition to the Bill does not arise solely from the doubts and fears which we entertain as to the Declaration of London, but because we believe that the Court of Appeal to be set up by the Bill is not a satisfactory Court for the adjustment of international questions. It is not a tribunal to which we should entrust the final definition of such terms as "enemy Government," "a base of supply," and "a fortified place," having regard to the great importance to the mercantile marine of this country of what the interpretation of those terms might be. It is an extraordinary fact that Article 34 is textually the Article proposed by one of the great Continental Powers. That in itself is not an argument against it; but I and those whom I have consulted complain that no discussion appears to have taken place as to the interpretation of the terms mentioned, and it does not seem to have occurred to the British representatives at the Conference how important was the meaning of the term "base of supply." I may be in error; if so no doubt I shall be corrected, but we cannot find any trace of a discussion upon this all-important point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02661"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Earl will forgive me for interrupting him. I may say that a great deal of the important discussion at the Conference took place <i>en commission</i> and was not reported and did not appear in the Minutes. Therefore it would not really be accurate to say that there was no discussion with regard to this point. I cannot honestly answer at the moment from recollection what amount of discussion there was with regard to this point, but I can say that very often there were extremely important discussions that took place <i>en commission</i> of which no notes were taken, and therefore did not appear in the Minutes of the full Conference at which notes were taken. I will not say positively that that is what happened in this particular case, but I know that was so on many occasions.</membercontribution></p>

<col>825</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02662"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Earl for what he has told us. I now pass from what the Declaration of London does say to what it does not say. Your Lordships must remember how very important is the silence of the Declaration of London, because where it is silent the International Court has to give its decisions very much in the rough according to its ideas of equity and justice. In regard to the conversion of merchant ships into cruisers on the high seas, I question whether it is true that no decision of the International Court of Appeal could affect us as belligerents. Our Navy would treat all merchantmen converted into cruisers on the high seas exactly as they would treat such vessels which had been converted in port or as the regular cruisers of the enemy; but surely if the International Prize Court gave a decision contrary to the British view, and held that conversion was legitimate, the number of merchantmen converted on the high seas into cruisers which British cruisers would have to meet would be much greater than if such a decision had never been given. As neutrals we should be directly affected by such a decision of the Court, and we might have forced upon us, by a Court whose competence I venture to question, the very doctrine to which His Majesty's Government, through their representatives at the Conference, refused to agree. Under Clause 28 British Courts throughout the Empire would be bound to enforce the decisions of the International Court in respect of a British neutral vessel captured by a merchantman converted on the high seas into a belligerent cruiser. Having enforced a decision of the International Court in such a case how could British Courts afterwards repudiate the very principles of law which we had ourselves enforced under this Bill? Sir Robert Finlay made that point in the House of Commons twice, and no answer was given to it, and I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that we run the risk of having this very doctrine which His Majesty's Government have been the first and most strenuous to repudiate forced upon us by the decisions of this International Prize Court of Appeal. The fact is that all the arguments which were so very eloquently put forward by the Secretary of State against setting up a Court at all without a Code, apply just as much now to the possibility of this Court settling the question of conversion without a code and according to its own ideas of justice and equity.<lb/>
<col>826</col>
By Article 49 a neutral ship, taken as a prize by a belligerent, could be destroyed by the captor if its preservation might compromise the success of the operations in which the belligerent was engaged. Article 40 declares that a neutral ship can be seized if half or more than half of the cargo is contraband. In the case of ships carrying wheat the cargo is almost wholly wheat, and if wheat is contraband the ship is liable to seizure. I ask the House to consider the cumulative effect of Articles 34, 40, and 49 and of the conversion of merchantmen on the high seas. Given that the great object of the enemy is to create a panic in the United Kingdom by cutting short our food supply, it is quite certain that the orders given to their naval officers would be to sacrifice every consideration to the success of this attempt. Therefore, is it not clear they might decide to treat any port of the United Kingdom as a base of supply and to take all neutral grain ships without exception and sink them? And this might be done, not only by regular cruisers of the enemy, by merchantmen converted into cruisers in the enemy's ports, but also by as many merchantmen as they had been able previously to arrange to be converted on the high seas. It has been said that all this might happen now. I quite agree, but the point I wish to make now is that the great question involved for us in each of these hypotheses, the principle involved, might be settled contrary to what we believe to be the true interpretation of international law in this Prize Court. by the casting vote, in the first year, of Colombia or Bolivia, in the second year of Uruguay or Costa Rica, and in the third year of Venezuela or Hayti. That is not a joke, but a perfectly true statement of what is possible under the Bill.<lb/>
It is true that now we run the risk of having foodstuffs declared absolute contraband of war by any nation with which we are unfortunately at war. But our position is that as belligerents we prefer that risk to the risk of the decision of such a Court as this in effect legalising the doctrine in the peculiar circumstances of our case. As neutrals we prefer to trust to diplomatic protest during the war to the decision of this Court after the war. We on this side of the House have had some experience in that matter both as belligerents and as neutrals. In the South African War, as belligerents, we had protests from neutral Powers. In the Russo-Japanese War we
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0418"/>
<col>827</col>
were neutrals and we entered protests to the belligerent. Powers. We know both the weakness of protest as looked at from the point of view of the neutral, and the strength of protest as looked at from the point of view of the belligerent, and I have no hesitation in saving that the Government has underrated all through this controversy the effect of the protest by a strong neutral on a belligerent. That is borne out by the Report of a Committee on the National Guarantee of War Risks for Shipping, presented in 1908. That Report, which was signed, among others, by that distinguished naval officer, Admiral Ottley, who was also a member of the Conference from which the Declaration of London emanated, says&#x2014;
<quote>"The danger of any material interruption to our supply of food and raw material is mitigated by the fact that such supplies would be shipped, in part at any rate, in neutral bottoms if British ships found the traffic too dangerous, end any belligerent with whom this country might be engaged in war might well hesitate to incur the hostility of a great Power, such as the United States of America, whose vessels were so engaged by treating such articles as contraband of war."</quote>
The point is that if the doctrine of unconditional contraband is now pushed to excess, a neutral Power could put great pressure on a belligerent Government which took that view. If the Declaration of London is ratified and an International Court of Appeal is set up, the belligerent would no longer pay any attention to the protests of a neutral, and would say. "We refer you to the International Prize Court." So that instead of the matter being settled during the war and the belligerent having to weigh the chances of incurring the hostility of the neutral, he would know that the decision, even if given against him, would be given after the war was over and after his particular action, if it has been successful, had had the full effect which he hoped from it. It is quite true that the British neutral shipowner now has to appeal to the Court of the belligerent&#x2014;I am quoting the words of Mr. McKinnon Wood&#x2014;and it is because that is so that the Opposition would be glad to see an International Court of Appeal which would carry with it the same confidence as the Hague Tribunal now does. It is because we cannot recognise the Court established by this Bill as anything more than a parody of such a Court that we ask the House not to read the Bill a second time. We have to consider our interests both as neutrals and as belligerents, and the real question is, Do the
<col>828</col>
Declaration of London, the Prize Court Convention, and this Bill taken together constitute an improvement or not on the present position?<lb/>
Sir Edward Grey said the other night that there had been a great deal of exaggeration in this matter. I quite agree, but I also maintain there has been a good deal of evasion and misplaced optimism on the part of the advocates of the Convention and the defenders of the Bill. Certain it is that public opinion of a very formidable kind exists in this country hostile to these agreements. Practically every Chamber of Commerce has pronounced against them, and practically the whole shipping world. Naval opinion, I admit, is divided. There are very strong and numerous opinions on the one side, and there are opinions on the other; but what is most significant and to me quite inexplicable is that from the beginning to the end of this lengthened controversy we have never once had an authoritative statement of the considered opinion of the Board of Admiralty.<lb/>
Your Lordships have seen, no doubt, a letter in to-day's <i>Times</i> from Admiral Sir Reginald Custance, a distinguished naval officer, of whose opinions I speak with great respect; but I would ask your Lordships to consider two of his expressions of opinion and to note a significant. omission from his letter. He says that the absence of any provision prohibiting the conversion of merchantmen at sea into ships of war alters nothing; that is true, but surely, if the International Prize Court of Appeal gave a decision in favour of the unlimited right of conversion, it would alter a great deal. Then he says that the safety of our food supply in war would depend on the strength and the use made of the Navy rather than on the presumed immunity of neutral shipping from capture. That is true, a thousand times true; if the Navy is not strong enough to protect our commerce, it does not matter for a moment how many neutral ships endeavour to bring food to this country, but it does not follow that we ought to regard with indifference the supply of food brought in neutral bottoms or without jealousy the provisions of this Declaration, which we believe will make the contribution of food in foreign bottoms more precarious than it is now. That letter, dealing with certain aspects of the Declaration of London and leaving no doubt upon our minds that Admiral Custance is in favour of it, says, however, not a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0419"/>
<col>829</col>
single word about this Bill or the International Prize Court of Appeal. If Admiral Custance had felt on equally strong ground about this Court on whose decisions so much will depend, it is not an extravagant supposition to think that he would have made a case for it in his letter, but he says not a word about it. I am prepared to differ from Admiral Custance about the Declaration of London. I know my opinion is of no value compared to his, but I can put against his opinion the opinion of other great naval experts. In conclusion, what I do say&#x2014;and in this proposition I ask your Lordships to concur&#x2014;is that, whether the Declaration of London be good or bad, this particular Court of Appeal is not one to which great naval and mercantile interests of this country should be committed; and it is because that is my profound conviction that I ask your Lordships to read this Bill a second time this day three months.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02664"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not intend to endeavour to answer the noble Earl or to take part at this stage of the debate, but I am constrained to do so because my noble friend Earl Beauchamp made a very plain and important suggestion which I should have thought that any statesman responsible not for a Department but for the Executive Government of Great Britain which has to deal with foreign nations and with diplomatic policy might have expected would have been taken some heed of. The noble Earl has apparently taken no heed of it. Let me point out what it is that we are really now doing. Here is a Bill most of which is not controversial, but which contains a third part which deals with the subject matter of an International Prize Court and incidentally with the Declaration of London. Let us see what the position is. It was the British Government, our Government&#x2014;for, after all, when we are dealing with our national concerns it is our Government, although it may not be agreeable to some members of the House&#x2014;who made the proposal and asked foreign nations to come and agree with us, in view of the uncertainty of naval prize law, in order to see if we could come to terms. We have come to terms, though I quite agree that what they are it is wholly for Parliament to consider. We have not
<col>830</col>
yet ratified them; the other nations are waiting to ratify them; and what we want here is a power to carry into effect one part of what was agreed to by means of the proposed legislation.<lb/>
How shall we stand before the other nations of the world if we are denied by this House the means of giving effect to what we have agreed to, not lightly but after great pains and inquiry and with the best expert advice we could command and the best naval advice, and after having submitted it to the Imperial Conference and having obtained the approval of the Imperial Conference? I do not say that that is a conclusive consideration. I do not deny that the matter should be sifted, but it is an important consideration. There was not a trace in the speech of the noble Earl that he was speaking in regard to the action of this House towards the Executive Government of the British nation which has come to an agreement with the other nations of the world upon this matter; there was not a trace that he had in his mind anything else than to throw out the Bill. There are others sitting on that Bench who, I know, will take a very different view, though I do not say that they will not agree with the course taken by the noble Earl. No one could have done more than the noble Earl did to set forth his views and objections, but after his clear and careful statement are your Lordships quite convinced that you understand this question sufficiently to be prepared to set yourselves against the Executive Government and say that we are to go to the other nations and tell them, "It is true we proposed a Conference, and that the whole Empire and the Imperial Conference have approved the suggestion, but the House of Lords so fully and thoroughly comprehends all the points that it is prepared to throw the Bill in the face of the Government and to ask them to make the best excuses they can to the assembled Powers that they have brought together, and to explain that they can do nothing owing to the action of the House of Lords"?<lb/>
I submit this to your Lordships and no more: ought you not to be certain that you thoroughly understand the precise point before you are prepared to throw out this Bill? You ought at least to wait until we get to Committee. This is only a Bill to set up a tribunal, and it is only incidentally that the Declaration of London comes in. This is not a matter
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0420"/>
<col>831</col>
of legislation merely as such. Legislation is one thing affecting the interests of this country, but this is necessary as an act of executive power for the ratification of a particular course. You will find differences of opinion in naval circles and at the Admiralty. They are divided into two camps with regard to this Bill. You have also the Chambers of Commerce. I do not wish to speak of them with any disrespect, but have they really considered it? You have had a raging, tearing propaganda about it in the <i>Daily Mail&#x2014;</i> a paper for which I have no aversion at all&#x2014;and other papers. Some of the gentlemen who have been conducting the campaign against this Bill are excellent but irresponsible men. Now, your Lordships are not irresponsible, and you have to consider whether you will accept this newspaper agitation, which people are asked to regard as <i>vox populi,</i> and, indeed, almost <i>vox Dei.</i><lb/>
The noble Earl said that this controversy began with a good many objections, which I think he admitted himself to be quite unreasonable. Every appeal to spurious facts has been made, but the objections now concentrated are few in number. The noble Earl says in substance that the decisions of the British Prize Court ought not to be appealable to a Court comprising fifteen persons and representative of practically all the nations of the world. I think that he even mentioned our old friend Costa Rica. He complained of the number of these Judges, and said that it was quite unprecedented in the history of jurisprudence. I am very sorry but he must really allow me to differ from him. I have seen, I think, fifteen Judges, I am not certain it was not sixteen, hearing the celebrated "Franconia" case to decide what was the limit of extra-territorial waters and the powers within territorial waters, and Lord Halsbury took a conspicuous part in the arguments. It is not, therefore, unprecedented in the history of jurisprudence. I remember once going to Paris and being taken into a Court where there was quite a crowd of Judges&#x2014;I am sure more than fifteen. That is not by any means uncommon abroad; but, though I think there may be wisdom in our prevalent habit in England, although it used not to be the case in Scotland, of having four or five Judges&#x2014;some of the greatest decisions in the history of the country have been come to by quite small tribunals&#x2014;that does not mean that there
<col>832</col>
may not be wisdom in numbers. Is that the class of objection that so grips the minds of your Lordships that you think it worth attending to in considering the course it is suggested you are to take? The noble Earl says that he does not mind going to the Hague Court because it consists of eminent jurists and experts; but he asks your Lordships to believe that this is to be composed of the riff-raff of the South American Republics possessing no knowledge or learning or anything else. Really, let us be serious. The Prize Court will always consist. of the representatives of the eight principal Powers. It is true that there is the right for the smaller Powers, including Uruguay and Paraguay, very occasionally to send a Judge or a Deputy Judge if they like. They must be of known proficiency in the matter of legal knowledge. Are we to be asked to throw all this away and to say that it means the riff-raff of South America? That is the sort of thing the noble Earl implies by his very grave proposal, and I say it is not fair to those nations who have agreed to this Convention.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02666"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I admit it, and, if necessary, I will withdraw it and apologise to the noble Earl if I have offended him. but I think it conveyed that idea, and was distinctly delineated by him, although he did not fill up the picture. That is, I think, what he wished to convey. This is a Court that all the nations have agreed to. They were serious. They felt, like most Executive Governments have felt, the grave inconvenience of uncertainty in regard to international law. These great statesmen who were consenting parties to this Convention, so derided by the noble Earl, meant business, and they did not think they were going to have a set of unpromising and uninstructed people to form this tribunal. The noble Earl said a thing which I think was perfectly true. He said he could imagine easily a better Court being formed. So could I. There are few Courts with which I have been connected which I could not, if I had the opportunity, better. But the noble Earl must remember that we did try. There was a proposal made that the Court should consist merely of representatives of the Great. Powers. Your
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0421"/>
<col>833</col>
Lordships can understand the angry clamour that arose among those Powers which were not recognised as great when a proposal of that kind was made. It came to this, that there was no other Court which could be obtained except this. What you have therefore to consider is whether this Court or the existing, system is the better. That is the first point on which you have to make up your minds. It is not a case of improving as you would like.<lb/>
The present system is that, whenever a nation is at war and captures enemy ships, the belligerent itself is the sole judge and the sole guide as to what is right and what is wrong. It has to decide the case itself, being an interested party. Our mercantile marine is to be brought before a belligerent Court, judging in its own case. For instance, the captures by Russia in the Russo-Japanese War gave a great deal of trouble to the Executive Government at the time. The decisions had to be taken by the Russian Courts. Were they satisfactory? Your Lordships know perfectly well that they were very unsatisfactory in some respects, and that in some cases we got no redress. That illustrates the value of the point of the noble Earl. He says, "Ah, we were not bound by the Russian Courts. We shall be bound by the new International Court." It is true. that we were not bound by the Russian Courts, technically. Were we in fact? There was the case of the "Knight Commander" and the "Oldhamia."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02667"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: If the "Knight Commander" had been sunk under Article 49, and had this Declaration of London been the law at the time, I do not think the owners would have got a penny of compensation. It is a doubtful question whether the owners of the "Oldhamia" would have obtained compensation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02668"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am coming to that. There was the case of the "Knight Commander" and there were some other ships in which no compensation was ever paid. You got nothing for the "Oldhamia," though we tried for six years. Technically you are not bound, but what is your method of redress? As the existing law is, the only method of redress, if the Courts of a Power which has captured your ship refuse to give you redress, is the stern arbitrament of war.
<col>834</col>
Of course, we are not going to war on account of the "Oldhamia" or any question of the kind. The effect is that technically you are not bound by the Prize Court of a particular belligerent nation, but practically you are, and that has been the difficulty which has been better illustrated by the Russo-Japanese war than in any other case. I say it is better to have an International Prize Court than to have the tribunal of a belligerent judging in its own case. At all events you have an appeal. The "Oldhamia" ease might have been taken from the Russian Court under this Bill to the International Prize Court, whereas now there is no appeal of any sort or kind.<lb/>
Supposing Great Britain is at war, the opponents of the Bill say that it deprives us of the support which we would otherwise get from a powerful neutral, such as the United States, if an unscrupulous enemy tried to treat all food stuffs as contraband and so starve us. That is the position taken up by the noble Earl, to which lie attaches great importance. Supposing, for example, we were at war with a Continental Power. The argument of the noble Earl is that as the law now is, the United States would protest if ships carrying food were stopped by the belligerent, but that, if an International Prize Court is set up, the United States would not protest because they would consider themselves bound by the decision of the Court. That argument. really is not sound, because it never is worth the while of a neutral to go to war in respect of a question of that kind. We all know perfectly well that the sinking of a ship is a very small matter to a neutral, and they are not going to engage themselves in a great war on a small point of that kind.<lb/>
You may depend upon it that, in regard to the food supplies of this country&#x2014;and I have never failed to be one of those who recognised it&#x2014;your protection is your Navy, and you have got no other protection, and no kind of Treaty or obligation will suffice to be a substitute for the strength of the Navy. This argument of the noble Earl is one which ignores that great point, without the remembrance of which we can never fairly discuss these maritime questions. So much for the Court. On the balance of gain and loss I venture to think that your Lordships will judge that the gain is ours. At all events, I would ask you very seriously to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0422"/>
<col>835</col>
consider before you take the very strong step of throwing out this Bill and leaving us to face the nations of the world with whom we have entered into negotiations.<lb/>
The next objection is that, by the Declaration of London, States are not prohibited from converting merchant ships into fighting ships on the high seas. Our position at the Convention was that you cannot under any circumstances convert on the high seas, but all the other Powers&#x2014;Japan, I think, was the only Great Power that supported us&#x2014;said, "We will not accept that," and they never have accepted it. Every one who is familiar with this subject knows that we are against the world alone, or practically alone, in upholding this view. The other Powers that objected to our view included France, Russia, Germany, and Austria. I cannot enter into a discussion of fact. I can only state that it is my distinct view of the subject that the other nations will not accept it, certainly those I have quoted will not, and I say that Japan was the only Great Power that distinctly supported us. The United States of America took an attitude which was neither one way nor the other. That was our view. If we had been able to prevail we should have prevailed. But we could not. and therefore a compromise was adopted. Not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the law was not altered, and each nation is entitled to apply, as it pleases, its own law.<lb/>
It is surely rather difficult to complain that we have not secured consent when other nations were not willing to consent. We have not altered the law in this respect, but it is said by those who object that, before you set up an International Prize Court, you could, if you were a neutral, give notice to a belligerent that you would not allow your ships to be captured by any vessel which had been converted on the high seas. And it is said that now after this international Prize Court is set up you could not practically say that because you are bound to leave it to the Prize Court. I think that is a perfectly true observation, and I agree with the noble Earl that it would be difficult for us, when the International Prize Court had been set up, to give notice beforehand, we being neutral, that we would not allow our ships to be captured by vessels which had been converted on the high seas. It means that if your ships are captured on the charge of
<col>836</col>
carrying contraband or of breaking blockade by a vessel which has been converted on the high seas, you will no longer be able to make that a <i>casus belli</i> Is not that really what it comes to? There are very few ships that are in the least likely to be carrying contraband or breaking blockade. It is a lawful but not a very meritorious service. The difficulty cannot arise unless one of that class of ships happens to be captured by a ship of war which has been converted on the high seas. I agree that by leaving this and other questions to the International Prize Court you are precluded from making it a <i>casus belli</i> That is the total amount of your loss in this respect. On the other hand, if you are at war you get a great deal because the Court does not affect any belligerent, and has no authority except between neutral and belligerent.<lb/>
The next complaint is this. It is complained that under this Convention a belligerent may destroy a neutral prize before condemnation by a Prize Court. Our contention before the Powers was that you could not do that under any circumstances. I think all the Powers maintained that they could destroy a prize at sea and that the Prize Court could afterwards decide whether you ought to pay compensation or not. There again our opinion was directly opposed to the opinion of nearly all the nations. The result was a compromise to this effect, that you may destroy if military necessity requires, but if military necessity does not require it, you must pay compensation, whether or not the ship destroyed was a lawful prize. We have gained by that because we have limited the powers which practically all the other nations of the world claimed to use in an unfettered sense. We have succeeded in obtaining a limitation of that, and that is good for us in every way. As belligerents we obtain a right like other nations to sink prizes if military necessity requires it, and I am told there are many sailors who think it might be necessary for us to use that power in some cases. If we could prevent other nations from sinking without condemnation by a Prize Court, it might be better, but I believe naval opinion differs on that subject also, and since we have practically the whole world against us on that, are we not right to come to a compromise such as I have indicated?<lb/>
I now come to the last point which the noble Earl made a matter of complaint.
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0423"/>
<col>837</col>
He said that under the language of Article 34 of the Declaration of London our enemies might seriously interfere with the food supply of this country by treating every port in the United Kingdom as a "base," and so stopping neutral ships laden with food coming to the United Kingdom. We say that the word "base" and the ancillary word "fortified place" cannot mean what the noble Earl is afraid of. We also say that 90 per cent. of our food comes in British ships, so that the danger if it be a danger only affects 10 per cent. of our food supply. At the same time we recognise that it is a thing on which the public opinion is sensitive, and it is the only thing that has any real substance. And this is the offer which was made by my noble friend Lord Beauchamp, and, I am afraid, practically ignored by the noble Earl. Let us see how far it goes. It says&#x2014;
<quote>"Part III of the Naval Prize Bill does not become operative until brought into force by all Order in Council. It is not the intention of His Majesty's Government to issue any such Order in Council until they are satisfied that the other Powers who have signed the Declaration attribute the same meaning to the words 'base' and 'fortified place' in Article 34 of the Declaration of London as His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Government are willing to undertake that no Order in. Council will be issued under this Act until it has been shown that there is such an agreed definition between His Majesty's Government and the other Powers concerned. When this is so, the definition \yin be laid before Parliament, and no Order Council will be issued under this Act until Parliament has had an opportunity of discussing the definition."</quote>
I want respectfully to put again to your Lordships the considerations with which I commenced. This House has the power of throwing out this Bill. It has the power of placing us in a position which your Lordships can imagine with regard to foreign nations, in the face of the advice of the Executive Government, of those gentlemen who were commissioned by the Government without; ally pretence of Party preference, sent out to negotiate and discuss this subject; in the face of the other States comprising the British Empire on the Imperial Conference with the exception of Australia, which adopted a neutral attitude, and upon the ground mainly of the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, supported by a newspaper agitation and the adverse criticism of some Chambers of Commerce. That is exactly the situation, and so anxious are we, not from a Party view&#x2014;and I am sure the same could be said of the other side, for there is no Party interest in this business&#x2014;so
<col>838</col>
anxious are we that this which we believe to be a valuable and useful Bill should be promoted and passed into law, that we have made the offer which I have read out to your Lordships. I venture to think that this House, with its sense of responsibility, will think twice, will think thrice, before they will do what they are asked to do by the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02669"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quite agree that technically we are engaged simply upon a discussion of a Bill which is to set up a new tribunal, but I think it quite impossible adequately to consider its importance and relevancy without some allusion to that which I agree, in strictness, is quite beside the particular matter which your Lordships have to decide. I think the matter lies within a very small compass, and I certainly do not propose to do what I think it would be inadvisable indeed to do&#x2014;namely, to go over the whole question of the Declaration of London. I think it practically comes to this, whether we are going to alter international law, and herein I must ask the noble and learned Earl a question. He adheres to the opinion which I understood he gave to me on a former occasion, that M. Renault's views are authoritative. Upon that a greal deal of this question turns. If the views of M. Renault and the Code which he makes up out of the Declaration of London are in truth authoritative and the tribunal to be erected is to be bound by them&#x2014;I understood that was the noble and learned Earl's admission to me on a former occasion&#x2014;if he adheres to that opinion, then I cannot. help saying that it appears to me that this Bill gives us the only opportunity which we can have of authoritatively determining whether that part of the Declaration of London is to be binding or not. The Treaty-making power is in the hands of His Majesty, of course advised by his Ministers, and in those circumstances all we can do is to prevent the making of a new law which is not within the Sovereign's prerogative, and which we have the power of dealing with. And if, in truth, what we see in this Bill is something injurious to this country, we have the right, and I venture to say the duty, to insist upon our right to prevent that injury being done&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02670"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble and learned Earl allow me to answer a question he put just now"? I ought to

have mentioned it before in regard to the General Report. This is what happened at the Imperial Conference [page 107]&#x2014;
<quote>Mr. Mallon: Sir Edward, perhaps this would be the point to put in a question: What do you regard as the exact legal force of the General Report?</quote>
<quote>Sir Edward Grey: The "General Report" is the Report of the Conference, and our view is that it was accepted and became part of the Conventional arrangement, in the sense of being an authoritative interpretation of the Declaration of London; that is one of the points which we shall make a condition of our ratification, that that view should be accepted by the other Powers.</quote>
That is exactly what I think I said in answer to the noble and learned Earl on the last occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02671"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I rather thought that was the answer which the noble and learned Earl would give. But then we are dealing with that particular document&#x2014;I hesitate to describe it by any particular name&#x2014;and that document lays down as one of its provisions that the Court shall determine the law if in their view the law has not been already determined. It also provides that where they think it proper to do so they shall lay down their own law, and I must say that it is described very candidly what their view of that is. Their view of what is right, is to be their view of what is justice and equity. You are erecting a new tribunal and giving it no Code; but you give it absolute power to determine what is right. That sweeps aside 200 years of decisions and says that this new Court shall determine. I protest against any such thing being done. It was said that Gustavus Adolphus had his treaties of peace and war under his pillow; he carried them about with him. But, at all events, without going to that extreme limit, here is a Court that has given satisfaction to a great degree in an enormous amount of litigation, established among ourselves, with a reputation. I need not mention many names, but Sir William Scott, and in more modern times Dr. Lushington and Sir Robert Phillimore and a great many very learned persons, have established, gradually established, a system and a Code of international law which has commanded respect in every country in the world.<lb/>
Now for the first time that I have heard of, instead of looking at what is actually agreed to in the Code, looking at the actual words and the different Articles of the Treaty itself, we are to look to this which
<col>840</col>
has been agreed upon by this somewhat extraordinary Convention, and your Lordships are to be guided by that in determining whether or not you will erect this new tribunal. If there is one thing which renders administration of law more difficult than it should be it is the question of there being an exact statement of what. the law is. From time to time we are constantly endeavouring to ascertain what is meant by certain words. But if, besides that, you are going by what the secretary has drawn up&#x2014;I do not know what M. Renault. is by profession, but he has drawn up this Report which is to be the authoritative explanation of what the Code means&#x2014;I confess it seems to me sufficient to condemn this Bill. I certainly never would agree to any such tribunal unless I had absolute and perfect confidence in it; and seine of these questions, which are, by the admission of the noble Earl himself, most important questions, have been left open questions to be determined afterwards by this new Court.<lb/>
I do not wish to go through them all, but take this question of the conversion of merchantmen. I think the noble Earl has under-rated this, because what it practically means is the re-introduction of privateering. They might very readily be turned into war vessels. A good many ships of the mercantile marine in these days are built in such a form that without much difficulty they could be turned into ships of war. They might, at some time or other, when at sea, without any notice at all, be turned into war ships and then when it was convenient, revert to merchant ships. If that would not give opportunity to privateering, I do not know what would. I think the noble Earl is a little mistaken about the agreement of the different Powers in that matter. I understand that the decision was seven to three; but what objection was there to determine the matter one way or the other? I think it so important that I would rather have surrendered the Treaty than that the matter should be left where it is. Again, why was not the definition of "base" determined then? Why did not those who had the responsibility of agreeing to this Treaty say, "When you speak of a base, let us know what is meant. Let it be defined." Instead of agreeing or disagreeing at the time when there was an opportunity, we have, as my noble friend says, this offer.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02675"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Very good, then. I cannot understand the noble Earl when he uses such a phrase as "Our offer." What offer? Is it an offer to the majority of this House, or is it not? And if it is an offer may I ask, Has any precedent, for any such procedure ever happened in this House? I venture to think not. I do not desire to discuss the Declaration of London. We discussed it at some length before. But what I would like to say about it, speaking generally, is this. I agree entirely with what the noble Earl said about our being dependent upon the strength of our Navy, and every one knows that the great power of this country is in its Navy. But I cannot help saying that the Declaration of London appears to have been conceived in the spirit of increasing the powers of the nations with large Armies and decreasing the powers of those who are in a great measure dependent upon their Navy. The noble Earl threatens us, as it were, with the displeasure, of those Powers whom we invited to come to agree with us and who have agreed with us to some extent, although they have left these open questions and not agreed with us entirely. We are told that if we reject what has ultimately been done, we expose ourselves to a great responsibility. I do not want to use the language, of braggadocio, but I think we are entitled to have our own view on this subject and I hope we will
<col>842</col>
stick to it and not be swayed by the consideration that the other countries who do not agree with us may be displeased if we do not agree entirely with them. For one thing, as I pointed out, we have not a defined Code which this new Court is to observe. It is given absolute and unlimited powers such as I believe no Court ought to possess; and in these circumstances I regard this as one of the most | mischievous and reckless proposals I have I ever seen put before your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02676"><member>LORD MAC DONNKLL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene in this debate with great reluctance, but as a member of your Lordships' House who has endeavoured to make himself master, so far as he could, of the intricacies of this discussion I thought that perhaps it might interest your Lordships to hear the results at which I have arrived. After reading the Papers with which we have been flooded, I came to the conclusion that the subject might be most properly considered from two points of view: the case of this country being a belligerent; and the case of this country being a neutral. In the former case, when Great Britain is a belligerent, it is admitted on all sides that the Bill has no application. It will in no degree fetter or limit the freedom of action of this country, consequently. I may put that aspect of the case out of consideration. In the case where Great Britain is a neutral and her ships suffer loss, Great Britain has at present no remedy except that which she can seek in the enemy's Prize Court. It seems to me to be obvious, therefore, that the provision of an independent. International Court of Appeal of this description must necessarily be of some use. Whatever the constitution of the Court, it gives to the applicant for redress some chance, of obtaining it. He has an appeal from the Court of the enemy's country, and I consequently he may succeed in his appeal. From that point of view it seems to me that the International Court is a clear gain to this country.<lb/>
On the other hand, take the case of Great Britain being a belligerent and seizing neutral property. The neutral owner will have, in the first instance, his remedy in the Prize Courts of Great Britain, and, as the noble and learned Earl has said, these Prize Courts are so excellent and have established such a
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0426"/>
<col>843</col>
reputation throughout the world for fairness and justice that it may be hoped that the applicant will go no further, and that he will obtain in those Courts all the assistance necessary. But assume that he has not the same confidence in the English Prize Courts that we have, it will surely be of great advantage to him to have an appeal to this independent tribunal. And I can see no reason why Great Britain should refuse him that appeal, unless it be the object of Great Britain to bring pressure to bear upon neutral States in order to bring about the cessation of the war. These points of view occur to me as justifying the establishment of this International Court, and I must say that from all I have heard to-night I see no reason for changing the independent conclusion to which I came.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02677"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having brought forward a Motion on this subject in your Lordships' House on March 8 last, I hope I may be permitted to make one or two remarks on the subject, although it is very far from my intention to go at any length into the question of the Declaration of London, which has been fully and amply discussed. The noble Earl who moved the Second Reading of this Bill remarked that the whole of the criticism would be directed to Part III of the Bill, which sets up this International Prize Court, but there is another matter to which I would like to call the attention of the Lord Chancellor for one moment. It is on a Constitutional point. Clause 30 in Part IV of the Bill seems to me to infringe the Prerogative of the Crown. I am not a lawyer, but I believe it is absolutely admitted by all lawyers that prize inures to the Crown. Now to my mind Clause 30 does most decidedly interfere with the Prerogative of the Crown in the matter of prize, and I should like to ask the Lord Chancellor whether that is the case. It has before now only been found out at the last moment on the Third Reading of a Bill that the Prerogative of the Crown has been infringed. This has occurred several times in the House of Commons. On one occasion, in April of 1852, Mr. Speaker, on the Third Reading of a Bill, declined to put the Question, and the proceedings were declared null and void. In the year 1866 the Speaker refused to put the Question on another Bill, on the ground that the House could not interfere with the Prerogative of the Crown. A similar
<col>844</col>
thing has also happened in your Lordships' House. There Was a Bill connected with the diocese of St. Asaph and Bangor. The Royal Prerogative was affected by that Bill, and what happened? The Lord Chancellor at that time desired the instructions of the House, a Committee was appointed, and the Bill was withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02678"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I certainly never heard of this point before. I am not at all sure that private property belonging to a British subject would inure to the Crown. But I will look into it. The consent of the Crown can be given at any stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02679"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: The Lord Chancellor says that the consent of the Crown can be given at any stage, but I should like to point out that the Crown, in person, can only place the Prerogative of the Crown at the disposal of Parliament. The Crown, as far as we are concerned, is now in Commission.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02680"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Certainly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02681"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: Whether the Prerogative of the Crown can be placed at the disposal of Parliament by wireless telegraphy I do not know, but my point is this. Suppose, for instance the "Olympic" or the "Lusitania," has been captured by a foreign Power and recaptured by British forces. Hitherto, the Crown would dispose of the Prize money, but that power is taken away by Clause 30 of the Bill, and that is the point on which I should like the opinion of the Lord Chancellor. However this may be, what we are considering at the present time is whether the Court that is proposed to be set up is a good Court, and whether the rules, as far as they are laid down, which it is going to be governed by are good or bad rules. I have no hesitation in saying that in my judgment&#x2014;which docs not go for much, but I have spent a year in considering the various points raised both by the Declaration of London and by this Bill&#x2014;I believe the Court to be a thoroughly bad one, and the rules to govern this Court to be if possible, worse. The Court which is going to be raised to revise our Prize Court decisions and those of the King in Council is to be composed of a motley array of various States, forty-five in number. I believe it is absolutely
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0427"/>
<col>845</col>
impossible to conceive a more unsuitable Court than that to act as a Court of Law, revising the decisions of Courts which have been given, after due consideration, in various countries. It is really a Parliament of States selected, as far as I can see, quite haphazard, and on no fixed principle of any sort or kind. As a matter of fact, the United States refused to be bound by this Court. They have absolutely declined, as far as I understand, to have the decisions of their Prize Courts and of their Prize Courts of Appeal revised by this Court. They have taken power, I admit, not to have the decisions of their Prize Courts revised by this international opera comque Court, but to find other means of enforcing their decrees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02682"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble Lord is the last man to desire to make a false point, and I can assure him that the difficulty was not raised by the United States representatives till the last days of the Conference. It was only disclosed just a few-days before, the conclusion of the Conference&#x2014;it had not been raised before&#x2014;that under the Constitution of America, which could not be altered without very great difficulties, it was not possible that there could be any appeal against a decision of a Supreme Court. There was no unwillingness to submit to the International Prize Court; they said, "We must try to devise some scheme by which we can come before the Prize Court." It was not that they objected, but it was found to be Constitutionally impossible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02683"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: The fact is, it is contrary to the Constitution of the United States to have their Prize Court decisions revised by this International Court, and I only wish it was the case with us at the present time. It is rather curious that the United States Prize Court decisions, which are founded upon English Common Law, should be impossible to be reversed and that they should stick to them, while we should have to submit our decisions to the consideration of this very composite body, with its very curious and very nebulous | rules. The composition of this Court has already been brought before your Lordships' House this evening. I have looked up some of the records of the States who are to revise our Prize Court decisions, which have been the admiration of the world for two hundred years. No fewer than seven of these States are at present unable to meet their creditors, and I have also looked up one other State in the "Encyclop&#x00E6;dia
<col>846</col>
Britannica." I have a sneaking regard for this State. But I should like, to bring before the House some conception of this supreme Court and the jurisdiction which is going to revise the decisions of the English Prize Courts. The State to which I allude is the respectable but not very large Republic of Hayti. I find that it consists of just about twice the area which used to be in the jurisdiction of the Thames Conservancy with regard to the purification of water. It has an Array of 7,000 men and its Navy has gone to the bottom. I believe it consisted of only one gun boat, but that, unfortunately, met with a mishap two or three months ago. According to the Encyclop&#x00E6;dia [Vol. 12, p. 825], corruption is spread through every portion and branch of the Government; Justice is venal, and the police are brutal and inefficient; the inhabitants appear to be kindly, but ignorant and lazy, and have a passion for weird African dances which they perform, to the accompaniment of a tom-tom. I have not a word to say against this State, because I believe it is a most enjoyable place to stay in, but it would have the power of appointing a Deputy Judge to this International Court, and this Deputy Judge would, in certain circumstances, have an equal voting power with us, who possess 50 per cent, of the sea traffic of the world. Hayti may under certain conditions, in the third year, replace, as far as I understand, Venezuela, and when they replace Venezuela the gentleman appointed by Hayti will have equal power with us. He will deliberate in secret; no one will know how ho votes, and he may, in some important maritime question, be able to turn the scale against this country. Though I have nothing to say against Hayti, I must say that if a Republic of this character has the, power to appoint a Judge to this Supreme Court, surely there are other States of a less corybantic nature who should have an equal power of appointing a Judge. For instance there are our Dominions, Australasia, Canada and South Africa, who have not one single member, though they have one-sixth of the sea trade of the world.<lb/>
There is another rather important question with regard to the Court. The language of the Court is not yet determined. No one has the smallest conception what it will be. The Court has power to appoint its own language. The Court, as constituted, has not yet had its language defined, except that there is one provision which says that
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0428"/>
<col>847</col>
the language of the Court in first instance may be used. Take a case before Japan. Supposing a case came up first of all in the Japanese Court, you would have Japanese as the allowed language before the International Prize Court, and I suppose, if you allow the other party to use his own language, you may have Turkish. Then also the Court is allowed to speak in its own language, which may be French, or Dutch, or anything. I venture to point out these questions, because they are too large to be left open. What would happen to a private litigant who went before this Court? First of all he has not the smallest conception of the language he has to plead in. This is a Court of Appeal; he may have been through two other Courts before, and he would find it very expensive. If he is in Russia he would have to go through three Courts, and then lie would come to this Court, in an unknown language, in which he has to instruct counsel, and even then the utmost he can get is the bare value of what he has lost. There will be no compensation, and a great many deductions are to be made from what he might get, including possibly the cost of a commission.<lb/>
Then, the powers of the Court are also very strongly objected to. The powers of this Court are absolutely unrestricted M. Renault most carefully says that this Court is to make the law. He says so in this Report, which we now know to be absolutely equally binding with the Declaration of London itself. This, it seems to me, instead of producing order out of chaos, makes the whole, business absolutely uncertain, because no one can know what decision is likely to be arrived at. As to the effect of the Court's decision, we are bound to carry it out according to Clause 28, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"The High Court and every Prize Court in a British possession shall enforce within its jurisdiction all orders and decrees of the International Prize Court in appeals and cases transferred to the Court under this part of this Act."</quote>
Then we have also been told by the advocates of the Bill that although we may suffer on other points, at all events, on blockade, we gain on the whole, and the argument has always been that because we gain on blockade therefore we were to sacrifice the whole of our food stuffs coming to this country which may be carried here in neutral vessels.<lb/>
But with regard to blockade, I must say I strongly dispute that point. Sir Edward
<col>848</col>
Fry, our head Commissioner there, has admitted that the rights of England as a belligerent suffer under blockade. Perhaps it is unnecessary to quote the exact passage, which I have here, but the laws of blockade seem to be the most extraordinary laws ever invented. Supposing you are blockading a port. You have a number of ships told off to blockade it, and a sort of undefined blockade area is established. In this area, you may catch, if you can, a ship that is breaking blockade. Of course, a ship that is doing that is either succouring the enemy or carrying arms and ammunition against the lives of your own people. But it is only in this area that you can catch this vessel. If she gets out of this area or zone you are not allowed to interfere with her, and the amusing thing is that only one of these ships told off for blockade duty is allowed to catch her at all. It would be useless to send a wireless message to one of your cruisers to catch this vessel, because directly she gets out of this area you are bound to let her go, and the cruiser in question not being one of the blockading force is not allowed to act. It is just as if you live in Belgrave-square, and some one commits a burglary in your house there, and you have a policeman whose sphere of operations is Belgrave-square. According to these rules it would be only the policeman in Belgrave-square who could catch the burglar, and only in Belgrave-square. If the burglar gets outside the square that policeman cannot touch him, neither would an officer on another beat be allowed to touch him. I will refer briefly to what has been said by the Lord Chancellor with regard to 31. Renault's Report and the offer which has been made by the Government&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02684"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: That is the General Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02685"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My own opinion with regard to these Articles is that they certainly want retranslating. The translation is very bad, and in many cases does not convey the meaning as it is in French, and the French text is binding. Besides that they want to be altogether redrafted. If this House or the other House of Parliament agreed to an important Treaty like this with the Articles so ill-defined, it would certainly not conduce to justice in the future. Now, 31. Renault has a long report on Article 33, which has already been alluded to, with regard to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0429"/>
<col>849</col>
foodstuffs; this requires a great deal more than merely a new definition of "port of supply." M. Renault speaks of port of supply as any port which may supply food to the Army, but he goes a great deal beyond that. What he says in this Report-is that "the State is one," and therefore if you supply food to a civil department, that civil department could send it on to the army department and therefore the food would be contraband. The Lord Chancellor shakes his head, but I think I am accurate. Monsieur Renault says&#x2014;
<quote>"The State is one although it necessarily arts through different departments. If a civil department, may freely receive foodstuffs or money "&#x2014;</quote>
That is not the question of a port, which the Government is going to define&#x2014;
<quote>"that department is not the only gainer, but the entire State, including its military administration, gains also, since the general resources of the State are thereby increased. Further, the receipts of the civil department may be considered of greater use to the military administration and directly assigned to the latter. Money or foodstuffs really destined for a civil department may thus come to be used directly for the needs of the army."</quote>
There is no question of a port here. This is his explanation of whether you may send food or not. You may not consign food to a civil department because, forsooth they may turn it over to the war department, and therefore, as he says, the whole State might gain. But that is the position in England at present. We have no neutral ports. Directly you come to a question of ports under the Declaration of London, why every ounce of food coming to this country in neutral ships would be absolute contraband. The definition is in Article 24&#x2014;
<quote>"The following articles, suspectible of use in war us well as for purposes of peace, may, without notice, be treated as contraband of war, under the name of conditional contraband."</quote>
And the first of these things is foodstuffs&#x2014; the food of the people which we import at the appalling rate of &#x00A3;484 a minute, including tobacco. Here, under this precious Article, all this food may, without notice, be declared conditional contraband. Article 34 goes on to show how this conditional contraband is converted into absolute contraband, and one of the reasons is that it may be taken directly to a port which may be a port of supply for the army. Under the old law, it used to be a port of naval and military equipment&#x2014;a port, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, said, of equipment, like Ports-

mouth. The States who are going to sit in judgment, on us, would be bound to construe it as it is put here, not according to what the Lord Chancellor or the Government says it means.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02686"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble Lord does not want to mislead the House. I would not presume to set my opinion against his as to construction, but we told you plainly by a written document that our construction is just the same as that acknowledged by the noble Earl. We have said we will not bring this into effect unless we get the consent of the other nations to the same construction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02687"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: When the phrase comes up it will then be time to discuss it and see if it is adequate. But my contention is that there is a great deal more that has to be altered in the Declaration and the Report to carry out the intent-ions of the Government. Whole pages will have to be redrafted. As it stands, the Report will occasion much confusion, as in several places it is impossible to reconcile it with the Declaration itself. I do not wish at this late hour to detain the House, but I should like to say that the Lord Chancellor, whom I personally very much revere, has made a most touching appeal to the House, from his point of view, not to go behind the Agreement arrived at, after due consideration I think he said, on this very important matter. I have just come back from Canada, where a similar thing has happened. What did we have there? We had a Ministry, without any mandate from the people, without even their knowledge, signing an Agreement with the United States with respect to certain reciprocity arrangements. After signing it they referred that document to the people. They were committed to it, but the people would have none of it, and I venture to say that if this Declaration of London, with its Prize Court which I have attempted to very briefly describe-though I have not done justice to the subject&#x2014;if this Prize Court Convention and the Declaration of London were submitted to the people of this country they would receive a most emphatic condemnation if one can judge from the declared opinion of those representative bodies which have considered them. I am sorry that the noble Earl rather scoffed
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0430"/>
<col>851</col>
at the Chambers of Commerce. I can only say that as far as I am concerned I have looked into this Declaration with an absolutely unprejudiced and unbiased mind. It was, I acknowledge, the impartiality of ignorance which was admittedly shared by a large number of people, as the country was not aware of what was being done in its name. But the. London Chamber of Commerce appointed a Committee a year ago last August. We asked others to attend, men learned in the law, especially in maritime law, representatives of the grain trade, Lloyd's, and all the various great industries of the country. We sat, I think, for a month. It was not a superficial examination but a most careful consideration of every clause of this Bill, and we drew up a reasoned commentary which we forwarded to the Government, who treated it with a very slight sort of attention. But the main thing is this that if this proposal was submitted to the country I am perfectly convinced, judging from the feelings of the representatives of the shipping trades, the Chambers of Commerce, both the Services, the corn trade and insurance societies, it would receive a most emphatic condemnation. I do implore the Government not to ratify the Convention or force a Bill on the country to which I firmly believe the whole country is most determinedly opposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02688"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL BRASSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my observations will be brief. As President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, I have had ample opportunity of knowing their opinions. The majority are opposed to the ratification of the Declaration. They might have taken a different view if they had been consulted at an earlier stage and Mr. McKinnon Wood's able addresses had been delivered before and not after the Conference. Chambers of Commerce are not unanimous. In the Port of Liverpool Mr. Royden, President of the Steamshipowners' Association, spoke in favour of ratification. My Lords, not without cause, the Government has been moved to take action in this matter. Our experience of the Russo-Japanese war had shown, not for the first time, that international law was in a state of chaos. A tribunal was needed more satisfactory than the Prize Courts of the enemy. The subject was brought forward at the Hague. It was there decided that an International Prize Court should be
<col>852</col>
established, and that representatives of the Powers should meet to draw up an Agreement as to the law which the Court should administer. We invited delegates to meet in London. It became the duty of the British Government to make choice of representatives. The noble and learned Earl who sits on the Cross-Benches (Lord Desart) was the British Plenipotentiary. He is an eminent authority on maritime law. Our naval delegates were officers exceptionally qualified. Throughout the proceedings they were in close touch with the Admiralty. The Declaration was submitted to the Colonial Conference lately held. The Premiers had expressed regret that the Dominions had not been consulted. They were in a critical mood. After deliberations extending over two days, and hearing the explanations offered by Sir Edward Grey and the Prime Minister, a resolution moved by Sir Joseph Ward, approving the ratification of the Declaration, was passed by the members of the Conference, the Government of Australia abstaining. What, it may be asked, do we gain by ratification? It is an advantage to set up an International Court. At first view it did not seem, necessary that the members of the tribunal should include representatives of the minor Powers. The Lord Chancellor has explained the difficulties and the reasons why the Court is to be constituted in the manner proposed. It is an advantage to have a code of international law covering all points on which it is possible to come to an agreement. Let us not attach undue advantage to Codes. <i>Inter arma silent leges.</i> As the Royal Commission on Food Supply rightly observed, in a time of stress and strain the temptation to disregard legal restriction might easily become too great to be resisted by naval officers away from the control of their Government. We are brought to the old conclusion that to keep the sea free to the British flag we depend in the last resort on the Navy, and I take on myself the responsibility of saying that at, the present moment we are not unprepared.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02690"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Naval Prize Bill is a Bill to benefit foreign lawyers at the expense of British shipowners. In the Russo-Japanese war
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0431"/>
<col>853</col>
a few British merchant ships were captured and condemned by the belligerents. The amount of shipping lost was but a drop, as compared with the ocean of our total commerce. During, and after, that contest some of our shipowners complained about the uncertainty of war, and wished to make quite sure as to whether their ships would be captured or not under a variety of circumstances. Had they ever read history they would have known that there is no such thing as certainty in war; that they might as well have, asked for the moon or for certainty at auction bridge. Unfortunately, Sir Edward (key's knowledge of military history was also imperfect, and instead of telling them that they wore asking for what could never be guaranteed, he called a Conference of Continental Powers with large Armies, who proceeded to outvote the Island Power that relied on the sea for its food supply. <i>Que diable allait-il faire dans cettegal&#x00E9;erc.</i> Had the Declaration of London been in force during the Russo-Japanese war the owners of the "Knight Commander" would not have been entitled to compensation. She carried contraband and would have been sunk under Article 49. The owners of the "Oldhamia" might or might not have received compensation. It is not a certainty. But as a friend of the <i>entente</i> with Russia I regret that that country did not allow the "Oldhamia" case to go before arbitrators. It is not too late. If she did this it would allay a feeling of irritation, and make it easier for both countries to act in alliance with one another if it became advisable for them to do so.<lb/>
Some of the Conventions are worse than the Declaration. Article 1, Chapter 1, orders a belligerent to forward the captured despatches of his enemy, unopened, with the least possible delay. This is a thing that may be done in comic opera, but not in real life. Article 3, Chapter 2, practically orders our Admirals to allow the enemy's fishing boats to act as scouts and mine layers, until actually caught in the act. If in war a First Lord of the Admiralty was to insist on our naval officers doing these; things, I think that his subsequent lynching would be a matter of certainty, unless he could manage to shift the blame on to the shoulders of a naval man, as Newcastle did to Admiral Byng in the eighteenth century.<lb/>
<col>854</col>
A large number of retired Admirals have signed a petition against this Declaration. Mr. McKenna has endeavoured to pour contempt upon them, on the ground that only eleven of them had served as Senior Flag Officers. According to his theory, their opinions alone could be allowed to count. He said that no distinguished officer whose opinion upon a technical subject is worth more than that of the man in the street is against the Declaration. He also said that naval officers vary in their views; but that upon the construction of a Treaty of this kind naval opinion is not liable to be well-informed. Now there are some stations on which it is possible to serve as Senior Officer of a Fleet without having ever to settle an international question. The senior officer present is the man who has to settle international difficulties, then and there, on the spot, whether he be a captain, commander, or lieutenant. His rank has nothing whatever to do with it, as long as he is the senior officer present. He must often act on his own responsibility when out of the reach of telegraphs. He can consult the law books supplied by the Admiralty, but he has generally taken the precaution to read them beforehand. Several of our leading Admirals have lately written their own memoirs, and those landsmen who take the trouble to read them will find that most of them had to do international work of importance, on their own responsibility, long before they reached the rank of Commander-in-Chief. On many occasions officers of the rank of captain have declared blockades and laid down the rules for them entirely on their own responsibility. On several occasions they have shown that they knew more of international law than Colonial lawyers. The retired Admirals of the present day were brought up among blockades and international questions from their boyhood. To have taken part in the blockades during the Russian War, to have watched the proceedings of both blockaders and blockade runners and of Southern cruisers while employed in protecting British interests during the Civil War from 1861 to 1865 was a far better education in practical international law than can be obtained by listening to theoretical lectures by inland lawyers.<lb/>
Of these retired Admirals I was a contemporary. At the age of fourteen, an age at which the international lawyers
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0432"/>
<col>855</col>
were making Latin verses with the aid of a "Gradus," or studying compulsory Greek, I was sent on board the "Duke of Wellington," the "Dreadnought" of the day, flagship in the Baltic, in obedience to signal, for the purpose of transcribing Admiral Dundas's orders for blockading part of the Baltic coasts. In 1857, at the age of sixteen, I was up the Canton River when some Law Court at Hong Kong endeavoured to interfere with the proceedings of a captain of Marines, who, while in command of Macao Fort, near Canton, had captured some junks. The Admiral, Sir Michael Seymour, soon put that Court into its proper place, and, acting on the maxim of <i>Inter arma silent leges,</i> promptly proclaimed a blockade of the Canton River, and allowed no person to enter it without a naval permit. It was admitted by the Foreign Office that no mistake was made by any British naval officer during the Civil War in America, though action had to be taken in some hundreds of cases. Common sense, a practical knowledge of the necessities of the sea, combined with study of the law books on board their ships, carried them safely through. All our errors of judgment in that war were made by the Government and by lawyers, who did not understand war. Of the "Alabama" claims not one sixpence was ever paid in consequence of the mistake of a naval officer. They were all due to lawyers, who meddled with war of which they knew nothing. Our greatest mistake&#x2014;namely, permitting the escape of the "Alabama"&#x2014;was due to the bungling of the Foreign Office and its legal advisers, neither of which departments, apparently, knew anything about the value of time in war. The ship was allowed to sail, while they wasted precious moments in consulting one another. One of the lawyers was ill and he had no understudy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02694"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: I am relying on what I read in the Blue Books last week. Now I pass to what I was saying about the "Alabama." It was known for weeks beforehand that the "Alabama" was being built. She was launched on the 15th of May, and did not sail until the 29th of July; yet the lawyers and the Foreign Office reserved their decision, just as if they had been sitting in an ordinary peaceful Law Court, until the time for action had passed. They ought to have read up their law books while the ship was being built, instead of waiting to do so until she was ready for sea.&#x2020;<lb/>
Other cases occurred in which the sailors were right and the lawyers wrong. The "Alabama" commissioned a prize, the "Tuscaloosa," as a man-of-war. Admiral Sir Baldwin Walker thought that the "Alabama" had no right to do this, and that the "Tuscaloosa" ought to be seized. The Attorney-General at the Cape said, "No," and she was allowed to sail. Then the Home Government in England said that she ought to have been detained. On her return to the Cape she was arrested accordingly. Afterwards the Home Government said that as she had not been seized on the first occasion she ought to be released, which was done. After the war I met the Confederate officer (Lieut. Low) who had commanded the "Tuscaloosa." The British officer who was sent to board her was the present Admiral Sir William Kennedy, who is one of those who has signed a petition against the ratification of the Declaration. Take again the case of the "Oreto," a sister ship to the "Alabama." She arrived at Nassau flying the British flag in April, 1862. The senior naval officer present, Commander McKillop, of the "Bulldog," wished to place her where she could be under proper supervision, but the local Attorney-General objected. When the "Bulldog" had sailed, Captain Hickley, of the "Grey-
<quote>&#x2020;NOTE.&#x2014;Lord Sanderson's contention is correct. I was misled by M. Staempfli, one of the arbitrators, who in his summing up, under the heading of "Facts of the Case," stated that on the 23rd of. June Mr. Adams made his first representation to Lord Russell, and that on the 25th June Lord Russell transmitted this remonstrance to the Law Officers of the Crown. M. Staempfli appears to have applied the term Law Officers of the Crown to a firm of Liverpool solicitors who were consulted in the matter. The Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General did not receive the papers until the 28th July.&#x2014;ELLENBOROUGH.</quote>

hound," became senior officer. He sent an officer on board the "Oreto" and proposed to send her to the Commodore or Commander-in-Chief, on his own responsibility, but the Governor of Nassau and his Colonial lawyers prevented him. We had to pay heavy damages afterwards. For on leaving Nassau she went to Mobile, where the was duly commissioned as a Confederate man-of-war under the name of the "Florida." I met her afterwards at Bermuda. I recollect supplying one of her officers with refreshment of a fluid nature in the wardroom of H.M.S. "Shannon," which may, or may not, have been a breach of neutrality on my part. The United States ship "Wachusett" also appeared at Bermuda while, I was there in chase of the "Florida."' Later on she met the "Florida" at the neutral port of Bahia. Brazil being at that time a weak Naval Power the "Wachusett" ran alongside the "Florida" in the night and captured her. To prevent further complications or remonstrances the "Florida" was accidentally sunk on her way to the United States.<lb/>
Now, the captain of the "Wachusett" achieved his object, as the "Florida" did not capture, any more Northern merchant ships. I mention this case to show how utterly naval officers disregard so-called internal ional law when the interests of their country demand it, and their country is prepared to back them. We must expect similar cases to arise in future. But when in harbours belonging to powerful neutrals the captains of belligerent ships behave very differently. For instance, when the U.S. ship "Iroquois" met the "Sumter," which was a much weaker ship, at Martinique, she steamed up to within fifty yards of her, but did not dare to violate the neutrality of France. A similar case occurred in January and February, 1862, inside the Isle of Wight. When in the Solent the "Shannon" received orders to open fire on the "Tuscarora" if that vessel interfered with the Confederate cruiser "Nashville" and did not give her twenty-four hours start. I saw the "Nashville" steam, out in broad daylight, close to both ships. It was my first watch that night-8 till 12. The "Tuscarora" had a large cabin port, and with my telescope I watched the American captain writing his despatches and consulting his law books until a late hour. I may add that the "Shannon" was a much larger vessel than
<col>858</col>
the "Tuscarora," and the "Tuscarora" was more powerful than the "Nashville."<lb/>
I mention these things to show that my contemporaries, the Admirals on the Retired List, had exceptional opportunities for learning more about international law as actually practised than the men in the street, to whom, Mr. McKenna compared them. Is not being actually engaged in carrying on a blockade as a belligerent, or watching a blockade as a neutral to see that your country's interests are not injured, a better school of international law than poring over a number of cases of ancient Prize Court law, in which no mention is made of the strategy or the real reasons which caused a belligerent to seize a neutral ship? In some cases it is most important to seize a ship; in other cases seizure can have little effect on the war. Does Mr. McKenna suppose that Admirals on being retired forget all that they have learnt, either in youth or middle age, either as neutrals or as belligerents? They do not drink the waters of Lethe and forget what they learnt in youth and middle age when they go on the Retired List.<lb/>
In considering the definition of the word "base" in Article 34, it is as well to look up some of the precedents of the American Civil War. The Geneva Court held that Melbourne was "a base of operations" in the case of the "Shenandoah," because she had received coal and other supplies when at that port, and that Great Britain was therefore liable for her subsequent depredations. Sir Alexander Cockburn, the Lord Chief Justice, objected to this, and tried to get the Court to accept the following definition of a "base of operations"&#x2014;
<quote>"In naval warfare a base of operations would mean a port or waters From which a Fleet, or a ship of war, may watch the enemy and sail forth to attack with the possibility of falling back to the fort or water in question for fresh supplies or shelter for the renewal of operations."</quote>
With Sir Alexander Cockburn's clearly worded opinion and the Geneva precedent before them, I am afraid that any International Court, however constituted, would consider that every harbour in this island was a base. Sir Edward Grey, in answer to a Question in another place, has endeavoured to minimise the effect of this decision of the Geneva Court and Sir Alexander Cockburn's opinion. But I do not think that his arguments would convince any jury of moderate intelligence or
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0434"/>
<col>859</col>
any man of legal training. They are scarcely likely to be accepted even by the poly-chromatic Court that it is intended to call into existence. Why not give up the point at once and admit that it was overlooked when the Treaty was drawn up?<lb/>
It has been frequently asserted that the Declaration does not in any way affect the conversion of merchant ships into men-of-war on the high seas, that it leaves the position unaltered. Lord Des-borough has in the course of this debate given reasons why that is not the case, and I shall not, therefore, trouble this House by repeating them. Is it not quite clear that if the International Court decides that the capture of a neutral by one of these vessels is legal, that by so doing it will give a status to these ships which they have not had hitherto, and that the belligerent whose life is dependent on its commerce will be put in a worse position by such a decision. Mr. McKinnon Wood, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, stated that the number of ships fast enough to pay to convert, in the mercantile marine of our opponents, can be counted on the fingers of one hand, Now with a foreign Government it is not a question of paying to convert or of making prize money. It is a question of stopping a large portion of British trade, and thereby compelling Britain to sue for peace. Recollect that during a war with us the greater number of our enemies' merchant ships would be laid up, unable to earn money by carrying cargo. They would therefore be cheap. Secondly, it is not so much a question of escaping when once sighted by one of our fast cruisers, or of getting alongside of our best mail steamers, but of catching our tramps, or rather of frightening them off the sea; therefore a ship much slower than our cruisers, and only two or three knots faster than our tramps, might succeed in destroying numbers of our cargo boats before being herself caught by a cruiser. The food supply of Great Britain is chiefly carried by slow boats.<lb/>
Then I come to costs in belligerents' courts. One of the many blots in the constitution of the International Court is that it cannot give costs in the national court of the belligerent. In our war with France the expenses incurred in our own Prize Courts frequently exceeded the value of the ship and cargo, so that an injured
<col>860</col>
neutral might still be heavily out of pocket even if an international judgment was given in his favour, from having to pay law costs in the Court from whose decision he had appealed. With regard to prize money, Article 31 of the Prize Bill appears to me to deserve more attention than it has yet received. By it no prize money is granted for the capture of an unarmed ship. This is a bit of patchwork. I should have thought that the production of a Naval Prize Bill would have been a suitable occasion for the issue of a complete scheme of new regulations for the distribution of prize money. One of the assertions made by some of those who wish property at sea to be more sacred than human life is that naval officers are opposed to the immunity of property afloat on the ground that they may lose prize money. Some of our Admirals have served thirty years, and have not touched one penny of prize money. I myself may perhaps be considered one of the lucky ones, as I made about &#x00A3;12 in about nineteen years' service. At present I do not think that the chances of prize money enter into the calculations of a naval officer's pecuniary prospects, whether made by himself or by the man whom he hopes to make his father-in-law. It appears to me most unfair that the officers and ship's company of a cruiser that effects the bloodless capture of a ship like the "Lusitania," carrying one or two guns only, should make fortunes, whereas the mangled survivors of a destroyer that has sunk a "Dreadnought" should get nothing. In the olden days there were perpetual quarrels between officers and complaints among the men about prize money. It would be advisable, before a war breaks out&#x2014;before any captures are made to quarrel about&#x2014;to issue a well-thought-out scheme for the distribution of prize money. In former days, and even at present, a large share goes to the captains of ships. The captain of a ship was, and I believe is still, solely responsible for a seizure, and may be cast in damages that may ruin him. If he is an impecunious bachelor, he may choose to run risks that a man who has &#x00A3;20,000 and a family to provide for would hesitate, to undertake. For these reasons a large share of prize money was allotted to the captain as compensation for the risk that he ran. But surely some better method than this can be discovered for dealing with the responsibility of seizures.<lb/>

<col>861</col>
I do not wish to waste the time of the House by repeating the powerful arguments that have been adduced by other noble Lords. One of the chief faults of the Declaration and some of the Conventions is that they ignore geography. I consider that in time of war we shall be more likely to succeed and retain the friendship of neutrals if we make the question of what belligerent lights we claim a matter of geography and of the higher strategy, instead of relying on the interpretation of fixed rules. Look at Italy. It is a matter of vital importance to her that no mines should be sunk on the track of her transports, and that warlike stores should not reach the Arabs. Such rights as are necessary to ensure this she sticks to, others she waives as not essential to her success. She made war suddenly, so as to be able to proclaim a blockade before aims could be imported into Tripoli. As it was, she appears to have been a little late, as the "Derna" is said to have landed 10,000 stand of arms, which were distributed to the Arabs who have given so much trouble in the Oasis. But she does not enforce all her belligerent rights either in the Adriatic or in the &#x00C6;gean Out of deference to other Powers she has refrained from raising and arming the Albanians, though by so doing she would have given the Turks an infinity of trouble. If the Declaration is ratified, each Power will in war make its own reservations and interpretations, and the Declaration as a whole will receive about the same amount of attention that was vouchsafed to the Hague Conferences in the cases of Bosnia, Morocco, and Tripoli.<lb/>
As I have already said, one of the chief objections to the Naval Prize Bill is that when we are fighting in real earnest, with our daily bread at stake, we shall be obliged to disregard the Declaration and some of the Conventions, and that when we do so neutral Powers will consider that we are doing them a grievous wrong, and that we shall irritate them more than if, being bound by no Treaty, we only insist on the minimum of belligerent rights, leaving others unused, just as Italy is doing now. As regards the question of the interference of this House with a Treaty already made, it should be remembered that we are a democratic country and becoming still more so. In the United States the Cabinet and President cannot ratify Treaties without the consent of the Senate. In Canada something similar occurs. The more democratic the times
<col>862</col>
the more necessity there may be to have some check on the Treaty-making power which is now so entirely a matter of prerogative exercised by the Prime Minister.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02695"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the constitution of the International Prize Court, I may, perhaps, explain the position in which the British Delegates found themselves at the Hague in the year 1907 at the second Peace Conference. At such a Conference all Powers have the same voting power. The smallest State there has the same influence as one of the great Powers. The majority, therefore, at the Peace Conference was overwhelmingly composed of the smaller Powers, and when the constitution of this International Court came to be considered it was obvious that the claims of the smaller Powers could not be overlooked. I may also point out that the smaller Powers in many instances were the supporters of proposals made by the British delegates when they were opposed by the greater Powers. It is, therefore, against our interest to exclude representatives of the smaller Powers. Many of the smaller Powers have very distinguished international jurists whose services have been in great request in arbitration proceedings. Switzerland has been mentioned. Switzerland certainly is not a maritime country, but I am quite sure that the representative whom Switzerland will send to this International Court will be a man of high distinction and perfectly impartial. The same thing applies to Belgium. Then the South American Republics have been mentioned. Some of the most distinguished members of the Hague Conference came from, the South American Republics, and a very eminent representative of one of the great Powers at the Peace Conference expressed the opinion that the part played at the Conference by the South American Republics had been to him a revelation.<lb/>
I can also inform the House that a number of proposals were made with regard to the constitution of this Court, but that the proposal which was ultimately adopted was the only one which met with the approval of the, Conference. Therefore you are in this position, that either you have to accept the Court as it is here proposed or you have to abandon the idea of establishing such a Court. There can be no doubt of the great advantage to us in securing an appeal from the foreign
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0436"/>
<col>863</col>
belligerent's Prize Court to a Court mainly composed of neutrals and obtaining an interpretation of international law which will be binding on all the other Powers. It certainly is an immense advantage as regards the Declaration of London that we are sure that food can never be defined otherwise than as conditional contraband; and by the abolition of the doctrine of continuous voyage you have this further advantage, that food supplies in neutral merchantmen can reach without any difficulty harbours close to our own coasts, and that therefore the duty of the Navy in connection with those ships will be limited to the area between those neighbouring neutral harbours and our own coasts.<lb/>
The Declaration certainly is favourable to neutrals, and when we are neutral our great mercantile fleet will enjoy all the protection the Declaration gives. With regard to blockade, the Declaration has adopted the British view, which hitherto was not accepted. Instead of a restricted line in front of a port we shall have an area of operations, which will be greatly to the advantage of our blockading fleet. As to converted merchantmen, it should not be forgotten that under the Convention the commander and the officers of the converted merchantman must be taken from the Navy of the country to which it belongs; therefore it will not have any attribute of a privateer, but will be assimilated to a man-of-war of the Power which converts. With regard to the destruction of neutral vessels, it should not be overlooked that our Fleet will have the same right of destroying neutral vessels which according to the Declaration will be given to other Powers with limitations which have been inserted in the Declaration, and which seem to me to be of great importance.<lb/>
The Declaration is the, first step in the direction of the codification of international law. No doubt we have not obtained all that we wished to obtain, and we could not expect to obtain it. Neither could we expect, when we enter into a Conference of this kind, that other Powers will accept the interpretation of international law which our Courts have laid down. But I would urge on the House the great importance of not defeating this attempt, to come to air international understanding, and I would point out the deplorable effect which it will produce abroad if we at this hour refuse
<col>864</col>
to ratify the Declaration which we have invited the other Power? to elaborate, and which at the Imperial Conference has been accepted by the representatives of the Dominions with the exception of Australia. If this House incurs the great responsibility of preventing ratification of this Declaration, our representatives at International Conferences will find it more difficult to obtain the assent of other Powers to proposals made by them. To establish such a precedent seems to me to weaken cur influence as a great Power.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02696"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDERSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have felt reluctant to address your Lordships upon a question upon which so much has been said and written, and which does not seem to me to be very well adapted for examination in Parliamentary debate, but there are one or two points upon which it may be useful that I should say a few-words from personal experience. I shall confine myself strictly to the question, and shall endeavour to be brief. In the first place, as regards the composition of I the International Prize Court, about which; the noble Lord who has just spoken and previous speakers have said a good deal, I should like to mention that in the correspondence with the German Government which was laid before Parliament as to the seizure of German mail vessels in the South African war, Lord Salisbury quoted as a I convincing argument the opinion of the eminent German jurist Professor Bl&#x00FC;ntschli. When that Despatch was drafted there was some question as to how Professor Bl&#x00FC;ntschli should be described. He was really a Swiss and had been a member of the Swiss Government in revolutionary times; after the counter-revolution he retired to Munich and passed the rest of his life as a professor there and afterwards at Heidelberg. I need scarcely remind your Lordships that neither the Grand Duchy of Baden nor Bavaria is a maritime State, yet Professor Bl&#x00FC;ntschli's views on maritime international law are everywhere received with great respect. Then there is another publicist&#x2014;Monsieur Calvo&#x2014; whose treatise on international law is received with respect everywhere as a great authority on modern practice. Monsieur Calvo was an Argentine diplomatist, and I venture, to assure your Lordships that if you had to carry on a controversial correspondence with any of these minor States, it will not be any deficiency of legal knowledge or ability that you will
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0437"/>
<col>865</col>
have discovered in the course of the controversy.<lb/>
My Lords as regards other provisions of the Convention it would be better that some one with legal knowledge should defend them. But I notice that two noble Lords who have spoken to-night, however much they may have examined it, have not yet succeeded in finding that the Convention, in Article VIII, gives to the tribunal the right of awarding damages. I will turn to another point. It has been objected that this Convention will invalidate or destroy the right of neutrals to protest against improper action on the part of a belligerent and to use diplomatic pressure for its prevention. I have been quite unable to discover the foundation for that assertion. If you look at the correspondence to which I have already alluded on the subject of the seizure of German mail steamers, you will find that we answered the German Government by stating that the seizure of the "Bundes-rath" would be dealt with by the British Prize Court. But the objection made by Germany was that it should not go before a Prize Court at all, and if at that time the Declaration of London and the International Prize Court had both been in existence that contention would not have been in the least degree altered, but, on the contrary, strengthened. The German Government would have said, "' We do not consider that the matter ought to go to a Prize Court at all. We contend that by the proper interpretation of the Declaration of London the vessel is not liable to seizure; by Article 07 of that Declaration you are bound to give proper instructions to your naval officers, and you are bound to see that the Declaration is carried out, and we insist upon it that those instructions should be given." Therefore they would have had stronger grounds for their protest than they had, for I did not think their protest was absolutely well-founded at the time.<lb/>
Then it is said, "Yes, neutrals may be able to protest; but the Declaration is vaguely worded." But however vague it may be, the present state of international law on these contested points is still vaguer and more unsatisfactory. I should like to give your Lordships an example. It has been made a reproach against the Government that they have not succeeded in getting any prohibition of
<col>866</col>
the commissioning of merchant vessels as ships of war on the high seas. From the language employed one would suppose that the British nation had been protesting against this vigorously and consistently, I will not say from the time of Noah's Ark because I do not want to exaggerate, but at all events from the time of the maritime Declaration of Paris abolishing privateering. What are the facts? The "Alabama" escaped from England and was commissioned and received her armament and crew either on the high seas or on the extreme verge of Portuguese territorial waters near the Azores. She went out and captured a large number of prizes, all of them United States vessels and she sank them with the exception of one which she commissioned on the high seas as a tender. Did we denounce her as a pirate? Did we say it was a resort to barbarism, or did we refuse her admission to our ports? Not at all. We received her and treated her as a ship of war, and after some hesitation we decided that her prize was to be received as a ship of war also; and when I was at Geneva during the "Alabama" Arbitration we were employed, under the direction of Sir Roundell Palmer, the first Lord Selborne in arguing for all we were worth that it was the only course we could take, and that we were bound to accept her as a properly commissioned vessel of war. The tribunal thought otherwise. The British representatives alone dissented. The rest of the tribunal held that we ought not to have received her into our ports, or given her the immunities of a ship of war when she had obtained that position by the breach of our neutrality. As we paid a million and a-half for the doctrine we had acted on, we have got a perfect right to alter it now, and no one, I think, can throw it in our teeth that we thought otherwise then.<lb/>
But this is what I wanted to call your Lordships' attention to. We have two principal English text books on international law. One is the work of the late Mr. Hall, and is published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford. The other is a work by Professor Westlake, which has recently been published by the University Press at Cambridge. Mr. Hall expresses his opinion that the decision of the tribunal was unfortunate and wrong, and Professor Westlake says that there can be scarcely any doubt that the tribunal were perfectly right. In those circumstances I really do not know
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0438"/>
<col>867</col>
how we are going to argue that there is any clear and definite rule on this point founded on international law, nor do I think we ourselves are in the best position for obtaining a confirmation of the doctrine that the commissioning of vessels on the high seas is to be universally condemned. I think that other Powers if we appeal to them may very well say, "It really does not matter to you, you have a huge Navy and ports all over the world, and if you want to commission merchant ships you can do it with the greatest ease; why should you expect that we who have not got these advantages should all unite together for your convenience in condemning the practice." It is quite possible these other nations may in time come to the conclusion that upon the whole it would be better for them also that the practice should be condemned, but I do not think that the argument comes extremely well from us.<lb/>
Then, finally, my Lords, I should like to say something about the international position in which this country would be placed if the Government is prevented by this House from being a party to this arrangement. Then; can be no doubt whatever that we took a considerable part in proposing and advocating the Convention for the International Prize Court. Subsequently we ourselves came forward and invited the Conference to meet here to draw up a Code of Law by which that tribunal should be guided. According to the usual practice the senior British Plenipotentiary presided over the Conference, and the British Plenipotentiaries had the great advantage of being in direct communication with the Cabinet and with the expert advisers of the Government. Under those circumstances this arrangement was made and signed. Since then it has been accepted, and its ratification has been approved by the Imperial Conference, and it has been equally accepted by the House of Commons. It was eon-eluded under the sanction of one Board of Admiralty, and it has since been acquiesced in, as far as I know, by two other Boards of Admiralty. Under those circumstances if this House interferes to stop any further progress we shall be placed, it appears to me, before other countries in a very damaging and disadvantageous position. The discussion of the Declaration of London has done one thing, at all events. It has awakened the
<col>868</col>
country to the risks of a great naval war. But there seems to be a sort of impression that if we get rid of the Declaration we should get rid of this danger also. That is a delusion. The risks are there, they are the results of our circumstances, and they will remain.<lb/>
But you cannot really get rid of the Declaration of London. You can refuse to be a party to it now, but the Declaration of London will still remain on record as what is really the foundation of international law, a general consensus of the Government represented. You can put yourselves in a position in which you will get no advantage from it. But you cannot put yourselves in a position in which you will get any support when it is urged against you. You may say, "This and that practice was, no doubt, sanctioned by the Declaration of London, but we have refused to ratify the Declaration of London." But other countries will reply, "After all it represents the general opinion, and we are not going to support the reverse." I cannot help feeling, my Lords&#x2014;I do not wish to use a harsh term&#x2014;that the Government might have adopted an attitude a little less arrogant towards the opposition that has been aroused in the country by the Declaration. It is in my opinion ill-informed, but it is genuine and deserves consideration. If the Government had come forward and invited some kind of discussion, I believe that much of this trouble might have been avoided. But I still cannot see that we shall gain anything by tying the hands of the Government and preventing them from taking part in an arrangement which is undoubtedly in many respects a step in advance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02697"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will have heard with the greatest interest the speech of Lord Sanderson, who speaks with so much authority from his long connection with the Foreign Office, and one is extremely glad to think that in such matters he can assist your Lordships' House. I should not have intervened in this debate at all but for the pointed allusion made to me by the noble Earl opposite (Earl Beau-champ), who said, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill that I had made a statement with regard to international law with which he did not agree. It may be that the noble Earl is only stating his
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0439"/>
<col>869</col>
own opinion on the matter, and I will endeavour to answer it with all the respect I can. But I think before he says that what I have said was not agreed with I am entitled to know whether he means agreed with by lawyers or experts in the matter, or only not agreed with as a matter of opinion; because I shall "venture to repeat again what I said on the last-occasion, and I will attempt, if I can, to justify what I said as bearing upon the question now before your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I say again that when we are considering whether what we get under this Bill, speaking of the tribunal and the law to be administered by the tribunal, is to this country's advantage, we ought to consider what we are losing. I will try to repeat what I said on the last occasion. I cannot quote my words, but the noble Karl has them. This is wherein he differs from me, I understand. I said that the law of England has been respected and adopted, and has formed the foundation of international law in all the civilised countries of the world. I do not, of course, pretend to say I quote the words exactly, but that is what I said, and that is what I understand the noble Earl does not agree with. As I have said, if the noble Earl says I am wrong I should have been glad to argue it. If he states that he relies on somebody else, then I venture to say with full responsibility that I was absolutely right. The prize law of the civilised world has been built up by the Courts of this country, and subsequently followed by the Courts of America, particularly the United States, and as my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury said to-night, the judgments of Lord Stowell and Dr. Lushington, and of all the distinguished Judges of Prize Courts, have been treated as forming the foundation of the principles of international law. When the noble Earl says somebody, I do not; know who, does not agree in that, I can only say I have read and studied both the works which Lord Sanderson referred to, and many others, over and over again, and works by German lawyers and lawyers of the United States, and many of the judgments which the great Chief Justice Marshall delivered in Prize Courts, and it will be found that the decisions to which Lord Halsbury has referred and the decisions to which I have referred, and the rest of these opinions, are treated by these writers as being the foundation of legal
<col>870</col>
principles in prize law. I am quite sure my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack will not dispute that for a moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02698"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Of course, everybody knows that English maritime law is the foundation of international prize law.</membercontribution></p>

But I say we have got a system of jurisprudence in prize cases based upon 200 years of English decisions, followed by the Prize Courts in the United States and respected by all civilised nations. Now that is what we may be giving away. I think we are giving that up, but that is a matter, again, of opinion. What are we going to get for it? Here I come to the question which my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack did not deal with so fully as I should have liked. We are going to get a Court in which the British Judge is to have one voice out of fifteen. They an; all to be equal, and I quite believe, as Lord Sanderson has stated, that some of these nations will produce a very respectable, international lawyer, though he might only be a professor or one who had only studied international law from the book point of view. But, after all said and done, we have no recognition in this so-called Code&#x2014;and with all deference to Lord Reay I do not think it can be called a Code&#x2014;of any of the principles of international law as applied in prize cases to which respect has been given in our Courts. On the contrary, as I understand&#x2014;I am not going to enter into this at length&#x2014; there is applied some sort of rule of what the tribunal think to be just and right, and we are really abandoning&#x2014;it may be the price is worth it&#x2014;the only rights we have of having an adjudication in our own Courts. We are abandoning there the principles on which the cases have been decided.<lb/>
I entirely agree with my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack that an appeal would be a matter of very great importance and value. I said on the last occasion when I spoke that I would sooner argue a point of international law&#x2014;and I do not speak without experience in the matter&#x2014;on the construction of some recognised and received Code than have to cite a number of authorities in order to
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0440"/>
<col>871</col>
prove a principle first. It is clear that we are going to get something, but, at any rate, we ought to sec what we are going to lose, and personally I am not satisfied with leaving it absolutely at large to such a tribunal&#x2014;a tribunal upon which, as I have said, the British feeling will be only represented by one-fifteenth. I agree with my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack that the actual number may be not excessive, and I think he is quite right in what he said as to the "Franconia," but still the quality of the tribunal is better than the quantity, and I should be more satisfied if I thought this tribunal would really represent, and be representative of, the opinion of lawyers of experience in international law. I do not myself like the hazardous position of the Court, and the absolute freedom with regard to previous existing authorities.<lb/>
Nobody can have failed to be struck by the words of the able and eloquent speech of the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack. I am not going to argue with him upon all the various questions which he raised. I said what I had to say on the last occasion, and I will not repeat it. I will only say that while I certainly agree with the noble and learned Earl on certain points, there are a good many other points that he did not think it necessary to touch upon. But when he says we ought not to refuse to pass this Bill at even the greatest cost because it is exactly following out what has been developed by this conference in London, I think he rather gives the go-by to the actual position. This is the only opportunity we have had of dealing with the provisions of the Bill, and it does seem to me that if some of us feel, either strongly or weakly, as the case may be, that the Bill is not to the advantage of the country, it is our duty to state our reasons and to put forward arguments, which can be answered or not, why we think the price we are receiving for what we are giving up is inadequate.<lb/>
In that connection there is one matter which seems to me not to be quite sufficiently appreciated by either my noble friend or His Majesty's Government, and I hope His Majesty's Government will think it fair to give me some little information on the subject. We have never been told how many other nations, parties to this Convention, have ratified the Convention or Agreement, and I think before Great
<col>872</col>
Britain is asked to ratify we ought to know whether the other nations, great or small, are prepared to ratify it. We ought to know whether it is true, as the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack said, that if we reject this Bill we are going to throw everything into chaos. It does seem to me that if our position is that we are really being asked to pull the chestnuts out of the fire, being the first great country to give effect to this, then other considerations may arise, I do not know what the United States will do. I have no idea, but it seems to me that those considerations are of some importance.<lb/>
I will not detain your Lordships except to say a word on one other point. I am bound to say that I think the offer made by His Majesty's Government, if it had been incorporated in the Bill, would require to be carefully considered. I understood the Government were ready to give an undertaking that, they would not either enter into the Declaration or make any arrangement until they were satisfied on two points&#x2014;one being the point with regard to how far the Report was going to be treated as part of the Convention. I must point out again that there were two or three matters in which the Convention was inconsistent, and therefore to treat it in that way would, not solve the difficulty. Then we are entitled to know what safeguard we have for an undertaking which, of course, will be honourably performed by the present Government; but when we are dealing with an Act of Parliament its influence will extend beyond the life of that Parliament. It seems to me that if that sort of suggestion is going to be made it should be embodied in the Bill and put in a shape so that we can judge of it; otherwise we are trusting the Executive, not knowing exactly what they mean, and only having a promise that they will not ratify until there has been an arrangement made with regard to the Report and an understanding as to the meaning of the word "base."<lb/>
I am not going again, as I have said, to argue what I tried to point out on the last occasion as to the dangers that arise under the base clause, as I will call it of the Declaration. But I say this House should have an opportunity of judging of whether or not what is going to be agreed to would be satisfactory. I am quite aware that the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack said that Parliament was to be satisfied,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0441"/>
<col>873</col>
but it does seem, to me that it is not asking too much that there should be a clause put in the Bill, and not a mere understanding which may give rise to discussions hereafter. That is all I have to say with regard to this question. I am most unwilling that any difficulty should be created by the refusal of this country to ratify. I said on the last occasion, and I repeat it that I fully recognise that it is a grave responsibility to render for the time being abortive the proceedings that have taken place. But when there are paramount interests at stake, when the security of the Empire and the continuance of the food supplies of this country may be seriously impaired, we ought not to hesitate to decline to give our consent, whatever the consequences may be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02700"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I venture to intrude on your notice for a few moments in consequence of the remarks which have been just addressed to us with so much authority by the Lord Chief Justice, My noble and learned friend is very much concerned lest the great fabric of international law which has been established mainly on the foundations of the decisions of the English Courts should be treated as of no account, and we are going to start afresh in the evolution of law, leaving it to this new tribunal to declare what they think to be, the law on all points which may arise in disputes between nations. My Lords, I have not so understood the Declaration of London, nor the Report which accompanies that Declaration. According to what I understand the Report to be, the decisions of International Prize Courts in the future are to follow the received doctrines of international law. That is to say, they are to follow on the lines which have been laid down by our own great Judges, and which, as my noble and learned friend said, have been adopted by the Courts and the Governments of other nations. They are to follow upon these lines, and it is only where the doctrine is left obscure, it is only where it wants further development, it is only where it is in dispute&#x2014;it is in these cases and in these cases only that the Court of Appeal is to decide what it thinks right in pursuance of what has been hitherto adopted and is in accordance with equity and justice.<lb/>
Now if I am right in that contention, the concern of my noble and learned friend is misplaced. The great body of international law which we have inherited is kept. It is
<col>874</col>
in its development only that we allow for the action of the new Court of Appeal, and in that they will not have a free hand, because in that development they will be bound to pay respect to what has gone before. I do not wish to prolong this debate or repeat what I said before with respect to the Declaration of London and the interpretation of the terms therein, but I want to call particular attention to the point last laid down by the Lord Chief Justice. He said that if the offer made by the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp and repeated by my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack, had been made beforehand, if it could be made binding, we might have passed the Bill, for a great deal of consideration was due to it, and much weight would have to be attributed to it. I hope I do not misinterpret my noble and learned friend. He attributed the utmost weight to the offer made by Earl Beauchamp and repeated by the Lord Chancellor being put in a formal binding fashion. It was made firm enough, he admitted, so far as the present. Executive went, and if it could be put in a formal and binding fashion which should bind not only them but possible successors, he said he might be of a different temper. If we could secure that interpretation, or, rather, agreement in interpretation, with the other Powers for which the Government looked and upon which alone they would ratify the Declaration of London, if we could make that secure, then it was said you should hesitate to refuse to pass the Second Reading of this Bill.<lb/>
My Lords, I ask you this question. Does not the position taken up by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice point to this, that you should be allowed to read the Bill a second time and consider whether it is not possible in Committee to put in a provision reserving the ratification of the Treaty, or what comes to the same thing, reserving the Order in Council which shall give effect to the part of the Bill which is in controversy, until an agreement has been arrived at, which should be laid before Parliament and be accepted by both Houses, upon the disputed point of interpretation with which alone we are concerned? That is the point. The Government say they will not ratify until they can obtain that agreement and submit it to Parliament, Parliament being open to reject it, and then the regulation will not take place. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice says that is
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0442"/>
<col>875</col>
not enough; it should be put into the Bill. Why should it not be put into the Bill? It is a difficult and delicate matter of draftsmanship. But do not decide that at this moment. Do not make it impossible, by refusing to read the Bill a second time, to have other opportunities of considering this. Assent to the Second Reading of the Bill, and then in a definite form in the Act of Parliament itself reserve the Order in Council which gives effect to this disputed part of the Bill until there is an agreement arrived at and submitted to Parliament and acquiesced in as regards the three matters which are in dispute.<lb/>
We are all satisfied of this. It is a very grave matter to refuse to make possible at this moment the ratification of the Declaration of London. It is an international act; it is not a thing concerning only the present position of municipal law, but a matter concerning the progress of international law and the authority of international conventions and the respect to be given to agreements with other Powers. It is important that this should not come to naught if it can be preserved. I have pointed out to your Lordships the way by which, while regarding what has been said by the Lord Chief Justice, the thing may be preserved, and how you may, when reading this Bill a second time, secure its benefit and preserve that authority over the interpretation of the Declaration of London in the Act of Parliament itself which the Lord Chief Justice desiderates. By so doing you may preserve the Declaration of London from coming to a miserable end, an end which we should all deplore.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02701"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Declaration of London has already on one occasion been fully discussed in your Lordships' House, and the only point for consideration, and the issue on the Bill on the Second Reading to-night, is the new International Prize Court. Naturally, therefore, many of the more weighty criticisms to-night have been directed to the constitution of that Court and the functions to be performed by it and it has been assumed, and probably quite rightly assumed, that, unless the creation of that Court is carried through the Declaration of London will probably not come into force. I know nothing of the intentions of the Government on this point, but I think it is probably assumed that the two
<col>876</col>
are interdependent. Now, my Lords, though I had personally nothing to do with the forming of the scheme for the creation of the International Court, I have naturally, in the course of my duties in connection with the Naval Conference which led to the preparation of the document known as the Declaration of London, had to consider its provisions over and over again, and having been so closely connected with all the proceedings I thought I should not allow this debate to close without saying one or two words to indicate the line on which some questions that have been the subject of controversy in the country and in this House and in another place should in my judgment proceed. I will indicate my view of the effect they really have, and whether they injure or improve our position. I have myself a very clear opinion on the point, but I do not propose to put my opinion in the way of advocacy, because I think in my position, especially on the issue before the House to-night, I should limit myself, so far as possible, to an explanation of the manner in which these things strike me and have struck me.<lb/>
Before the Hague Conference and after it, and during the Naval Conferences and during the discussion which led to the Declaration of London. I have tried to consider every point that has arisen, not as a jurist purely. I have very little claim to be a jurist, and certainly none as a sailor; though I had the assistance of the most distinguished lawyers and sailors who were in constant touch with the Admiralty. But I have tried to see practically how under existing conditions things work, and I have endeavoured to form an opinion as to how they would work if the Declaration were ratified and in force. It is only from that point of view that I wish to put before your Lordships' House some considerations of the subjects which have been mainly the subject of controversy. I do not think I need detain you long, because, after all, they have been fully discussed. One knows where the points of objection are, and they can be brought together without much difficulty.<lb/>
First of all much has been said to-night, and I feel some diffidence in adding anything to it, on the constitution of the International Prize Court. Now I suppose there is no real difference of opinion that
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0443"/>
<col>877</col>
it is not the ideal Court, and not the Court one would have created if one had had a free hand; but, as my noble friend Lord Reay explained, at the Hague Conference it was impossible to have a free hand. You had representatives of all the Powers assembled there in conference to take part in it, and you were endeavouring to create an International Court which should be acceptable to all and accepted by all. You could not under those circumstances altogether exclude the smaller Powers; and on this point I may say that I think they have, a good case for being included. It must be borne in mind that this Court is a Court to operate between the belligerent and the neutral and not between the belligerent and the belligerent. As to belligerents <i>inter se</i> it has no effect. It is a Court merely between the belligerent and the neutral, and although many of these Powers are not naval Powers and some are not maritime Powers, there is hardly, I suppose, any Power in the world, however small, that has not an interest in the neutral carriage of goods by sea. I cannot imagine that there can be any controversy on that. Therefore, though their interests may be relatively small, you could not say they had no interests at all. Having regard to these I difficulties&#x2014;it is not for me to praise or blame anybody about it&#x2014;I think perhaps the outcome was nearly as good as yon could expect. You have always the eight Great Powers, and even if the Court sat with its full numbers, which I suppose would not very often happen, you would always have a majority of the Great Powers, and as the Court is the Judge between belligerents and neutrals, there is the advantage, if it be an advantage, that the Court must obviously have a large majority, in any particular case that will be tried, who will be neutrals.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Selborne, I was glad to hear, said at the beginning of his remarks that he had no objection in principle to the creation of an International Court of Appeal. But I think I am right&#x2014;I hope he will correct me if I am not.&#x2014;that at a later stage of his speech he gave as an argument against it the possibility of our decisions which we thought right being reversed by that Court, and that we might have to execute a judgment of the International Court opposed to our own views of law and justice. You must have, if you are to have any International
<col>878</col>
Court of Law at all, that liability as a consequence if the International Court is to be independent at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02702"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I only mentioned that in connection with the conversion of merchantmen on the high seas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02703"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Earl's pardon if I have added anything to what he said, but that was my impression. There is no doubt it has been used as an argument a great deal; and if you press that argument, how can you possibly at any future time have any International Court at all? Any independent Court may decide against you. Therefore on the whole I think the International Court is the best we could get at the Hague. I do not wish to prophesy, but it seems to me nearly as good as any Court we are likely to get, and if on its composition it is to be rejected I think the prospect of any Internationa&#x0021; Court of Appeal will fade very far away.<lb/>
I have assumed that it was advantageous that there should be such a Court, because I do think this&#x2014;and I have tried to compare it with the system that now prevails&#x2014;what concerns us, as neutrals, are the decisions of belligerent Courts and not the decisions of our own Courts. It was clearly illustrated in the last war how very greatly we may suffer under these decisions, and how very difficult it is to get any redress unless you are prepared, which is very seldom the case, to appeal to the arbitrament of force. I remember very well the noble Earl on the last occasion when this matter was before this House saying that I had rather overlooked the pressure that might be brought by neutrals to bear on a belligerent who acted in excess of what was right or proper, and arbitrarily. But I did not forget it, though I did not mention it. I think it is not really a thing you can rely on. I quite agree that it is necessary for belligerents, especially belligerents equally matched, to have regard to neutrals. It is a matter of degree; but I think it would be utterly unsafe to rely on the intervention of neutrals. In the first place, the injury to any particular neutral or to his trade is very seldom such as to lead him to risk the awful disturbance of war. In the second place, with two exceptions I think hardly any large carriers who would
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0444"/>
<col>879</col>
be likely to have ships seized are Powers with great naval force behind them. In the third place, the danger of threats of war is that you bring on the field allies, known or unknown sometimes. If you once threaten war you do not know and cannot know where it is going to end, and no prudent Government lightly embarks on that. You make your protest; sometimes you succeed, and sometimes not; but as happened in the Russian war, if you do not succeed, it is generally wiser to cut your loss.<lb/>
I think the object of both the International Prize Court and the Declaration of London was to produce equality, so that we could, without sacrificing any principles which were vital or were important to us, place ourselves on equal terms, as a matter | of maritime law, with our possible adversaries; and what I think and what I contend is that in substance we have done that. At the present moment we are under considerable disadvantage in many ways. I pay all deference to anything my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice says, and if I criticise him I do it with great trepidation. I agree that the prize law of England has found its way into the text: books of nearly every country. Yon would find many jurists, though not all, who would say that is so; but we have to deal with things as they are. Not only did we find in the Russo-Japanese war that our principles were not applied, but when we invited the Powers coming to the Naval Conference to send in advance; their views on the subjects under discussion we found very serious divergences. Such were the rules they intended to apply in any wars in which they were engaged. That is the actual law we had to deal with. Those were the doctrines which they considered applied at that moment. The views were very divergent, and one object was to obtain something like equality.<lb/>
The points are rather difficult to deal with separately because they overlap. I take first, for convenience, the subject of the destruction of neutral ships, and I think there has been a great deal of misconception on this point. It has been stated freely, certainly in public controversy in the newspapers and I think in Parliament, that our rule and our practice is that under no circumstances must a neutral ship be destroyed, but that in all circumstances she must, if
<col>880</col>
she cannot be brought into the Prize Court, be allowed to go free. Now, my Lords. I do not find that anywhere as being subject to no exception. I quite agree that at the Hague our delegates were instructed to contend for that, and indeed we at the Naval Conference were instructed to contend for that; and extremely difficult we found it, because it was quite clear not only that there was nothing to support it beyond the general proposition as to neutral ships which everybody agreed on but we found we had destroyed ships, and we found that Sir W. Scott had said this, that no doubt you ought not, as a matter of law, to destroy a neutral ship, but if the service of your country or its interests demand that you should destroy it, then in that case you must compensate the neutral. I have all the cases here, though I do not quote them; but that is the substance of them.<lb/>
Now that is not the principle on which many foreign countries act, and we are always in this difficulty, that our Prize Courts and those of the United States are Courts manned by Judges who act quite independently of the Executive, and their decisions have to be accepted by the Executive. That is not the case with many foreign countries. Rules are made sometimes at the beginning of each war and they are approved as prize rules for that war, and they will be so administered. Therefore while our opponents lay down for themselves the conditions under which they would deal with neutral ships, we are bound by our Courts as to the principles on which we deal with neutral ships. That is a matter on which I think it was desirable to find the remedy of equal law administered in the same way by all Prize Courts, and, failing the proper administration of that law, some tribunal more independent than a belligerent Court to which we could appeal. In that view it was felt that, however broad the terms of law and equity and justice were in the Convention of the Hague, they were not sufficiently clear, and it was for that purpose that these rules in the Declaration of London were made, and it was hoped they would meet with acceptance. It has not altogether so turned out, but I think there has been a good deal of misconception.<lb/>
I would point out, on the question of destruction, that if we are to put forward
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0445"/>
<col>881</col>
our full contention that we can never destroy, we have the whole world against us. It is quite true that the United States and Japan expressed the pious wish that our proposal might be adopted. By the United States War Code of 1900, and in the Japanese Prize Rules of 1904 destruction is admissible, and, as I have already pointed out, I think we have no right to say that we do not admit it under conceivable and exceptional circumstances. Now the question is what are those circumstances to be. That is an extremely difficult thing to arrive at. We have had some experience of the views of Russia on that point. They destroyed altogether in the war six ships, of which four were British one Danish, and one Gorman. We got compensation in some cases, but not on the around of destruction, that was not admitted at all. There was no compensation whatever for destruction, and it was not even a matter to be dealt with in the Prize Court. I think it is extremely instructive in that connection, and it bears on that question to read a short extract from the judgment of the Russian Prize Court in the case of the "Knight Commander." This is on the question of destroying a vessel and of what is the liability. The Court said:
<quote>"The question of the regularity of sinking a vessel according to the exact interpretation of Article 5S of the laws relating to prizes is not one that is subject to the consideration of Prize Courts. Whether the extraordinary circumstances observe by the naval commander in the case, and which incited him to sink the vessel, were sufficient or not is a matter only for the superior officer and not for the Prize Court. The task of Prize Courts is to recognise a prize&#x2014;namely, whether the capture is legal or illegal; or, in other words, to confirm the right, of capture or to refuse such confirmation."</quote>
It is quite clear that no such rule would be recognised by our Courts. The whole matter would come before the Prize Court, and if Lord Stowell is followed we should have in all cases to pay the neutral.<lb/>
Now, what does the Declaration of London do? We first obtained the acceptance of the general principle and it was admitted that a neutral should not be destroyed save in exceptional circumstances as a general principle, and we endeavoured to obtain some agreement as to the circumstances under which she might be destroyed. We did not get all we wanted, and it was not likely we should, but we did obtain this. They are not quite the words which Lord Selborne read&#x2014;
<quote>"As an exception a neutral vessel which has been captured by a belligerent warship, and which
<col>882</col>
would be liable to condemnation, may be destroyed if the observance of Article 48 would involve danger to the safety of the warship or to the success of the operations in which she is engaged at the time."</quote>
It is quite impossible that there should not be circumstances in which a neutral ship might have to be destroyed. There might be occasions on which a naval commander by not doing so would betray his country. I will give two instances, because I think they illustrate the idea and purport of these rules. I am putting extreme cases, I quite admit, but one is entitled to do that. Suppose an enemy's fleet was near at hand and a neutral ship loaded with things they required was about to pass, and there was an action imminent and no men to spare. If that ship was allowed to go on it would give the very things they wanted to the other side; therefore it is clear that that ship, if she could not be disposed of in any other way, must be sunk. The illustration on the other point I wish to put is a plan involving a surprise or raid. When you come to a neutral ship bound either to such a port as is to be attacked or to a place in its proximity, you could not let her go on, because your whole plan would be done for. You would have to keep her and provide for her crew, and, if you could not do that, you must dispose of her as best you could under the circumstances. In that case ought that ship to be, allowed to go on? The words of the Declaration are directly applicable to such cases and the ships may be destroyed. But these words might be abused. If they are abused, what is your remedy now?&#x2014;the enemy's Prize Court. Whether the International Prize Court is ideally constituted or not, for purposes of that kind it is better that it should decide on the legitimacy of the act of destruction.<lb/>
Then there is the other feature which I indicated in the earlier part of my observations. At any rate we should be on even terms with our opponents if the Declaration is ratified; but now they will destroy us and we shall get no compensation, whereas if we destroy them we shall always have to pay compensation. Then I may also point out that the deterrents are very considerable as regards payment of compensation. The provision is that you compensate in all cases unless you show to the International Prize Court that the destruction was justified. You do not inquire whether there was contraband
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0446"/>
<col>883</col>
or anything else. The Court inquires whether the ship was liable to destruction, and if she was not you then get compensated. I do not think I need, having regard to the proposal made by the Government, deal at any length with the question of food supply. But I should like to say that I think neither the words "base" nor "enemy" nor any words to which exception has been taken could possibly, having regard to the provision as to conditional and absolute contraband and the obvious meaning of "base," be read as those who feel grave apprehensions on the subject have read them. I hold that opinion very strongly, but it is not necessary to go into detail on that. But I do say this, that it is a valuable thing to have got the admission that food under no circumstances is to be absolute, contraband, because I do not think it really can be disputed that there is now no general rule against it. We ourselves have really no definite general rule against it. Certainly France puts it definitely that she has not, and Russia has not, and Japan in the late war condemned food which there was no evidence was going to the enemy's forces. There is really no such general rule. I do not think anybody can prophesy what differences might arise. It is a question of degree and of circumstances. I was reading a book of Mr. Arthur Cohen's lately, in which he expressed in the warmest language his gratification at our being relieved of what he described as a very great peril.<lb/>
I also think the Declaration may claim something from the free list. It covers nearly all the raw material we have, and as long as it is possible that they could be treated as contraband we are not certain as to what might happen, but this provision as to the free list gives them absolute certainty. On the provision as to continuous voyage I do not think I need say very much to your Lordships. That is not really an English principle at all, though I think it would probably be adopted as such if the case arose now. It is an American principle really, and I do not think there is any case in our Prize Courts in which it has been adopted. But as regards continuous voyage for conditional contraband it really is of no service, because if goods which are not ear-marked in any way for the service of war go to a neutral consignee and there is nothing to show they are going to the enemy or that they are going to be used for war,
<col>884</col>
there is no conceivable case in which you could ever stop them, and I do not think it was any sacrifice at all, and that it is technically and strictly accurate to state that what we have done is a gain as regards continuous voyage for absolute contraband.<lb/>
I come to the question of the conversion of merchant ships at sea. There I think, on the whole, if there is a balance of opinion&#x2014;and it is a very difficult question o&#x2014;we stand to gain by the International Prize Court. I am sure I am right in saying that there is absolutely no proposition, either generally accepted or otherwise, that prohibits the conversion of merchant ships at sea. Conversion of merchant ships in national ports is accepted by all. The conversion of merchant ships in foreign ports or territorial waters is I rejected by all; it is only on the point of conversion at sea that this divergence or controversy arises. There is great difference of opinion about it, and so many take our view wholly or partially that I cling to the hope that if we take a step forward by a ratification of the Declaration in due process of time some agreement on this subject may also be found. I indulge the more in the hope because, on thinking the matter over very carefully. I doubt whether the advantage of conversion of merchant ships at sea would be commensurate with the loss which the converting power would inevitably sustain in the long run. This is really a conflict of interests. It is said "You are going to convert; there is no question of policy; but you want to make a rule by which you shall be the only nation who can convert, because you have ports all over the world, and we who have no ports are precluded from converting at all." It is a conflict of interests; and when in the absence of any rule of international law you find conflict of interests it is very difficult to see how, unless some other; factor comes in, you can obtain any measure of agreement.<lb/>
There are two views. One is the view that as you have complete control by municipal law over your own ships, disciplinary and criminal, therefore in consequence you have a right to convert your ships anywhere, except where your jurisdiction conflicts with that of some other Power. On the other hand, it is stated that this is importing a new danger, and importing a thing that is quite inconsistent with the ideas of modern war, and importing

perils that neutrals ought not to undergo. It was all fully discussed at great length at the Hague but without much result, though the division of powers on this subject is very considerable. We had on our side the United States. Spain, and Japan; Russia, Germany, and France were on the other side, while Italy and Austria were also on the other side while endeavouring to find a qualification to mitigate the danger. Thus the great naval Powers are divided in opinion, and as nearly all the smaller Powers' interests would be neutrals, the probabilities would seem to be rather in favour of a decision for than against our view. But what would be really the risk we would run? As a matter of law it is that there should be a decision of the Court condemning a neutral that was so captured. Of course we must run that risk, and you would have to run it in the case of any Court you go to. At the present moment you are quite certain that such a ship would be condemned in the Courts that she would go to in the countries I have named. That is a certainty. But in the other way you have a chance. Therefore I do think that on the whole you would gain even in that respect by the International Court.<lb/>
I want your Lordships to consider this. I have considered it a great deal, and I am very anxious about it. I do not think that the belligerent peril is a very serious one. If we have not sufficient cruisers we can convert at our ease in our own ports all over the world. You can have three or four ships to any one of any other of the Powers suitable for that purpose. We ought to know, and I am told we do know, practically every ship of other countries that is capable of conversion. I think we should know where those ships were, and we ought to be able to shadow them. They would have to take their coal in at neutral ports and they must coal up full at first. They would not have their ordinary cargo or passengers, and I think if that were the case, unless we were very ill-served at the neutral port where she was, we should call attention to Convention 18 providing that a neutral Government is bound to employ the means at its disposal to prevent the fitting out of a vessel which she has reason to believe cruises or is engaged in hostile, operations against a Power with which that Government is at peace. It is also bound to
<col>886</col>
display the same vigilance in order to | prevent the departure from its jurisdiction of any vessel destined for use in war. | I think on that representation the neutral Power would take the safer course and say they must make inquiries, and in order that the ship should be allowed to go it would be necessary for the other belligerent to say she was not intended to be converted, as otherwise they would be justified in detaining her, and by the time these negotiations were carried through we must be very ill-served if we have not taken precautions against that ship committing depredations. But we always have the fact that we can depend on our own Fleet, and that we must have enough cruisers to protect our trade. If we protect our trade we shall get our supplies of food and raw material; if we do not do so we shall not get them. I am quite certain we cannot be sufficiently supplied in neutral bottoms. It is 10 per cent., I think, now&#x2014;it is not a large proportion&#x2014; which is carried in neutrals. I know it is said that more will be carried in time of war, but I doubt it very much. I am not going to argue that at length, but I believe we should in fact have to carry more and not less in time of war in our own ships. We should never be able to depend on neutral bottoms to feed our population, and if we cannot protect our trade routes we could not carry on at all.<lb/>
My Lords, I have spoken, I am afraid, a good deal longer than I intended to speak, but I wanted to explain these points as they struck me, and I do think that we have in this Declaration sacrificed no belligerent right, no belligerent power, that can legitimately be used by any Power that makes war. That I look upon as the most important thing of all. I do not think we have made any sacrifice. I do not at all think we have incurred any further risks by the provisions as to the dealing with neutrals; but anyhow, even accepting that criticism&#x2014;which I do not accept&#x2014;you must remember that you cannot have it both ways. If you take a belligerent right you must concede a belligerent right, and if you take an exemption you must concede an exemption. I, think so long as we have the command of the sea and can protect our trade against any reasonable combination that can be brought against us, the equality which I contend is obtained by this Declaration will be of value in avoiding disputes when we are
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0448"/>
<col>887</col>
neutrals and in avoiding friction when we an; belligerents. So that in the one case we shall have a better chance of obtaining protection to our traders and ships, and in the other case we can carry on our belligerent operations more free from danger of friction with neutrals, which might in some circumstances enormously hamper us in the conducting of the war to a successful conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02704"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in a few minutes, so far as I am concerned, we shall, I presume, proceed to a Division, and I venture to express my earnest hope that every one of your Lordships before you decide how you will vote will be careful to consider the position in which this House now stands with regard to all Bills that come up from the House of Commons. Earlier in the evening the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack took my noble friend Lord Selborne rather severely to task for the levity with which he was advising your Lordships to destroy this Bill. Sly Lords, we are not now in the position of being able to destroy any Bill. All that we can do is to delay for a while a Bill which in our opinion has not yet been adequately considered either by the whole community or by the classes whom it most affects; and I venture to think that when in the case of any particular Bill we are satisfied that further opportunities for consideration on the part of the public are desirable, it is not only our right but our duty to defer the passage of the measure. I will quote a high authority in support of that view. A pamphlet headed "Home Rule Notes" has lately been published, accompanied by a preface or message from the Prime Minister, and I find in that preface the following passage&#x2014;
<quote>"It is of the essence of the Parliament Bill, both in its letter and spirit, that a Bill which becomes law under its operations must have commanded during three successive sessions the unswerving support of the House of Commons, depending directly in its turn upon a stable and consistent public opinion in the constituencies."</quote>
In this case what are we to say of the unswerving support of the House of Commons? The normal majority which His Majesty's Government are able to marshal is somewhere about 120. On the Second Reading of this Bill that majority, and I believe it was a strictly Party vote, fell to 70, and on the Third Reading, the other night, it fell yet again to 47. That does not look as if feeling in the House of Commons
<col>888</col>
was very solid or unswerving on the subject.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, is it true that public opinion is stable and consistent in regard to the merits of this measure. We know that the contrary is the case. It has been pointed out during the course of this debate that the whole of the Chambers of Commerce, and, I believe, virtually the whole of the shipping community are opposed to this Bill. It has been admitted that the opinion of naval authorities is much divided upon the subject, and my noble friend behind me reminded the House that although there had indeed been more or less ambiguous <i>obiter dicta</i> on the part of various naval officers of distinction, yet we have never been supplied with anything in the shape of an authoritative and considered opinion of the Board of Admiralty on this Bill. When I say that I do not suggest for a moment that the people of this country are not in favour of an International Prize Court, or of a reasonably conceived and carefully drafted Code of international law for that Court to administer. On the contrary, I believe that every one is dissatisfied with the state of things which now obtains with regard to these matters. The noble and learned Earl was good enough to appeal to me, and he asked me whether in my experience the present condition of affairs was not unsatisfactory. I answer unhesitatingly that it is most unsatisfactory, and I suppose no one passed more disagreeable quarters of an hour than I did when those cases of seizure during the. Russo-Japanese War to which reference has been made took place and we found ourselves powerless to come to the assistance of British shipowners whose vessels came under the jurisdiction I of the national Prize Courts of Russia. Therefore I for one am ready to co-operate heartily in an attempt to devise a suitable International Prize Court and to equip that Court with a suitable Code.<lb/>
But, my Lords, the question we have to answer to-night is whether these two instruments&#x2014;this Bill and the Declaration of London, which, I take it, will stand or fall by this Bill&#x2014;do furnish us with a satisfactory Court, and with a satisfactory Code. I am one of those who believe that neither of those questions can be answered in the affirmative. The Court has been so fully described that I will not repeat the descriptions which have been given of it. It is, let us remember, anything but the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0449"/>
<col>889</col>
Court that we ourselves desired to obtain. We asked for a Court consisting of three members of the Hague Tribunal, associated with two Admirals. We have obtained a Court which to many of us seems what can only be described as a fantastic Court, unduly swollen in numbers, and one upon which this country is quite inadequately represented. It is a Court constituted, as many of us think, on an altogether wrong principle&#x2014;the principle of representation of Powers rather than the principle of the selection of jurists of great eminence. I may say in passing that I derive no consolation from the Article which tells us that every member of the Court is to be a jurist of known proficiency in questions of maritime law, and of the highest moral reputation. I do not know what machinery is provided for eliminating jurists whose moral reputations may have some trifling scar or blemish.<lb/>
Then this Court is to decide in private. Secrecy is to be maintained as to its deliberations. I will not dwell upon the facilities that gives for the kind of lobbying and conspiracy which is only too likely to occur when important international cases are under discussion. What seems to us worse than all is that this Court is not only to interpret international law, but is to make international law as it goes along, so that particularly in regard to the question undealt with in the Convention of the conversion of merchantmen at sea into cruisers, we are absolutely in the hands of the Court. It is under this Court that we are asked to place the rights of all British subjects, it is to this Court that there is to be an appeal against our own Courts of Law and against our own Courts of Appeal. Can we be surprised that this proposal should be regarded with the gravest suspicion by a number of our fellow-countrymen After all, what you want in a ease of this kind is surely a Court which will inspire confidence in the minds of those who are to appear before it. What confidence is this Court likely to command?<lb/>
Then may I pass for one moment from the Court to the Code which it is to administer. This is a vital matter to this country. I take, in the first place, the question of foodstuffs. I believe it is the case that in this country before the harvest we have available about six and a-half weeks' supply of wheat; after the harvest, it rises to something like seventeen and a-half
<col>890</col>
weeks' supply. The question of foodstuffs may therefore be a matter of life and death to this country. What were the Foreign Secretary's instructions to Sir Edward Fry when he was sent as our Plenipotentiary to the Hague? He was told that it was our desire to keep in the free list foodstuffs destined for places other than beleaguered fortresses, and raw materials required for peaceful industries. That was our aspiration. We failed absolutely to get what we wanted, and we find ourselves entangled in the meshes of Articles 33 and 34 of the Declaration. What, as the Foreign Secretary very rightfully announced, we most desired was certainty in these matters. I maintain that under those two Articles we not only have not got certainty but we have uncertainty of the most perilous description. There is no certainty, there can be no certainty, under these Articles either as to the person to whom, or the port to which, foodstuffs can safely be consigned in time of war. I took note, and I am sure all the House did, of the overture which was made to us by the noble Earl opposite and repeated by my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack. I understand that what was suggested was that His Majesty's Government should undertake that Part III of this Bill should not become operative without an Order in Council, and that no Order of the kind given in Council should issue until the other Powers had accepted our definition of the ambiguous words in those two Articles&#x2014;the words "enemy," "fortified place" and "base." I welcome that proposal. I think as far as it goes it is a very excellent one. I welcome it also for this reason, that the fact that that proposal is made to us now at the eleventh hour shows that some of us were not altogether unreasonable when we insisted that the original proposals made to us were not quite satisfactory. And we are encouraged by this excellent concession to hope that with a little more insistence on our part other concessions of the same kind may yet be obtained. I do not know, and it would be interesting if the noble Earl would tell us, whether the other Powers have yet been sounded with regard to this particular suggestion, or whether it is merely one made on the responsibility of Ministers.<lb/>
But excellent as this proposal is, may I be allowed to point out that it leaves untouched our objections on the one hand to the constitution of the new Court, and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0450"/>
<col>891</col>
on the other hand to several of those points in the Declaration of London which seem to us most open to criticism. I am not at this period of the evening going to review these points at length, but let me say a word, first as to the sinking of neutral prizes. Here again the doctrine of the British Foreign Office has been clearly laid down for us. Here is what is said on the subject in the Instructions to Sir Edward Fry&#x2014;
<quote>"Great Britain has always maintained that the right to destroy is confined to enemy vessels only, and this view is favoured by other Powers. Concerning the right to destroy captured neutral vessels the view hitherto taken by the greater naval Powers has been that in the event of its being impossible to bring in a vessel for adjudication she must be released. You should urge the maintenance of the doctrine upon this subject which British Prize Courts have for at least 200 years held to be the law."</quote>
That immemorial practice of the British Prize Courts is therefore to be thrown overboard, and apparently we are to be grateful if matters are not worse. Article 49 of the Declaration expressly abandons the old practice which we have constantly maintained. And pray, let us not forget also that it is in the first instance the officer in command of the captor vessel who determines whether the conditions of Article 49 are fulfilled or not. How is the captain of a cruiser to know whether the trader to whom the goods are consigned does business with the enemy or not? How is he to know whether the port to which the vessel is bound is a base of operations or not? If the place is one of importance it is sure to be fortified. If it is not one of importance, is there any means by which the cargo of the ship can be earmarked as destined solely for the use of the civil population? When it is left to the captain of the ship to say whether by taking his prize into port he will endanger the safety of his own vessel or interfere with the success of his own operations you may be pretty sure that if he is a spirited officer he will decide the question for himself and send the prize to the bottom. This regulation seems specially disadvantageous to us, because whereas we have ports in all parts of the world and could therefore without difficulty take our prizes to them, other countries which have not the same facilities will be able to argue, and argue with a certain amount of plausibility, that, having no port nearer than, say, 1,000 miles, they are bound to destroy their prizes.<lb/>
<col>892</col>
I referred a moment ago to the conversion of merchant vessels. That is a matter with regard to which our great commercial interests are naturally much alarmed. There can be no doubt that one of these converted merchantmen, converted perhaps after she has been enjoying the hospitality of a British port, might paralyse our commerce over a great part of the high seas. I shall be told that upon this point success was unattainable. I dare say it was, but the point is distinctly a bad one for us, and so long as it remains in its present condition noble Lords opposite must not be surprised if many people look askance upon the regulation which deals with it.<lb/>
I say, therefore, that we cannot be surprised at the amount of suspicion and mistrust with which both the Bill and the Declaration so closely connected with it are regarded by the people of this country. Even His Majesty's Government are not prepared to ratify the Declaration as it stands, and are prepared to play what I suppose may be described as a waiting game. The noble and learned Earl told us that these matters required to be sifted. That is exactly our view. Further, let me assure him that nothing is further from our thoughts than to go out of our way to inflict humiliation upon His Majesty's Government&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02705"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: And upon your country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02706"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: And, <i>a fortiori,</i> upon our own country. I fail altogether to see that there is any humiliation involved in the statement of the simple fact than many of these provisions seem to those who are most concerned in them to require further consideration and discussion. The Powers are apparently, if we may infer it from what has been said by the noble Earl, ready to meet us at one point at all events. Why should it be impossible for them to meet us at other points also? We hope, on the contrary, that our action, so far from discrediting the Executive, may strengthen the hands of the Executive and enable them to renew these negotiations with a better prospect of success. And let me say again that, so far from this being, as the noble and learned Earl seemed to suppose, a mere man&#x0152;uvre instigated by certain enterprising journalists, there is really in the minds of a great many sober and thoughtful people a feeling that the change which would be brought about by the passage of this Bill and the ratification of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0451"/>
<col>893</col>
the Declaration would be a change for the worse, and that it ought certainly not to be made without that further consideration which my noble friend behind me desires to obtain" for it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02712"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is to give effect to a proposal on the part of the Belfast Corporation to increase the salaries of the resident magistrates by &#x00A3;200 a year. The present salary of &#x00A3;675 was fixed in the year 1874, but since then the population has more than doubled; and I may say, moreover, that in Dublin the resident magistrates receive &#x00A3;1,000 a year and upwards. Consequently, this seems a reasonable proposal. That is the object of Clause 1. Clause 2 provides that in future a resident magistrate of Belfast shall be either a barrister of not less than six years standing or a resident magistrate; and Clause 3 extends the jurisdiction of resident magistrates so as to enable one magistrate to be sufficient to form a quorum in dealing with Public Health Acts and other Acts. At present two magistrates are required to be present. This proposal is based upon the precedent existing in Dublin and London, and it applies to other stipendiary magistrates in England.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02723"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before your Lordships begin business I should like to say a word or two with regard to a Memorandum on the Insurance Bill for which I moved some days ago. I made that Motion with great reluctance, because I was fully aware of the amount of trouble and labour which it would throw upon members of the Civil Service, who, as we all know, in these days of long sittings have already such a very heavy burden to bear. I should not have been in the least disappointed if the noble Viscount the Leader of the House had said that in the present congested state of business he did not feel justified in granting the Return; but the Return was granted, and I think it would be ungrateful in me if I did not express to those members of the Civil Service who prepared that Report, whoever they were&#x2014;I do not know whether it was done at the Treasury or in the Government draftsmen's department, or where it was done&#x2014;my gratitude for the very great assistance which they gave to me personally, at all events, and I believe to many of your Lordships in the consideration of the Bill. I endeavoured to follow as well as I could the endless and daily alterations and changes which were made in the Bill, but. I found it impossible to keep pace with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I am bound to say that if it had not been for this Memorandum I should not have been able to arrive at a limited knowledge or at any general idea of the Bill as a whole. I merely say this because I am very sensible of the great task undertaken, for it must have involved a large amount of labour upon a staff which is already overworked, and I wish to express my gratitude to them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02994"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I move to leave out subsection (2), which is in no way relative to the Bill. This Bill is designed to promote the safety of those working in mines. The enforcement of weekly wages will have no effect in securing this desired result, but it is going to affect the relations between employers and employed. It is going to give to one of two contracting parties to a bargain the right of getting rid of their obligations and at the same time of retaining any consideration which they may have received from their employers under the original agreement. At the same time instead of promoting the safety of the workings in these mines and of the men, it will, I think, have the opposite result. In those parts of the country where wages are paid
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0461"/>
<col>913</col>
fortnightly the amount depends on the width and thickness of the seam, the width of the place worked, the accessibility and on many other factors as regards getting the coal. This entails a lot of work, which falls on certain officials. These officials at the present moment are also responsible for supervising the safety of the workings. The result will be that either these officials must be withdrawn from their more important duties of supervising the safety of the workings in order that every week they may measure the seams and make the difficult calculations on which wages are based, or else the number of officials must be increased, which would throw an extra, heavy burden on the industry. This subsection was not originally part of this Bill. It found its way into the Bill in Grand Committee. My own belief is that it was inserted ill the Bill against the wishes of His Majesty's Government. In any case this provision is strongly objected to all over the country. It is unnecessary, and it is going to upset many existing agreements and prevent new agreements being entered into between employers and employed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-02996"><member>LORD BELHAVEN AND STENTON</member><membercontribution>: I wish to add a word to what the noble Earl who has just spoken has said, for fear it might be thought that wages would only be paid once a fortnight. At all events in that portion of Scotland in which I live, the wages of the miners are made up carefully every fortnight, but in the intermediate week a lump sum is paid in advance equal to what is considered likely to be the week's wages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02997"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment which has been moved by the noble Earl raises a question which has been for many years, as your Lordships well know, a matter of great controversy. It is quite true, as the noble Earl has said, that this provision found its way into the Bill in the first instance in Grand Committee in another place, and it is quite true also that it was inserted in the Bill in Grand Committee against the wishes of the Government; but it is all the more significant that although the Government opposed the Amendment it should have been
<col>914</col>
inserted. It shows how strongly the Grand Committee were in favour of this being put into the Bill. The reason the Government opposed it was not because of any question of principle, but because they wished to confine this Bill to provisions for the health and safety of the workers in mines, and they did not wish contentious subjects dealing with other matters in regard to mining introduced into the Bill. That is the only reason why the Government opposed it.<lb/>
As this question has been raised, I think I must state with some little detail how the matter is dealt with now in different parts of the country. It is the custom at present to pay wages weekly throughout. Lancashire and Yorkshire. In the North of England and in the Midland arid Southern districts fortnightly pay has been customary for many years, and in some parts of the country, even if this provision is passed, fortnightly pay will continue to be the custom, as it meets the wishes both of employer and employed. This provision is optional to the miners. Unless the miners ask for weekly payment, weekly payment will not, be made. In Scotland in the majority of the collieries the men are paid fortnightly, but at seventy-eight collieries they are paid weekly. In South Wales wages are paid fortnightly in the majority of the collieries, but weekly at seventy-one.<lb/>
This really is a South Wales question. That is the part of the country in which it has been a burning question. And I would beg your Lordships in regard to this matter to remember that it is a burning question there. If you were to strike this provision out of the Bill at this stage I am afraid your action would be very ill received in that part of the country, which has lately been a good deal disturbed and which might very easily be disturbed again. In South Wales this is a social question. It is said that it leads to miners running into debt every week which is not the pay week. In the week in which they do not receive wages they run into debt, and that introduces a pernicious system which I think it would be very desirable to get rid of. It is argued, I know, that this change would entail in many districts an increase of the staff under ground and an increase of the clerks above ground. I am informed that in regard to South Wales there certainly is some difficulty, and there would
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0462"/>
<col>915</col>
be extra expense in arranging for the weekly payment of wages, because the rate of pay is fixed not only on the coal gotten but on the timber set, the walls built, and other things which require a good deal of measurement. But I am told that the difficulty is more apparent than real, because the officials who do the work of measurement can carry it out while making inspection of the working places, and it is really doubtful whether any increase at all would be necessary in the underground staff.<lb/>
It has been suggested that the difficulty might be met by introducing a system of "subbing"&#x2014;that is, paying on account of the wages probably earned. But there are serious difficulties in putting that into practice, and it is felt that it would really intensify the dissatisfaction rather than satisfy the men. What is required is a weekly reckoning instead of a fortnightly reckoning, and I must appeal to the noble Earl opposite not to press his Amendment. The owners are not pressing for it as a body, and in another place, although the subject had been a matter of controversy up to the Report stage and was discussed on the Report stage, no Division was taken on it on the part of those who represent the owners. I am bound to tell your Lordships also that the Government cannot accept this Amendment, and in those circumstances I beg the noble Earl not to press it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02998"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid I must beg the noble Earl to press his Amendment, and, if necessary, to carry it to a Division. This Bill seems to me to he a very curious instance of slovenly legislation. It conies up to your Lordships' House and requires no fewer than 11 pages of Amendments by His Majesty's Government in order to make it intelligible, and I think that the account we have heard of the history of this clause shows that the slovenliness has not been confined merely to drafting amendments and verbal alterations. What is it the noble Lord who has just sat down has told us. He says that the Government are not in favour of introducing this clause into the Bill at all, but that when someone carried it in Grand Committee they then gave way. Why? The noble Lord has told us that the vast majority of the country is unaffected by it, or at least does not show any desire in favour of it. The whole of the North of England and the whole of Scotland have
<col>916</col>
made no demand for it. The noble Lord says it is a burning question in South Wales. That may be an excellent reason for making an exception with regard to South Wales, and having a special clause relating to South Wales. I express no opinion whatever on that, because I do not feel qualified to do so, but I must say it is a little suspicious for His Majesty's Government to tell us that the reason they want to introduce this into South Wales is that they are afraid of more disturbances arising. In point of fact, the argument which is used in defence of this clause even in South Wales is not that it is in itself desirable to introduce it into this Bill&#x2014;because His Majesty's Government never intended it to he introduced into the Bill&#x2014;but that it is a little sop to enable the Government again to escape the performance of the duty they so ill-performed before when there were disturbances in South Wales of keeping these disturbances of trade under control. This is a matter in regard to which in the North of England the very strongest feeling is felt by the coal owners; and I do submit to your Lordships that whatever may be said for or against it in South Wales, of which I know nothing, it is a monstrous thing that such a provision should be forced upon the North of England and Scotland against their will, and where, according to the noble Lord's own confession, there is no demand for it. I trust that the noble Earl will carry this Amendment to a Division, and that your Lordships will support him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-02999"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I regret that I am unable to fall in with the views expressed by the noble Lord who introduced this Bill. The noble Duke has put before your Lordships my main reason, which is that what is applicable, perhaps, to South Wales, is not applicable to the whole country. The noble Lord went on to give another reason. He said the men run into debt. What really does happen at the present moment is that where men are paid on the last Saturday of the fortnight, 30 per cent. of those men do not turn up to work on the following Monday, and that leads to a decrease of output as regards one day in the fortnight. If this subsection is allowed to remain in, it is going to lead to double that decreased output, because it will mean that 30 per cent. of the men will not turn up on two days of the fortnight instead of on one day as at present. It may seem a very small matter that I am asking your Lordships to divide upon, but it is all
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0463"/>
<col>917</col>
part of a very large question. The coal industry has been very much hampered by recent legislation; the miners are well organised, and there really is no reason for this unnecessary interference between employers and employed. I regret that I shall have to push the matter further and ask your Lordships to divide upon the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03000"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has said that because one day's work is lost on the Monday after the fortnight's wages are paid, therefore two days would be lost if the wages are paid weekly. I think the result would probably be quite different, and that it would be very much less likely that two days will be lost. When the men are paid fortnightly the effect obviously, from what the noble Earl has said, is that these men, having a large amount of money in their pockets make use of a considerable portion of it in a way that is not wise permanently, either to themselves or to the industry in which they are engaged, and it seems to me, as far as that goes, that that is an additional argument for paying wages weekly rather than fortnightly. The only other remark that I have to make is in reference to what the noble Duke said. I think it is a little unfair on his part, after the explanation I gave of the action of the Government in another place, to still harp upon the argument that the Government were opposed to this. I repeat that the Government were only opposed because they desired to keep out of this Bill certain contentious questions which the noble Viscount opposite, Lord Chilston, knows very well are apt to creep in whenever mining questions are considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03001"><member>VISCOUNT CHILSTON</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03002"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: One of those questions is check-weighing, and another eight hours, and this not being a question directly concerned either with the health or the safety of the workers the Government were anxious to keep it out of the Bill, simply to avoid too much time being spent in the consideration of it. I therefore do not think that that ought to be used as an argument in this matter. I do not feel that I can usefully occupy your Lordships' time by further arguing this question. I have stated the case. This really is a burning question in South Wales; it is a matter about which miners feel very deeply. This provision, which the noble Earl seeks to strike out of
<col>918</col>
the Bill, is not resisted by the mine-owners as a whole, and in those circumstances, and having regard to the really difficult situation in South Wales now and recently, venture once more to make an appeal to your Lordships not to press this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03003"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am in great sympathy with the complaint which was made just now by the noble Duke on my right. I think we might well have urged that a Bill as lengthy and complicated as this is should not have been brought to us at a period of the session when it is physically impossible for us to go through it with the attention which it deserves. But your Lordships have in fact undertaken the examination of the Bill, and I am under the impression that most of your Lordships regard it as upon the whole a useful measure and desire that it should pass into law. Is it, then, really worth while for this House under these circumstances to insist upon an Amendment of this kind which deals with a point described by the noble Lord in charge of the Bill as a burning question&#x2014;I think those are the words which he used. The clause is not objected to, we understand, by a great number of the coal owners, and it is not a compulsory clause; it is only to come into operation where a majority of the men desire it. In the case where the weekly payment of wages is unmistakably desired by a large majority of the workmen, is it worth while to resist that request? I do not profess to any expert knowledge of the question, but I am bound to say that, considering all the circumstances, I hesitate to associate myself with my noble friend, and if he goes to a Division I am afraid I shall not be able to vote with him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03026"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member> moved to omit from the return to be submitted to the Home Office the requirement to show the "value at the pit mouth." The noble Earl said: The Amendment which I now move I am afraid is in Opposition to the next Amendments to be moved by the noble Lord in charge of this Bill. These returns of the value of the coal at the pit mouth are an entirely new departure. I cannot conceive with what object the Home Office are demanding this extra
<col>920</col>
information. It can do no good, and it can do a great deal of harm. Wages at present are based on the selling value of coal. Very careful calculations are made by skilled accountants and made with extreme accuracy at present, and this new demand which the Government are calling for will probably not be made up with the same care and the same accuracy as the accounts are made up on which the wages are adjusted. This return to the Government has got to be made before the 21st of January, so that there is really very little time in which to do it. But the main point is that this is a safety Bill; it is promoted with a view of securing the safety of the people who work in these mines, and I should like to know for what reason this new return is being asked. Is it being asked for with any ulterior motive as regards the further taxation of an already over-burdened industry? It all seems part of the unnecessary interference by Parliament between employers and employed, and I protest against all these things being put into a Bill which is nominally a Bill to secure the safety of the people working in the mines. I must ask the noble Lord for some reason for putting forward this new departure I see he is so enamoured of it that he is going to go three better and ask for these other returns. This has never been done before, and there can be no reason for it, unless, as I say, there is some ulterior motive in the minds of the Government.</p>

That is perfectly true, but my Amendments are practically consequential. If the value of coal is to be given at the pit mouth there is no reason why the value of these other" minerals should not also be given. The noble Earl raises a question of principle. He objects altogether to the request to give this information. With regard to the time when the information must be given, the Act does not come into force until July, and therefore there will be no hurry about providing these statistics, by the 21st of January next. That is a minor point which I think we can dismiss from our
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0465"/>
<col>921</col>
consideration. The reason these statistics are required by the Government is that every Committee and Commission which has dealt with mining statistics for many years past has recommended that this change should be made. It is quite true that one of those was a Mining Royalties Commission. I admit that. But what they say about it is this&#x2014;
<quote>"We venture to suggest that the Government should consider the advisability of reorganising and extending the Department of Mines, and that to such Department should be committed the duty of obtaining and publishing accurate information with regard to the actual price of coal at the pit's mouth."</quote>
That Commission reported in 1893. In view of that recommendation Mr. Asquith, who at that time was Home Secretary, appointed a Departmental Committee to consider the whole question of mining statistics, and as a result of their Report the statistics were reorganised to the form in which they are now issued. They recommended that the owners should be required by Statute to state the average price of coal at the pit's mouth. No opportunity occurred of giving effect to these recommendations of the Committee, and in 1905 the Royal Commission on Coal Supplies referred to the inadequacy of mining statistics and stated that had the suggestions of the Departmental Committee been carried out it would have greatly assisted their inquiries. Certain statistics are published, as we know, but the information is incomplete, and the passing of the Census of Production Act has made the case for the publication of these statistics very much stronger. Under that Act the Board of Trade will collect, at intervals of probably not less than five years, information on this very point, and I think in the general interests of the country it is important that these statistics, instead of being obtained every five years, should be obtained every year. I repeat that this precise course has been recommended by every Commission and Committee that has dealt, with mining statistics during the last twenty years, and that is the reason why His Majesty's Government ask that this should remain in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03029"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: What this is going to lead to is that if there is any discrepancy between the figures, which doubtless there may be, that are returned to the Home Office and the figures pre-

sented by the accountants on which the manager of the mine bases the wages of the men, it will tend to promote an idea in the minds of the men that their employers have deliberately faked the figures, if may use the expression, in order to lower their wages. There have been enough difficulties between employers and employed in the past without creating fresh embarrassments. I am not going to trouble your Lordships by asking you to divide on this point, but I do protest against all this unnecessary legislation finding its way into this Bill. As far as I can see, the only argument which the noble Lord used was that the Government officials have intimated that it would be wise to have these returns. It seems to me that this vast number of Government officials, of whom there has been such a tremendous increase during the administration of His Majesty's Government, have not enough to do, and that these returns have been called for merely with a view of giving them some employment.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03066">(5) If and when the Chairman is temporarily unable to attend, or his office is vacant, the Secretary for Scotland may appoint to act temporarily in his place any person having the qualification required for holding the office of Chairman and the person so appointed shall, during such inability or vacancy, have the same powers and perform the same duties as if he were the Chairman.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03067">(6) The Secretary four Scotland shall front time to time appoint a fit person to act as principal clerk to the Land Court.</p>
<col>924</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03068">(7) The Land Court may appoint or employ such assessors, surveyors, law agents, valuers, clerks, messengers, and other persons required for the due performance of their duties, as the Treasury, on the recommendation of the Secretary for Scotland, may sanction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03069">(8) Any Crofters Commissioner or officer of the Crofters Commission in office at the commencement of this Act, who may not be appointed a member or an officer of the Land Court, shall receive such compensation as the Treasury may determine.</p>

other night, that the House is entitled to some explanation from the noble Lord</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03080"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord raised this point in Committee, and I promised to do my best to consider it and look up the precedents. I have done that, and I find that the nearest precedent is the Act to which I referred&#x2014;Section 41 of the Irish Act of 1881. That Act alludes to rank and tenure, salary and pension, and retiring allowance, I think it is called. I have also considered the noble Lord's criticism on the special question of rank. It is quite true, as he urged, that precedence is settled, not necessarily by Act of Parliament, but by His Majesty, and that, of course, would be the intention. We should follow any necessary change in the order of precedence which may be due to the creation of this new office. At the same time it did not seem to be sufficiently clear with the word "rank" omitted from this Bill, and therefore I have ventured to move it in so that if the House, on consideration, is willing to retain it, it can be retained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03081"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Is the noble Lord prepared to state the name of the Chairman?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03082"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Yes; but perhaps it would be convenient to finish this discussion first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03083"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is not following the precedent which he himself quoted. He is giving the Chairman the rank and tenure of a Judge of the Court of Session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03084"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: But not the salary and pension. It is quite true that we do not give him the salary, but if the noble Lord will look at the fifth line on page four of the Bill he will see that he is given a retiring annuity proportionate to his salary subject to the like conditions and incidents as if he had been appointed a Judge of the Court of Session. His salary will be calculated according to the same scale.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03085"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: If these changes were to have been made at all, they ought to have been made in the
<col>926</col>
other House of Parliament; but I shall not press the matter to a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03086">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03087"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I move, after "Court" in subsection (4), to insert "other than the Chairman." Perhaps it would be convenient here that I should communicate to the House the name of the gentleman to whom we propose to offer the appointment of Chairman of this Land Court. His name is Mr. Neil Kennedy. I will give the House the particulars of his career. He was called to the Bar in the year 1877, and, after filling various positions, including that of Lecturer on Private International Law in Edinburgh University, in the year 1898, and the Professorship of Civil and Scots Law in the University of Aberdeen from the year 1901 to the year 1907, was appointed in the year 1907 a member of the Royal Commission on the Registration of Titles, and also in that same year he was appointed Sheriff of Renfrew and Bute. In 1908, on the death of Sir David Brand, he was appointed Chairman of the Crofters Commission. I am informed, and I think I can rely on the information placed before me, that Mr. Kennedy is distinguished for his independence of mind, his wide learning, and his legal eminence. He is second to nobody in his profession in his acquaintance with this particular branch of law, and his experience of nearly four years as Chairman of the Crofters Commission has given him a practical knowledge of a very unique description. His work as Chairman of the Crofters Commission has not only given general satisfaction, but has, I think, enhanced his reputation in his profession. He is a man whose standing in his profession would justify&#x2014;and whom, I think, his professional brethren would regard of the necessary standing and eminence&#x2014;his appointment to the position even of a Judge of the Court of Session, the attributes of which office we have just been considering. For these reasons, the Government consider that he is pre-eminently the man fitted to discharge successfully the duties of this new office, bearing in mind not only his personal qualities but the <i>status</i> and dignity of the Court over which he will preside. I may mention that in the year 1895 Mr. Kennedy contested Inverness-shire in the Liberal interest, but, as noble Lords from Scotland well know, most advocates of standing on one side or the other of politics go through the same experience.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03091" align="center"><i>Constitution of Board of Agriculture for Scotland.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03092"><b>4.</b>&#x2014;(1) It shall be lawful for His Majesty on the recommendation of the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, at any time after the commencement of this Act, and from time to time as vacancies occur, to appoint not more than three persons to be designated the Scottish Department of Agriculture for Scotland (in this Act referred to as the Department) and to appoint one of such persons to be Chairman of the Department. Any act or thing required or authorised to be done by the Department may be done by any one or more of the members thereof as the President may from time to time direct.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03093">(2) The Department shall be charged with the general duty of promoting the interests of agriculture, forestry, and other rural industries in Scotland, and shall also exercise and perform any powers and duties which are or may be conferred on or transferred to them under the provisions of this Act. In the discharge of their duties they shall comply with such instructions or regulations as may from time to time be issued by the President, and they shall submit an annual report of their proceedings to him, which report shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03094">(3) The Department may undertake the collection and preparation of statistics relating to agriculture, forestry, and other rural industries, and may make or aid in making such inquiries, experiments, and research, and collect or aid in collecting such information relating thereto as they think advisable.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03099">(8) The members of the Department shall hold office during His Majesty's pleasure. The Department may, subject to the approval of the President, appoint or employ such officers, clerks, and other persons as the Treasury may sanction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03100">(9) The members of the Department and other persons appointed or employed under this section shall respectively receive such salary or remuneration as the Treasury may sanction, and all such salaries or remuneration and the expenses of the Department incurred in the execution of their duties, to such amount as may be sanctioned by the Treasury, shall be paid out of moneys provided by Parliament.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03108"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: This, again, is a reversal of what was done on a previous stage of the Bill in this House, and I think, if there has been any general arrangement made, we are entitled to some sort of statement with regard to it, especially as this matter bears very strongly on the important question of the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act. I think the noble Lord, before he asks us to go back on a decision already come to, should give us some reason for it.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0469"/>
<col>929</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03109"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will remember the discussion which we had upon this subject on the Committee stage of the Bill, and it would not, I think, be agreeable, or to your convenience, that I should repeat the general arguments I then urged in favour of the course which the Government have proposed in this matter. I then had the honour of stating plainly to the House that the Government consider this vital to the Bill&#x2014;that is to say, the retention of their scheme of establishing a separate Board of Agriculture in Scotland for the purposes named in the Bill. Objection was taken to that course, and your Lordships inserted a series of Amendments which entirely destroyed the machinery of the Bill on the one hand, and on the other failed to insert in the Bill any co-ordinated scheme in its place. Under these circumstances I felt that it would only be right to place this Amendment upon the Paper so that the House might have an opportunity of reconsidering their attitude, especially in the light of what I am now prepared to state in regard to the most controversial part of the proposals&#x2014;namely, the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act. Your Lordships will recollect that a debate took place especially on that point, that I then stated in regard to that subject that I recognised the strength of opinion of this House in favour of the retention of that administration by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and that I also undertook to represent to my colleagues the opinion which had been expressed here in that sense. Since then I have discharged those undertakings; and while the Government still recognise the force of the arguments on account of which they inserted in the Bill this provision for the transfer of the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act to Scotland&#x2014;while the reasons seem to us as cogent as they ever were for this transfer, still we recognise that this House is strongly against such a proposal, and therefore I shall not oppose the retention of those particular powers by the Board in London. I hope&#x2014;and I think the discussion which took place last week affords some grounds for hoping&#x2014;that as these administrative powers with regard to diseases of animals are to be retained in London, your Lordships may be agreeable to accept the remainder of the proposals of the Government in regard to the setting up of a separate Board of Agriculture in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<col>930</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03110"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: On that, I must ask this question before deciding whether or not to press our opposition to a Division. Are we to understand that the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act will be retained in the power of the Board of Agriculture in London, and will not be removable except by an amending Statute&#x2014;by all Act of Parliament?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03111"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03112"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: And that there will be no proposal to transfer the powers either by Orders in Council or in any other way except by an amending statutory enactment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03113"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: That is clear on the face of the proposals, and further than that I propose not to oppose the Amendment which is to be moved by my noble friend Lord Burghclere on this point, which makes it clear that except by Parliamentary enactment such a transfer cannot take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03114"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord did not say that he was going to accept the Amendment, and even now he does not say whether he is going to support it with all the force of the Government in another place. I think we must clearly understand where we are. So far as I am concerned&#x2014;I say it deliberately, having carefully thought it over&#x2014;before I personally will consent to the transfer of the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act to any authority other than the Imperial authority, I would prefer to lose the Bill; and I want to know whether, if we give way now, we are likely to be told afterwards that we have given way once and for all and have sunk our opinions on this important matter. I frankly say to the noble Lord that if he had not met us thus far I should have opposed the Amendment which he is now making, and so kept the whole administration of agriculture under the Board of Agriculture in London. I still think that best in the interests of agriculture, not only of Scotland but of the whole of Great Britain. The noble Lord said he observed that the House had formed a strong opinion on this matter. I beg him to note that this House is of that opinion, not from any selfish reason of its own, but because the members of the House believe that in that
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0470"/>
<col>931</col>
they are voicing the opinions of the agricultural community of Scotland. There is no sort of proof that has been given to the contrary.<lb/>
I notice that the noble Lord received a deputation the other day from an important society in the South-west of Scotland who had passed a resolution agreeing not to the proposal in the Bill, but to the proposal for a separate Department of Agriculture with a Minister responsible for it. A correspondent has supplied me with a little information about that resolution. It was passed at an annual meeting of the association, but on the notice paper calling the meeting there was not given the slightest indication that any such resolution was to be proposed, so that those who were opposed to it in the society not only were ignorant of the fact that such a resolution was going to be proposed, but they had not the opportunity of expressing their opinions about it. What value a resolution passed under those circumstances can be I am at a loss to imagine. I hold in my hand a copy of the notice calling the meeting, and there is no doubt whatever that upon it there is no indication of any kind that such a resolution was going to be proposed.<lb/>
I deeply regret that for the first time the interests of agriculture in Scotland are to be separated from those in England. Like the noble Lord, I am not going over the reasons which I gave for holding that opinion. We do not want a revised debate on this occasion. I only say that my opinions on the merits of the question are absolutely unchanged, and if I could have enforced my view I should have endeavoured to do it. The noble Lord knows that why it cannot be done is that by the structure of the Bill and its financial provisions the whole of the money left in the hands of the Congested Districts Board is transferred to the new Board of Agriculture&#x2014;I do not know whether we have any power over that or not&#x2014;and I dare say questions of privilege might be raised in another place if we attempted to deal with it. So far as I am concerned, I think that if there had been any intention at all of meeting our views the matter could have been adjusted in another place. The noble Lord has said over and over again that in his opinion this matter is vital to the Bill, and therefore we cannot expect him to give us any assistance.<lb/>
<col>932</col>
I say again that, so far as I am personally concerned, if it had been intended to do anything to pave the way for transferring the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act to this new Department which is being established, I should have preferred to lose the Bill. I repeat that this is contrary to the wish of all the best agricultural opinion in Scotland. I believe it to be contrary to their interest, and although it is not altogether wise to prophesy until you know, I prophesy with the utmost confidence that in the course of a very few years the best agricultural opinion in Scotland will continue deeply to regret this change. I can only record my opinion; but having the assurance of the noble Lord that the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act is to be left with the existing Department and only to be transferable by actual legislation, I have nothing more to say, and I shall not oppose the Amendment which the noble Lord now moves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03115"><member>LORD BURGHCLERE</member><membercontribution>: I ventured on a previous occasion to trouble your Lordships at such considerable length on the question of the transference of these powers to a Scottish Board of Agriculture that if I were to repeat my arguments now it would simply be an outrage upon the House. I merely rise to say that I have heard with the deepest satisfaction the statement of my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland. I gather from his remarks that he is prepared to accept the Amendment which stands in my name to his own Amendment, and that the Government are also prepared to accept that Amendment when it goes to the Lower House of Parliament. Under these circumstances I rejoice very much that my noble friend opposite has withdrawn his opposition, and I am quite certain that not only agriculturists in Scotland but in England also will rejoice to hear the decision of the Government on this question. I would say that I myself, sitting as I do on this side of the House and anxious as I am to support my noble friend with his Bill, agree with the weighty words used by my noble friend Lord Balfour to-day, and those used the other day by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn; and if the Government had insisted upon transferring these powers to a Scottish Board of Agriculture and doing away with the central control which has done so much for agriculture in Great Britain, I for my part would have opposed
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0471"/>
<col>933</col>
it even if it brought about the destruction of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03116"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Lord Balfour has announced his intention not to oppose this Amendment, and I think it only right that I should point out that this concession on his part is a very great concession, and that it proceeds not only from him but from this side of the House generally. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland announced to us the other Clay, and he has repeated it to-night, that he regarded this matter as vital to the Bill. Your Lordships have given way upon it, and I merely wish to impress upon him that this is a very great concession on our part, because there are other matters which are equally vital to the Bill and which very likely will come up hereafter, and I would ask the noble Lord to keep this in his mind when those matters come to be dealt with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03117"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I merely desire to say that I entirely agree in principle with the proposal which was submitted to the House by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh. I believe the course which he recommended was the proper and logical course to take. In my view, the administration of the whole of the agriculture of the United Kingdom ought properly to be left under the Board of Agriculture in this city. To my mind the attempt to distinguish in this way between Scottish agriculture and British agriculture is most unwise and likely to involve the country in very serious risks. But it has been made clear to us that there is no prospect of obtaining from His Majesty's Government the kind of settlement that we desire. I am therefore grateful to them for having met us at any rate to the extent of dealing in a proper manner with the question of the administration of the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act. By reserving that and making that a matter of national concern and not purely of local concern, something, at any rate, has been done to save the agricultural community from a risk which might have led to the most fatal results.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03118"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: As this is a matter which affects England also, I think it would be more satisfactory to this House if we could have an assurance from the noble Lord that if the Amendment referred

I propose to acid, at the end of the new subsection which my noble friend has just inserted in the Bill, the words" or any powers or duties exercisable under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, or any enactment amending or extending the same. "If those words are added to the Bill I am informed, and my opinion is confirmed by the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, that it will not be possible for the Secretary for Scotland or the Government of the day to transfer under
<col>936</col>
this Bill, as was originally proposed, the administration of the Contagious Diseases of Animals Act to a separate Board in Scotland, and that no such step can be taken by them afterwards except by legislation. I think my Amendment makes the position we arrived at in Committee stage absolutely safe, and I am certain that when the agriculturists of England and Scotland become aware of what the Government have done they will be very thankful for the concession which has been made. I have not the slightest doubt myself, and I never had any doubt, that if the Bill stood as it was originally introduced and these powers had been transferred to a Scottish Board&#x2014;if the control of these important Acts were taken away from the central authority at present established in London, I am certain it would have been a great disadvantage to our agriculturists and especially our breeders of stock. It is the success of the Central Board in Great Britain which has given confidence to stock breeders all over the country. It has done more than that; it has given confidence in those foreign countries to which at the present moment we export our prize cattle. It is not a very large export trade, but it is an increasing one especially to Argentina, and I am quite certain that if this proposition had been retained in the Bill as it originally stood it would have shaken the confidence of those cattle dealers in foreign ports who buy our cattle, and would have dealt a very serious blow and proved a hindrance to our export trade. I cannot sit down without saying how grateful I am to my noble friend and the Government for their acceptance of this Amendment, which I am certain will be very acceptable to all agriculturists in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>

<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) in respect of any land being or forming part of a farm not exceeding one hundred and fifty acres or if exceeding one hundred and fifty acres or of an annual value as entered in the valuation roll not exceeding eighty pounds occupied by a person who has no personal interest in any other farm: Provided that nothing herein contained shall operate to prevent the registration otherwise than by agreement of two or more new holders in respect of the whole of such farm, not being a farm wholly or mainly pastoral, where no other land is available in the neighbourhood of any existing village or township; or</li>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03184"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I should like to remind your Lordships that when I first moved my Amendment in Committee I asked for something more than the noble Lord finally agreed to accept. I asked that farms should be protected which exceeded 150 acres and which did not exceed an annual value of &#x00A3;100. On the request of the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland I agreed to his suggestion that I should alter the &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;80 of I annual value. Now, however, I am asked to accept some further whittling down, and to accept the definition of a farm as one that is "wholly or mainly pastoral." I am not going to raise any objection to it, because, as the noble Lord perfectly rightly says, it meets the main point with regard to these farms that have a small amount of arable land and a considerable amount of pasture, the farm consequently being of a large acreage but held at a low rental. The Amendment even as altered still meets my point, and I do not, therefore, propose to take objection to what the noble Lord proposes.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03252"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member> moved to omit from the proviso in subsection (2) the words "may if they think fit, and." The noble Lord said: Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to make a slight explanation here. This Amendment and the other Amendments all go together. This clause gives power to the Land Court to state a special case on questions of law to a higher Court, and that discretion to state a special case as it stands in the Bill is guarded by this qualification, that they may refuse to state such a case if they consider it frivolous or vexatious. The noble Viscount opposite (Lord St. Aldwyn) suggests that that discretion which in the Bill is left with the Land Court should be handed over to a Judge of the Court of Session, and he has on the Paper an Amendment to insert in
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0476"/>
<col>943</col>
the clause words to the effect that the Land Court shall, on the request of any party, if a Judge of the Court of Session certifies that such request is not frivolous or vexatious, state a case. The Government prefer the Bill as it stands and take objection to the suggestion of the noble Viscount, but in order to meet him, if he really feels bound to press the point, which I trust he will not do, the Government would offer him as an alternative the omission of the words "unless they consider such a request frivolous or vexatious," as they would much rather have it mandatory on the Land Court to state a case on the request of the parties, leaving the parties themselves to bear any responsibility which may attach to them for having a case stated under circumstances which are frivolous or vexatious.</p>

Contempt may be either direct, as; in the case of disobedience of the orders I or insult to the person of the Judge, or indirect by other acts calculated to impede or prevent the due administration of justice.

<col>947</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03286"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: It is rather a technical matter. As the Bill was first introduced it was provided that a person should not be held to be an existing yearly tenant or a qualified leaseholder in respect of&#x2014;and then followed the words "any land that is not either wholly agricultural or wholly pastoral or in part agricultural and as to the residue pastoral." That was the earlier form of paragraph (<i>f</i>). It was felt that those words were not quite satisfactory, and the words in paragraph (<i>f</i>) as it now stands were accordingly substituted. The definition of a holding in the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1908 is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"' Holding' means any piece of land held by a tenant, which is either wholly agricultural or wholly pastoral, or in part agricultural and as to the residue pastoral, or in whole or in part cultivated as a market garden, and which is not let to the tenant during his continuance in any office, appointment, or employment held under the landlord."</quote>
We can ignore market gardens, because they are safeguarded specially, and we can ignore service holdings because they are also dealt with specially under the Bill. The real substance of this matter is this. It is, of course, obvious that new holdings may be constituted out of pieces of land not held by separate tenants hitherto. The intention of altering paragraph (<i>f</i>) is simply to make it clear that new holdings are to be agricultural or pastoral or both. As it stands it is possibly not so clear as it might be, and for that reason it is proposed to insert the Amendment which I have to put down at the end of sub section (4), simply applying paragraph (<i>f</i>) in words rather than by reference. I hope the House will see fit to follow that suggestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03287"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: Is there any real advantage to anyone in leaving paragraph (<i>f</i>) in the clause at all, because you have already taken out of it under a former subsection the part which relates to market gardening. You have also taken out of it, under subsection (7), that part which relates to service occupation, and you leave nothing at all except the ordinary holding which is either wholly agricultural or wholly pastoral or part agricultural and part pastoral, or whatever it may be. Subsection (7), of course, applies to the whole of those as far as existing tenants are concerned. You yourselves apply it in subsection (4) to be taken for new
<col>948</col>
holdings, and it seems to me that the addition of those particular words at the end of subsection (4) accomplish the whole object which you can possibly gain by leaving paragraph (<i>f</i>) in the clause as it stands.

This Amendment has very much the same object as the noble Lord's Amendment, but, if he will allow me to say so, I think it meets the case better than his Amendment does. The noble Lord has endeavoured to remove a grievous injustice, by which for insufficient cause a tenant may be removed from the position of a statutory small tenant to that of a landholder. As the clause stood it was, if I may say so, putting almost a premium on blackmail, because a tenant stood in the
<col>954</col>
position of, "Heads I win; tails you lose." He had only to propose to the landlord any permanent improvement which he deemed necessary, and if the landlord refused the tenant could say, "Very well, I will take you to the Court. If I do not succeed, affairs will remain as they are; but if I do succeed I shall be transferred from a statutory small tenant to a landholder." This is a grievous injustice, and I am glad to see that the noble Lord has recognised it and attempted to remedy it, but he leaves the matter to the discretion | of the Court. He says the Court may, if they think proper, give the landlord an opportunity of remedying his failure as aforesaid. Take this case. A statutory tenant is in possession of a farm in which all the improvements have been made by the landlord, and he thinks a certain improvement is necessary. The landlord disagrees and the tenant refers to the Land Court, who may say it is necessary and may declare that the tenant shall become a landholder. Why they should be able to penalise the landlord, if they think fit, by transferring the tenant to the category of a landholder where he would have the various advantages which are only supposed to be granted to a tenant who has made all the improvements himself, I cannot make out. I should be quite prepared to accept the Amendment of the noble Lord and to withdraw mine when the proper time comes if he could see his way to omit the words "if they think proper." I confess I have not the same confidence in the Court as the noble Lord possesses, and if those words still remain in I hope the House will think that the noble Lord's Amendment ought to be rejected and mine inserted instead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03354"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: It really is a substantial suggestion which the noble Lord has just put forward, because if the Court finds that a particular alteration is necessary and the landlord fails to carry it out, the tenant thereupon becomes a new landholder. Surely the option given by the words "if they think proper" is not one which ought to be given to the Court. Take the case of an insanitary dwelling. The sanitary authority says, "You must put your dwelling right; you must remedy these defects within a certain time." That is all that is proposed here. But as the Bill stands it would run thus," Your dwelling is insanitary, and therefore it is to be taken away from you unless
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0482"/>
<col>955</col>
you do so and so." I think that the proposal of the noble Lord is quite right that the words" if they think proper" should be omitted. Such a discretion ought not to be left to the Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03355"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think we are looking at this from a little different point of view. The Land Court has no interest in making a statutory small tenant into a landholder at all. The position is really this, according to the clause either the statutory small tenant or the landlord may go to the Court&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03356"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I am not objecting to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03357"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: They may go to the Court and say, "Here are some improvements which should be made," and as the clause was originally drawn the Court had to hear the parties. What the noble Lord wants is that there should be a full opportunity for the landlord to remedy any omissions on his part. As I am advised, as the clause was originally drawn that discretion lies with the Court. Any Court can adjourn its proceedings for any length of time; it has full power to do so, and it was amply in their discretion to make such an adjournment in order to bring the parties together. Lord Oranmore on the last occasion proposed an Amendment which insisted on an obligatory six months elapsing. I took objection to that, and pointed out that it might not be to the interest of the landlord himself that that six months should elapse. The landlord might be glad to get rid of the responsibility with regard to the holding, and I would submit to your Lordships that the Amendment I have put down meets every possible contingency. It might be a great hardship to a landlord to remain saddled with a holding and the responsibility for improvements which he does not wish to carry out. I think at the root of the noble Lord's Amendment is the idea that it matters to the Land Court in which category the tenant lies. It does not matter in the least to them. We have considered this with a desire to do justice to both sides, and I think the words I have suggested carry out that object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03358"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord tells us that under the Bill as originally drawn the Court would have had discretion to give the landlord power to remedy any omission

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03359"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: My objection was that the noble Lord's Amendment obliged the landlord to wait six months before anything could be done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03361"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: While the noble Lord is quite right in objecting to the six months, I would point out that the discretion still remains with the Land Court as to whether j they shall give the landlord time or not as long as you keep in the words "if they think proper." I thoroughly agree with the proposal of the noble Lord, and if he would cut out the words" if they think proper" I personally would have no further objection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03362"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Is it not possible to find some words which I will meet the point taken by my noble friends, because there really is a point which has to be met? The noble Lord in charge of the Bill said just now that the Land Court had no interest in converting a statutory small tenant into a landholder. That may be quite true, but surely under the Bill the Land Court will be compelled to convert him into a landholder if the Court finds that there have been laches on the part of the landlord and that he has failed to make those improvements in the equipment of the holding which the Court deems to be necessary. My noble friend's point is a very simple one. The Court finds, for example, that the erection of an out-building is necessary. Let the landlord be given an opportunity of putting up that building, and there is an end of everything. Surely that is a perfectly reasonable proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03363"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Marquess leaves out of consideration that this is the last step, possibly, in the whole series of negotiations. The tenant or the landlord will not go to the Land Court until they have exhausted all other remedies. They are sitting under an agreement which they themselves have come to. The tenant is selected by the landlord and continued by the landlord, and he is sitting under the agreement that has been made. It is only,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0483"/>
<col>957</col>
I think, as the last resource that they will come before the Land Court, and, as Lord Clinton pointed out, it is in the discretion of the Land Court after they have heard the parties to take any action they like. They may dismiss it or adjourn it. They are not obliged to "so find and declare." The words are "if they shall so find and declare." It is in the discretion of the Court whether they shall so find and declare, and in that case the tenant and the landlord would be free to go on under the existing circumstances, or under the new circumstances which may have been brought about by an application to the Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03364"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Take a case where the landlord and the tenant fail to agree as to the addition of this particular out-building. The parties then go to the Court, and the Court finds that the out-building ought to be erected. All we say is, lot the landlord have an opportunity of complying with the requirements of the Court and of putting up the building and continuing the tenant as a statutory small holder, instead of having him converted over his head into a landholder.</membercontribution></p>

It is a very unusual thing to ask the House to sit twice on one day, and it is not very easy suddenly the night before to free oneself from engagements. I do not suppose I am saying anything that ought not to be mentioned, but I understand that an Amendment is likely to be suggested which might have an important bearing upon some consequential Amendments in which I am very much interested to the old Clause 32, now Clause 31, and I think it would greatly facilitate matters if we had some information from the Secretary for Scotland as to the course he is likely to pursue.</membercontribution></p>

It is perfectly obvious to me that no real representation of the House will come down at noon, and supposing we do not agree and have to go to a Division, the very small number present will hardly show the fair general sense of the House. The noble Lord will understand that I am anxious that no difficulty should be raised which is not absolutely necessary, but I point out that we may be placed in very great difficulty if we do not agree, because there may be a Division and then the thing would have to stand over until another day.

I should be quite willing to fall in with it myself, but if the suggestion is not practicable I really hope that there may be nothing for us to disagree strongly about to-morrow, and possibly even if that were to take place we might be able to adjourn the House for an hour or two in order to meet the convenience of noble Lords.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03418">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03419"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: This is a Bill which I do not anticipate will arouse any controversy in this House. According to its title, its simple purpose is to amend the Burgh Police (Scotland) Acts in order to provide for the further regulation of places for public refreshment in Scotland. By these are meant temperance refreshment houses. The Burgh Police Act of 1892 prohibits such refreshment houses from opening between 12 midnight and 5 a.m., but at all other hours of the day or night they may remain open. This power was not found to be sufficient for their regulation, especially for the purpose of regulating what are known as ice-cream shops and aerated water shops, and in 1903 an amending Act was passed to regulate
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0486"/>
<col>963</col>
these shops and to place them under the control of the magistrates. This Act of 1903 has been found to be practically inoperative for the reason that the Courts have held that an ice-cream shop or an aerated water shop is a shop which sells only ice-cream or only aerated waters or mainly such things, and a great many of these shops, probably all of them, sell other things as well. Thus the operation of the Act has been nullified, for it has in practice been confined to a class of shop which is really not to be found anywhere. It is, therefore, the case that this method of dealing with this evil has broken down, and at the instance of a very strong and active public opinion in Scotland this Bill is brought forward to remedy the defect. It brings within its scope, as noble Lords will see if they look at the Bill, all refreshment places, not only ice-cream shops and aerated water shops but also all temperance refreshment houses.<lb/>
The dilemma which we have to meet is either to allow the particular shops of which complaint is made to remain, altogether unregulated, or else to attempt to regulate all temperance refreshment houses. It may be argued that this is hard upon houses of which no complaint is made, but, on the other hand, I think it may fairly be said that with the discretion which is allowed to the magistrates by the provisions of this Bill there is really no great hardship in adopting the rule that all temperance refreshment places should close at 10 o'clock at night. The procedure of the Bill is to set up a register which will contain the names of all refreshment traders who carry on business after 8 o'clock at night and who open for the convenience of working men and other people before 5 o'clock in the morning. The register will also contain the names of all refreshment traders who carry on business on Sundays. All the people: placed on this register will come under: the superintendence of the local authority, and the Bill gives to the local authority power to inspect at all hours, and also a very important power in this particular matter&#x2014;a power to regulate the internal I construction and, as I have proposed by an Amendment, the lighting of these shop premises. The local authority has the further power of removing a house from the register for an offence. Under that provision&#x2014;that is, for an offence&#x2014;a single shop can be shut up.<lb/>
<col>964</col>
On the other hand, to provide for the convenience of the public there, are special powers under the Bill to grant to any refreshment traders special permission to remain open for special hours, and there is also power given to the local authority to make by-laws providing for the special benefit, not of individual houses, but of houses in selected areas, in order to meet the public convenience. I should imagine those places would be near places of amusement and railway stations. That is really the whole extent of the Bill. It is designed to meet the convenience of the public and I also particularly to provide for the protection of young people who frequent these houses. It has passed through the other House of Parliament, and on all sides there I has been great friendliness to its purpose and j provisions, and I commend it to the favourable consideration of your Lordships' House. I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

I do not propose to criticise the Bill in any way, but I should like to call the attention of the noble Lord I to Clause 2. It seems to me that the powers there given are a little too great, and might be very easily abused. I noticed that the noble Lord in speaking of the Bill used the word'' magistrate." Now, Clause 2 says that on the representation of two members&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03423"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: Under the clause two members of a town council of a burgh may give permission to keep open. It seems to me that that provision is a little wide. We know what town councillors are in small burghs in Scotland. Practically, it seems to me, bribery might be used, or different means to get round a gentleman might be easily used in order to get him to agree to allow a particular place to be kept open. I suggest that it would save a lot of trouble if the noble Lord would accept an Amendment making it, instead of two members, two magistrates. Naturally that would include some of the older town councillors who are appointed magistrates,

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03451"><member>THE EAEL OF DUNMORE</member> moved the insertion of a new subsection to provide that "The owner of a small dwelling-house shall at the commencement of the occupancy of each occupier and in each year beginning on the fifteenth day of May deliver to such occupier a statement specifying the respective amounts of rent and of assessments payable by him in respect of the period of his occupancy, and the owner in the receipts for such payments by the occupier shall specify the respective amounts paid for rent and for assessments." The noble Earl said: I think the object of my Amendment is pretty clear. In putting it forward I am admitting the difficulty which arises in collecting the rates in the case of short lets unless they are collected through the landlord. But in admitting this, I am not in any way admitting the necessity of continuing, or developing or extending, as this Bill does, the evils which go together with compounding. The evils of compounding have been so often discussed in your Lordships' House that it is unnecessary for me to go into them. They are admitted, I think, on both sides of this House. The difficulty one is faced with in trying to abolish compounding is the loss to the rates from defaulters unless you collect the rates through the landlord. I hope. I may say that my Amendment contains all the virtues, if there are any, and none of the vices of compounding. It leaves the landlord in the position of collecting the rates lie is responsible for collecting them, but at the same time there is brought home to the ratepayer the fact that he is a ratepayer, and the amount which he is paying in rates is made quite clear. In this way the ratepayer would have brought home to him his personal responsibility as a ratepayer for the economical administration of his district. I am sure the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland is as anxious as we are on this side of the House to obtain sound and economical administration, but you will never get that as long as ratepayers are unaware they pay rates. It is a wrong system, and in my opinion it is responsible for a great deal of that rapid increase of local expenditure which a few years ago
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0490"/>
<col>971</col>
was about half of, and is now, I think, about equal to or greater than, our Imperial expenditure. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03453"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I will not differ from the noble Earl on the principle of the desirability of impressing upon every ratepayer the amount which he pays in rates. But while I freely admit the strength of his contention, I am sorry it is not possible to accept the Amendment which he proposes. This Bill is, as I am sure he is aware, promoted on the footing that the occupier pays to the owner rates and rent in one indivisible sum, and if the noble Earl will reflect he will see it is really not possible to specify beforehand the amount of rates payable by the occupier. It must begin on a system of short lets, but the period of occupancy is not defined; and it is not possible, as I say, to specify the amount payable beforehand by the occupier. And further, for some months after the l5th of May, while the rate is being prepared and struck&#x2014;that is to say, during the whole period from May until November or December, when the rate notices are sent out&#x2014;it is not possible to say exactly what the oceupier's share of rates is. We got over the difficulty under our former proposals by calculating upon the payments made in previous months. But that Bill was entirely different; and it would be inconsistent with this Bill as it now stands to introduce any such provision as the noble Earl desires.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03454"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I have heard the noble Lord's answer with extreme regret. I cannot conceive anything worse, as an economical proposition, than mixing up rates and rent together. The rates increase, and the amount of money which the unfortunate landlord puts into his pocket decreases, while the gross amount which the tenant pays to
<col>972</col>
him increases. That is, in the first place, an injustice to the individual, because he is thought to be a grasping landlord when he is actually losing money as compared with previous years. But an injustice to an individual, especially to a landlord, I probably will not appeal very greatly to some noble Lords on the other side of the House. But what is more unfortunate is that the person who votes, who practically decrees the expenditure, who elects the body which spends the money, is left absolutely in ignorance of the effect of his voting. I frankly admit there is a difficulty in respect of that, because I suppose this Bill will extend over other houses which are let from May to May, whereas it is perfectly well known to all of us who are accustomed to work under the local system in Scotland that the rates are not struck until September, and they are not paid until January, and even sometimes February, the last day for payment without penalty being, I believe, at the end of February. But it is really very unfortunate, because this is a retrograde step in these days when compounding has been much more the custom in England than it has been in Scotland. It has been our privilege in Scotland, except in houses under &#x00A3;4, to have no compounding at all, and it is most lamentable to me to see this system brought in with all its disadvantages. I know from inquiries upon the Local Taxation Commission that there are many of these who, for certain franchise purposes, do compound, and the compounding householder is a time-honoured institution. There has been a benefit also on account of the convenience of collecting the rates from the landlord. But there is a vicious system in connection with this in England by which the landlord gets a discount for collecting the rates. I do not know how much it is, but it is very hard on the other ratepayers. I am glad for the landlord, but I do not know about the local authorities. However, in this case, so far as I know, no discount is allowed to the landlord. I will support the Amendment; but I am not one of those who are in any way responsible for the bringing in of this most atrocious system.</membercontribution></p>

Under this Bill, without such a clause as this, I think it probable that they would not be able to continue that practice, but the owner would be required, in the first instance at all events, to squeeze these unfortunate people and attempt to get the rates out of them. Although in all probability he would not succeed, at all events the authority would be deprived of the power which it has, or claims to have, of exemption. Therefore I propose to insert this clause to say that they shall not be deprived of the power.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03479"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member> rose "To ask the Secretary of State for War when it was decided by the Army Council that there should be a peace establishment as well as a war establishment for the Territorial Force; and, if the peace establishment is 250,000 men, why County Associations have been continuously urged to raise in time of peace the full war establishment of 315,000 men which they had been led to believe would be the absolute minimum for a Home Defence Force consistent with safety, thereby considerably adding to the difficulties of an already sufficiently difficult task; further, to ask the Secretary of State for War whether his attention has been called to a speech delivered at Tiverton by the late Financial Secretary to the War Office, in which he stated that&#x2014;
<quote>'We are now provided in every way so that within forty-eight hours of an alarm being given the Territorial Force could stand forth absolutely equipped with everything it might need to (ace any invasion or sudden emergency that might arise ';</quote>
<col>976</col>
"whether the 'absolute equipment' includes the complete war establishment of men and horses which will presumably be required if the Territorial Force is ' to stand forth absolutely equipped with everything it might need to face an invasion '; whether this view is supported by the G.O.C.'s. in-Chief; whether he can tell us if there is any single unit in the Territorial Force that could be so equipped within a much longer period than forty-eight hours; and whether it would not be well to give instructions to the Under-Secretary of State, the Financial Secretary to the War Office, and the Paymaster-General of the Forces, to refrain from making such absurd statements, which, if any reliance is still placed on the pronouncements of our ever-changing Ministers, can only have the effect of lulling the country into a state of false security."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03480">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I have ventured to give notice of this Question, because it raises the matter of two recent pronouncements of members of His Majesty's Government, pronouncements which seem to me to raise a very serious question, and, considering the present difficulties of those who are responsible for running the Territorial Force, call for explanation. The Secretary of State for War recently referred to the peace establishment of the Territorial Force as consisting of 250,000 men. I want to know when it was decided that there was any peace establishment of the Territorial Force at all. I had always understood that the Home Defence Force was, in itself, a peace established Force, and that it was put there for the purpose of defending the country. In the original scheme the numbers of the Territorial Force were put down at 315,000 men. From debates that have taken place here we know that a great many members of this House look upon that number as totally inadequate; but those of us on whose shoulders has been placed the responsibility of organising the Territorial Force accepted that figure as being the number recommended to the Army Council by the military experts who advised the Government, but we have always understood that 315,000 men is the minimum of safety in the matter of our defence force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03481">I think it was during last session that the noble Viscount referred in another
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0493"/>
<col>977</col>
place to the small margin that he had said must exist between the full establishment and the actual numbers in order to provide for the coming in and the going out of members of the Force that annually takes place, and I remember that I went so far as to suggest that the establishment should be increased in order to cover that margin. I ask, When was this settled? Why should we have been given the duty of raising this Force when we have never been informed that the peace establishment of the Territorial Force consists of 250,000 men? Take the case of the county of Staffordshire, where at one time we had practically our full establishment. At present we are not quite up to that standard, though we have 94 or 95 per cent. Surely the noble Viscount will realise as fully as we do the difficulties facing us in the immediate future. The first four years have conic to an end, and we are at our wits ends to know how it will be possible to keep up the establishment with the large number of men who will go out. It seems to me that when they understand that 250,000 is our peace establishment they will say, when we ask them to sign on again, "Why worry? We have now more than the numbers of our peace establishment." That will be one of the difficulties, and I cannot understand why it is necessary at this late hour to inform us that 250,000 men is the peace establishment, when we have been engaged all the time in endeavouring, in a time of peace, to raise the full establishment of 315,000 men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03482">The second part of my Question refers to a speech recently delivered at Tiverton by the late Financial Secretary to the War Office. It was of such an amazing character that I hope the noble Viscount will be able to give us some satisfactory explanation of its meaning. These are the words which Mr. Acland used&#x2014;
<quote>"We are now provided in every way so that within 48 hours of an alarm being given the Territorial Force could stand forth absolutely equipped with everything it might need to face any invasion or sudden emergency that might arise."</quote>
I should like to give your Lordships, if you will allow me, my experience with regard to this question of mobilisation. As far back as January 31, 1910, I addressed a series of some thirty questions to the Secretary to the War Office dealing with
<col>978</col>
details of mobilisation. I sent a covering letter showing the difficulty that we should have in the case of sudden mobilisation, and pressed the importance of the point that secretaries to County Associations should have clearly defined what in that event they would have to provide and what, would be supplied by the military authorities. I wrote again on June 2 of that year, and seven days later received an acknowledgement to the effect that the matter had not been forgotten and that it was hoped that a reply might shortly be sent. In acknowledging that letter I asked what interpretation might be put on the word "shortly." This letter I followed up with one on December 28, 1910, and on December 31 I was informed that definite replies would be sent to the questions as soon as certain details connected with the Territorial Force mobilisation had been decided. It does not require a Sherlock Holmes to deduce from these facts that in the opinion of the War Office the word "shortly" means "any period of time over eighteen months." To the original questions I have so far had no reply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03483">I want to emphasise the fact that while we are told that we can be absolutely equipped in forty-eight hours it has taken more than two years for the Secretary to the War Office to tell us what we arc to provide in the event of mobilisation. Colonel Seely, in an answer to a Question on this subject in another place said, "It is purely a question of finance." How can this possibly be confined to a question of finance? If it is a question of finance on which alone we depend in case of invasion, the only interpretation to be put on it is that if the enemy comes the Secretary for War hopes he will have sufficient funds to bribe the invader to go away. Then I would like to know what absolute equipment" means&#x2014;whether men and horses. We know something about horses. I do not wish to emphasise the difficulty in that respect, but there is a Biblical comparison which I think might fairly be made. I think it was Rab-shakeh who said to Hezekiah, "I will give you a horse if you will find a rider to put upon it "; but our modern Rab-shakeh says, "You give me a horse and I will put three riders upon it." While no doubt that particular horse would be fully equipped with regard to riders, there is nothing to show that the rest of
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0494"/>
<col>979</col>
the establishment would be equally complete. Therefore it would be interesting to know how far this "absolute equipment" is carried out by actual facts. I also ask whether this view expressed by the Financial Secretary is supported by the G.O.C.'s-in-Chief. I think the answer in another place was that those reports were confidential. But surely we, who are engaged in raising this Force and are supposed to hand it over in a state of efficiency, at least have a right to know whether a statement like this, made by a representative of the Government, is really accurate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03484">There is one minor point in connection with mobilisation to which I would like to refer. A great deal no doubt depends on the efficiency of the officers, and we very often hear criticisms of the officers of the Territorial Force. The examination now imposed upon all officers who are going up for promotion is, I believe, much the same as that which a subaltern in the Regular Army is asked to pass. The difference, of course, is this&#x2014;with the Regular subaltern it is his job, with the Territorial officer it is not. No doubt it is necessary that there should be some form, and very likely mime very severe form, of examination. The complaint I have to make is that these books on which they are examined are not obtainable. The answer given over and over again to those who go in for these examinations and desire these works is that the books are either obsolete or out of print, at any rate they are not obtainable. Take as an illustration the "Field Service Pocket Book," and the "King's Regulations." I believe that for the first time candidates for these examinations have been allowed to take the "Field Service Pocket Book." I know the case of a man who wrote for a copy. The examination began on December 4 and on December 1 he received an intimation that the book was not obtainable. The same thing happened with regard to the "King's Regulations." I believe that the answer to this objection of mine is that these two books are merely provisional, and are under revision; but when you remember the class of men that you examine, it seems very hard on them that they should be examined in books that may be altered to-morrow.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03485">I will give your Lordships one of several instances. The man I refer to is a builder
<col>980</col>
in rather a big way of business. He is employed all day, and therefore has to work at the subjects for the examination in the evenings. It is very hard if he cannot actually obtain the books in which he is going to be examined. I know the great discouragement thus given to Territorial officers, and when we find, as I believe was the case the last time, that some 50 per cent. of the candidates fail, no doubt there is a very good explanation for it. I would like to press very strongly that those who are to be examined should have an opportunity of obtaining the books in which they are to be examined. On my general Questions, I do hope the noble Viscount will be able to give us some consolation and undertake that our great difficulties will not be added to by statements such as those to which I have referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03486"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: On the last point to which the noble Earl has referred with regard to the examinations and the books, if the facts be what he says I heartily agree with him. It is very wrong if people are examined on books which are obsolete. Unfortunately, I have had no notice from the noble Earl of this matter and have had no means of inquiring, but I shall make inquiry&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03487"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I did not give any notice to the noble Viscount of this point, because the examination is over. Perhaps he will have time before the next examination to go into the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03488"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes; but I think the noble Earl might have given me notice before raising it in this House, because it goes out, and I have no means of revising it; but I shall make stringent inquiries to-morrow. If I bad had notice I should have been glad to make some inquiries and to give this House sonic assurance one way or the other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03489"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry I did not give notice, but there have been Questions asked about it in another place. Had I known that the noble Viscount required an intimation beforehand I should certainly have given it to him.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0495"/>
<col>981</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03490"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I certainly required an intimation. I now come to the other point. The noble Earl asks when it was decided by the Army Council that there should be a peace establishment of 250,000 for the Territorial Force as distinguished from a war establishment. The answer is that it has never been so decided. I have never either said or suggested anything of the kind, and the references as to myself having spoken of these things arc not supported by any words which the noble Earl quoted, nor could he find words used by me to that effect. That I have said is that the Territorial Force is unfortunately below its full establishment at this time. I have said there is no magic in 315,000 men, but it is the duty of everybody interested in the Territorial Force, and particularly of those who are responsible for it, to work in every way they can to get it up to the full establishment. But we always knew that there would be periods, and it might be prolonged periods, when we should not be up to the establishment. But it is no use talking of that, and saying that the end of the world has come. Then the noble Earl has quoted me as having said in February, 1907, in introducing the Territorial scheme in the House of Commons, that it might well be that there would be periods during which the numbers would not be very much more than a quarter of a million. Even so, I added, we were not to lose heart, but were simply to take that as the state of things we had to deal with, and work as hard as we could to get the full establishment. But I have never for a moment suggested at any time that there is a peace establishment of a quarter of a million as distinguished from a war establishment, or talked such nonsense as somebody seems to have put into my mouth and which the noble Earl has got hold of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03491"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I will send the noble Viscount the quotation which I took front the report of his speech which appeared in <i>The Times</i> a little while ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03492"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: <i>The Times</i> is very unlike itself if it has made me say that there is a peace, as distinguished from a war establishment, and that the number was a quarter of a million, and that the Army Council had so decided. I am sorry if the noble Earl has been misled into thinking that I have said anything of the
<col>982</col>
sort, and no reporter was justified in representing anything of the kind as my words. It is of the essence of the Territorial Force that it should have only one establishment and we have always maintained that every one responsible should endeavour to get the numbers up to that amount. The only thing that has been said, and said all along, is that you cannot expect to be always up to a war establishment, and that, even if you went down to 250,000, that is no reason for losing heart or despairing of your Force. You have got something that is very good to work on even with these numbers, and it should only be a reason for your working no less strenuously in order to get your full numbers. That is all I have to say about this myth of the two establish merits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03493"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I ant very pleased it has been cleared away.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03494"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to have been of assistance to the noble Earl in this matter. With regard to the next question, there again the noble Earl has quoted the late Financial Secretary as having said that the Territorial Force was absolutely equipped with everything it might need to face any invasion or sudden emergency that might arise. I have looked at several reports of the speech and I do not wonder that the noble Earl has been misled by some of them, because they are mostly about six lines long. But I did see some eighteen to twenty lines long, and it is clear that my hon. friend was referring to what he was speaking about&#x2014;namely, that, he had provided money sufficient to enable mobilisation to be complete in forty-eight hours. My hon. friend maintains that he did, before he left office, provide that money, and. I have reason to think he is accurate in that statement. He did not say that everything was complete and ready. I quite agree with the noble Earl that there are many things that will have to be done before you have got perfect machinery for mobilisation, but I have made careful inquiries from those who know the Territorial Force, and they tell me that the only-difficulties that remain are wagons and horses.<lb/>
As regards horses, a very large part of the country is now far advanced with the operations of a new scheme for providing horses, and it is only a matter of a very
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0496"/>
<col>983</col>
short time before the bulk of the horses will be provided for the Territorial Force. They are already provided for the six divisions of the Regular Army and the Cavalry Division. The work ought to be completed within a very few months, and in many places the horses have been sufficiently marked out to mobilise the Territorial Force. As for three men going on one horse, of course we all know that for ordinary training the Territorial Force authorities hire horses, and those horses serve very often for three successive trainings. If these were the only horses it would be three to one, but on mobilisation that has nothing whatever to do with the state of things as you have a right to take horses, and the only question is, Have you classified them, censused them, marked them down, and are they there? There will be a horse for every man who requires a horse; and, as I say, that process is far advanced. There has always been a controversy about wagons. In the provision of wagons the noble Earl has worked with distinguished success; he has raised numbers, and his is one of the most efficient Associations in the country. I do not know whether he has raised this question, but a number of the Associations would like to have a certain type of wagon. We have always said that for your first line of transport you must have these wagons, and many of these have been sent to them; but we have told them that for the rest they must mobilise, as is done in Switzerland, with civilian carts and wagons&#x2014;that they must mark them down, and they have done that. Wagons were never in discussion very much; there has been more real question as to horses, and as far as I know the horse problem is now very close to a final solution.<lb/>
What else is there about mobilisation? The rifles, the guns, the ammunition, the clothing, the equipment are there. I inquired to-day, "How does it stand with the Territorial Force if we were ordered to mobilise at once?" The answer was that the Infantry could be sent at once to their stations. That ought to be done within twenty-four hours in the existing state of things. Until the horse supply is quite complete it might take four days before the mounted arms were properly supplied&#x2014;of course where the horse census is very far behind it would naturally take longer, but it ought not to take longer than that. But the mobilisa-
<col>984</col>
tion of a Citizen Force is never the most precise and beautiful thing, and never can be the same precise thing that the mobilisation of a Regular Force is. You do not spend the same money on it, but you get a very effective mobilisation. The stations are defined, the units are marked out, the orders given to assemble arid to concentrate, they go in detachments and arrive at the place of assembly, and in that way this Force is mobilised, and I am told that the Territorial Force could be mobilised very rapidly. I am giving the noble Earl the answers I got to-day on inquiry at the proper department. I am far from saying that the mobilisation of a Citizen Force can anything like approach the beauty and precision of the mobilisation of a Regular Force, but what we want is expedition with a due regard to public safety. I think I have covered the points raised by the noble Earl. I am sorry if some reporter has taken words of mine and turned them into suggestions showing this difference between peace establishment and war establishment. The noble Earl has raised a splendid contingent in his part of the country, a contingent which is a model for the Territorial Force. I trust that what I have been reported to have said will not affect the exertions of the noble Earl, because I think I have shown him that what has been attributed to me is mythical.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03495"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene for a moment, not to continue the discussion which always does arise on these occasions with reference to the position of this Force, but merely to point out what seem to be some discrepancies in the speeches recently made by the Secretary of State for War. In a speech at Tranent at the end of September the noble Viscount said that he was going to use the Territorial Force for all it was worth the first day of war. "For all that it was worth" obviously implies that it was worth a very great deal. But more recently I observe that in a speech made to the 6th Battalion of the City of London Rifles on December 1, he asserted that a compulsory force of men trained for four or six months, in the opinion of his best advisers, would be of no use. I feel disposed to ask the noble Viscount whether when he made the first statement he was guided by the opinion of his best advisers, or possibly it was the opinion of his second best advisers.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0497"/>
<col>985</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03496"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I said it would be of no use opposed man to man to Continental troops trained for two or three years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03497"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: But the report which I read terminated with the word "use." Therefore I do not see that the argument is materially affected by the addition made by the noble Viscount. But what I want to know is whether he was equally guided by the opinion of those best advisers when he made the speech saying he was going to utilise the Territorial Force from the first day of war, because it is perfectly evident that if in the opinion of the best advisers men who have been trained for four or six months are of no practical use, they arc not likely to have a high opinion of the value of men trained for a period of only about two weeks. This being presumably the view of the best advisers of the noble Viscount, I should like to ask him what is their opinion of the Special Reserve, the special force which happens to be trained for that particular period? So far from drawing the conclusion which my noble friend does in his Question that there are a number of persons in this country who are lulled into a state of false security by virtue of these somewhat conflicting statements, to me they only create the impression that the noble Viscount, with his accustomed ingenuity, is doing his best to conceal the breakdown of the system for which he himself has expressed so much admiration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03498"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, have only one question to ask, and that is whether the noble Viscount relies on the statement of Mr. Acland, or whether he admits, as by implication lie does, that that was an overdrawn picture of the condition of the Territorial Force. I am not going into the difficulties which we discussed, on a recent occasion, but I put it to the noble Viscount that these extravagant statements as to our preparedness&#x2014;statements which Financial Secretaries and Under-Secretaries who file through the War Office and imbibe Lord Haldane's optimism deliver with absolute conviction while they stand, so to speak, by his side, but the moment they are emancipated they seem to cast oft a good deal of that which they have imbibed and so readily assimilated&#x2014;these extravagant statements, from his own point of view, from the point of view of the obvious reaction which must come
<col>986</col>
whenever the Force is examined by somebody who has not got the paternal interest in it which Lord Haldane has, ought to be checked. Nothing has clone more to handicap us on this side of the House in supporting all that is best in the system which he has set on foot than the fact that an amount is claimed for it such as no system of voluntary service could hope to obtain. The late Financial Secretary to the War Office is reported to have said that within forty-eight hours the Territorial Force could stand forth absolutely equipped. I wish to see it in that condition. So far as my noble friend behind me and others on this side of the House can, we will assist the noble Viscount to do it. But we know that the matter has not been accomplished yet, and I put it to him that it is not only unwise but misleading that these statements should be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03499"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I have explained what the late Financial Secretary said&#x2014;namely, that he had provided the money. What lie was thinking of was the fact that at the time we had a good deal of money. It so happened. It does not so often happen at the War Office, and one of the things required was to supply certain things to the Territorial Force. That was clone, and the money was set aside, and my hon. friend who was leaving us naturally looked back with pride at having supplied sufficient money to enable the Territorial Force to be mobilised in forty-eight hours completely equipped. Whether he was sanguine in that view or not, I do not say, but lie had seen to the money. As regards the point raised by Lord Newton, I was speaking solely of men put against Continental trained Regulars.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03500"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: But may I ask, Whom else would they be expected to fight?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03501"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I said that, in the opinion of my best advisers, men who had been trained from four to six mouths were not fit to meet, man for man, Regulars who had been trained for two or three years; and I have never suggested that the Territorial Force should meet them man for man. The whole point of the Territorial Force is that you have vastly superior numbers to anything that could be landed in this country. That is a very different proposition, and
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0498"/>
<col>987</col>
I do not see any inconsistency in what I said in the two speeches referred to by Lord Newton. It may be my stupidity, but I cannot see the inconsistency. As for assuming a sanguine attitude, in the face of all the gloomy predictions which come to me from all hands about the Territorial Force, what else can I do but endeavour to preserve a decent equanimity.</membercontribution></p>

<col>991</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03528"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask your Lordships to let me say a few words on this subject at this stage. It is proposed that the House should go into Committee on this Bill. If any of your Lordships were explaining, say, to a child or a foreigner what going into Committee meant, the answer would be that it meant to consider the Bill in its details, clause by clause, and that is actually the description of the Committee stage which is given in a popular text book on the subject. But, my Lords, it would be ludicrous, but for its element of tragedy, that the Second Chamber, which everybody says ought to be a revising Chamber, should be offered at a few hours' notice the opportunity of considering and revising the details of a Bill of 115 clauses and eight schedules, covering 140 printed pages. The importance of the matter consists largely to my mind in this, that this is a Bill, not of a formal or consolidating or uncontroversial kind in detail, however uncontroversial in principle, but a Bill which bristles with intricacies which affect every grade and class of people throughout the land and practically raises issues which must make themselves felt in almost every house.<lb/>
I am anxious that it should be emphasised, because I doubt whether it has been emphasised enough, how cordially the whole House&#x2014;certainly I can speak for a very large section of it&#x2014;welcomes the proposal and intent of this Bill. That approval is not conventional, but heartfelt and genuine satisfaction that an endeavour should be made to deal with the grave and real evils which this Bill sets itself to combat. The cause is the very noblest which can be committed to our trust. It is to take charge of the welfare of the poorest and the neediest. That is a duty, I venture to say, which devolves especially upon those who have the privilege of a seat in this House. I do not know whether you remember the phrase in which part, at least, of such duties was defined in the Middle Ages in connection with the foremost Order of Knighthood in this country&#x2014;the Order of the Garter. The Installation ceremony comprises an injunction that the object and purpose of the men thus ennobled should always be "the just and necessary defence of those who are oppressed and needy." My Lords, that is precisely what
<col>992</col>
we want to do at this time. We want to help. What we are uncertain about is whether or not we are really by the enactment which we are requested to pass aiding in the just and necessary defence of those among us who are actually most oppressed and needy. That is the question that is before your Lordships.<lb/>
So far as I can judge, this is a brave and somewhat adventurous attempt to accomplish in a few weeks and in one Bill an undertaking which might easily have occupied a great many months of inquiry, and many months of work for each separate section of it. I believe that without such time being devoted to it it is doubtful whether it will fulfil in its fulness the purpose which we, quite as much as those who have constructed the Bill, are anxious that it should fulfil. To deal with it in that way now is, of course, an utterly impossible task. I will not try to allot to anyone any blame. It may have been through over-hopefulness; it may have been an under-estimate of its multiplicity of detail; it may have been an expectation that authoritative statements made in a loud voice would be accepted as conclusive, without its being thought necessary to have them more quietly discussed. That, however, is how the matter comes to us now.<lb/>
The question has been asked&#x2014;I have seen it asked in the public Press and elsewhere within the last few days&#x2014;If the members of the House of Lords find themselves taken aback by the Bill, what have they been doing for the last two months, and why did they not study it before it came here? That is exactly what we tried to do. I speak as one of those who, as soon as this Bill began to be discussed in detail, endeavoured to understand its provisions and find out what would be their incidence if they became law upon this or that class of the population. But that became an absolute impossibility. No kaleidoscope that ever was devised by man changed its form and its hue with such rapidity and in so incomprehensible a manner as was the case with this particular Bill. It is literally true to say that a page which one thought one had mastered in one day was unrecognisable when one saw it afresh, and the published account of how these changes came about would be comprised in a few lines of a newspaper. It has been simply impossible, I am certain, for any-
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0501"/>
<col>993</col>
body except those who in the fullest sense are behind the scenes, the constructors and authors of this Bill, to follow in detail what these changes really meant. They may have been good or they may have been bad, but we have no possible means of knowing.<lb/>
The Bill comes to us now as something which has been threshed out in the House of Commons. I notice that to-night the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill has 101 Amendments down to the Bill. What would have happened if it had not come here at all, and had passed irrevocably from the House of Commons in a form that needed 101 and more Amendments? I have no doubt that they are all excellent Amendments, but we have no means of considering their details. There is no time to gain any knowledge of the details of the Bill. How can we be expected to discharge the task supposed to be that of a Second Chamber if a Bill comes to us in this way? It may have been inevitable. I am not blaming anybody, but stating the fact. We are simply denied an opportunity of co-operating and trying to make this Bill as good as it can possibly be made, and as far as I can see the only course open to us is to leave it to its authors and constructors and then to hope for the best. It may be a hope which some; of us cherish with confidence, while others of us may feel a little more uneasy about it, but it seems to me to be the only course open to us. I am not suggesting that we should take any other, but we might, at least, be given a definite reply on questions which seem to us not to be answered in the Bill, as to the meaning of points about which we are at this moment in uncertainty.<lb/>
I will take a specific instance because it is one which affects the profession to which I belong. I refer to the question of whether or not an assistant curate comes under the terms of this Bill as being one who holds a contract of service. That question was debated in the House of Commons. It was raised and discussed on both sides, and the answer was, "We do not know." The Law Officers virtually declared that they could not tell whether it was so or not, and ultimately it came to this, that the matter would have to be settled, if at all, by litigation. Now, my Lords, I ask is that a fair position in which to put thousands of men who are amongst
<col>994</col>
the most deserving and hard-working of the population, and certainly not amongst the best paid of the population? I imagine myself in the place of an incumbent who has two or three curates working under him. It may be that the interpretation is going to be that he is liable as an employer under a contract of service, and then he has three possibilities open to him. He may at once begin to put stamps upon the paper, and get his <i>employ&#x00E9;s,</i> so called, to put stamps upon the paper, and it may be possible that a little later it will be found that the whole of that money has been thrown away, because it turns out to be not a contract of service at all. Or he may take the other line and say, "I will do nothing." But by a clause in the Bill he finds himself under a penalty of &#x00A3;10 for not having carried out what may be ultimately proved to have been the duty he was meant to have carried out, and he is then in a position of no small difficulty. Or he may decide that the matter is to be settled, as we have been told, by litigation. Is it fair that that should be the mode in which the matter is left when it leaves Parliament?<lb/>
I venture to hope that the noble Viscount to-night will be able to do what the authorities in the House of Commons found themselves unable to do, and tell us clearly whether this Bill is intended or not intended to include the men to whom I have referred. Personally, I hope that the answer may be that it is not intended to include them. I believe that to be the true interpretation of the principle upon which such service is rendered, and these men would not fall, as far as I can understand it, naturally under the provisions of this Bill. But that was not by any means clearly stated to us in the House of Commons by the legal authorities there, and I venture to hope that we may have a definite decision given to us to-night. But my object in rising was to say how cordially many of us who are prevented from discussing the Bill in detail desire to give our endorsement to the principles which underlie this adventurous endeavour, and how cordially we hope that, notwithstanding the difficulties of bringing these principles into practice, it may turn out to fulfil all the highest hopes which have been detailed to this House as to its purpose and its intent.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03529"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not dispute anything which has fallen from the most rev. Primate as to the hardship which may occur to stipendiary curates. That point my noble friend who is in charge of the Bill will deal with. But the most rev. Primate opens up a very large but perfectly legitimate topic&#x2014;namely, the difficulty&#x2014;and a stronger word might be used&#x2014;of the position in which the House finds itself in dealing with a Bill of this enormous compass, range, and magnitude, with only a few hours in which to supervise it. Nobody is more alive than I am to the fatal element which the most rev. Primate has referred to, and I wondered very often during the discussions upon the Parliament Act that more notice was not taken in the course of the debates of the fatal difficulty in which this House will always stand, whether it be reconstituted or whatever may happen to it, if Bills of importance and magnitude come up leaving a very insufficient time for their full discussion. Noble Lords opposite, who have far more experience of this House than I have, must know that this is as things are, and as I am afraid they are still likely to be, inevitable. You cannot get Bills up from the House of Commons, if they are Bills of importance, so early that this House is left free to deal with them.<lb/>
The only Act that I have had the honour of introducing and piloting through Parliament was the Indian Councils Act. I was able to introduce it in this House. In this House it was most adequately, fully, and fairly discussed, and that was no doubt a Bill of the first importance. But there are Bills which must evidently be introduced in another place, and it is equally evident that they cannot be brought up here at any very early date. But that is a general consideration which I think it right to mention. This is an annual story&#x2014;a hardy annual story. In the year 1901, when noble Lords opposite sat on this side, the Factory and Workshops Bill came up from the other House. I am not going into the transaction, but I would like to read to your Lordships a few sentences that were used on that occasion by so faithful and admirable a representative of noble Lords opposite as the Duke of Northumberland. On August 15,
<col>996</col>
1901, the Duke of Northumberland said this&#x2014;
<quote>"We are on the eve of the holidays, and during the recess some of us may attend public meetings, and at those meetings the question is sometimes asked, 'Is the House of Lords worth preserving?' What is the use of the House of Lords if a Bill of this magnitude and importance is to be presented at a time when it cannot be discussed, and when it is forced practically down our throats whether we like it or not."</quote>
Then at the end of this stage the noble Duke said&#x2014;
<quote> "Lord James has said that this Bill has 100 new points in it, and yet the House of Lords is told to take it or leave it."</quote>
And the noble Duke added&#x2014;
<quote>"This was the way in which a Conservative Government supported the House of Lords."</quote>
I only recite that reminiscence in order to show that this is a very old story, and, so far as I can sec, whatever you do with this House, it will be a standing story.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03530"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I remember perfectly well the circumstances of the Factory and Workshops Bill of 1901, but they were not comparable with the state of things with which we are now confronted. But, after all, what does the answer of the noble Viscount amount to? It amounts only to what is called a <i>tu quoque.</i> I confess I am sorry that in the past this House has been so submissive. I think that the circumstances of the Parliament Bill to a large extent alter the justification for bringing up Bills as has been done at the end of this session in a way, whatever the noble Viscount may say, which I maintain is absolutely unprecedented, and it is done at a time of year when it makes it absolutely impossible for us to take a longer time over the Bills. In August of 1901 the House, if it had chosen, could have taken a few more days. At present, owing to circumstances which are known to everybody, we are debarred from doing that if we wish.<lb/>
I do not desire to prolong this discussion, but I have been thinking&#x2014;and I shall probably take an opportunity of calling attention to this on an early day in another session&#x2014;that a remedy, at any rate with regard to the class of Bills of this description, could be found in an amendment of procedure which would enable us to do more in the way of carrying over Bills from one session to another. That has
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0503"/>
<col>997</col>
been done frequently in the case of Private Bills, and I see no Constitutional difficulty in extending that practice to Bills of another class. But, of course, it would require the cordial co-operation of both Houses of Parliament. Each House is master of its own procedure, and there might be a carrying over of Bills to another session if they should choose to do so. But, my Lords, obviously it cannot be so useful unless there is the co-operation of the other House of Parliament. Take the Shops Bill. If we were to carry over that measure to another session it would have to go through all its stages in the other House, unless by the adoption of some Standing Order a Bill could be taken up at the same stage at which it had been previously in the preceding session. I am not going to elaborate that at the moment, but I venture to call the attention of the noble Viscount to it, because if his speech meant anything at all it was simply a throwing up of his hands in despair at the state of things of which this House was a victim and at an inevitable circumstance which it could not get over. If the noble Viscount did not mean that, I apologise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03531"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I did not say the House could not get over it. I think I used the word "inevitable," but I meant inevitable under the present line of argument followed by both Parties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03532"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: With that qualification it seems to me hardly worth calling inevitable. If there was good will on both sides I venture to say that the simple proposal which I am only indicating at the moment is one which would get over a great many practical difficulties, and would restore to this House its position as a revising Chamber which along with other privileges has been taken away from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03533"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to continue this discussion. It is, no doubt, a very interesting subject, and will be discussed at some suitable time. But so far as this Bill is concerned, what we virtually decided on the Second Reading was to get on with it. I rise now to give an answer to the most rev. Primate on the question of law which he raised, as to whether a curate comes within this Bill or not. The definition in the
<col>998</col>
First Schedule is that employment under this Bill means employment under a contract of service or apprenticeship. If the most rev. Primate will refer to the discussions in Committee in the other House he will find that the meaning of these words was very much discussed and that the Law Officers, notably Sir John Simon, the Solicitor-General gave a very strong opinion, after consideration, that a curate was not within these words. I myself have, with the best ability I possess, gone into the question, and it seems to me that a curate is a person who is there in virtue, not merely of a contract, but in virtue of his <i>status.</i> He is licensed by the Bishop, and without that licence he could not be there or perform his functions. No doubt in a sense he is employed by the incumbent, but I think he would be very much astonished if he was treated as a servant within the scope of this Bill, which you must look at as a whole in order to see what is meant by contract of service or employment or apprenticeship. Speaking for myself I do not think a curate comes within these words, and I think the most rev. Primate may be content to rely upon that view. At the end of Clause 68 there is power given to the Insurance Commissioners to decide the question of any difficulty about a penalty arising, and anybody following the decisions which the Insurance Commissioners give will see that is so. Therefore on a double ground the House is asked to act upon the view of the Government that curates are not within the section. Thirdly&#x2014;because there is a third ground&#x2014;the Government would be bound to get anybody out of the trouble they would have got into if a wrong view of the law had been taken. Therefore I think we may proceed on the footing that curates are not included. To try to put a definition clause in would be the most difficult thing in the world, because there are a great many contracts of employment which are not contracts of service or apprenticeship though they may look like it, and to define by excluding a curate would be to suggest that by reason of some other ground somebody else came within this Bill. Therefore it is on all grounds inadvisable to attempt such a definition. One can only rely on the law as it stands. I speak in the presence of much higher authority, but my own opinion is that a curate undoubtedly is not within the provisions of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<col>999</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03534"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to say anything as regards the case of the curate, but I do desire to say a word in particular as to the observation made a moment ago by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh. The most rev. Primate protested against the manner in which this House has been treated with regard to the Bill upon the Table. I have already made my protest, and I do not wish to repeat it this evening. But what I do wish to say, as strongly as I can, is that we on this side of the House cannot accept the proposition which is apparently suggested by the noble Viscount who leads the House when he tells us that this old scandal&#x2014;for it is an old scandal&#x2014;is "inevitable as things are." Those were his words, and he said it was one to the recurrence of which this House must look forward for all time. The noble Viscount talks of its being inevitable as things are. But he has forgotten that things to-day are no longer what they were twelve months ago, or before that. He has forgotten that this House has been shorn of the greater part of its powers, and that therefore a double injury is inflicted upon it when we are, in the first place, deprived of the greater part of our powers, and, in the second place, denied the legitimate opportunity of exercising those powers that are still left to us. I do not agree with the noble Viscount when he says that whatever we do this grievance must continue. I feel convinced, that the question of the position of this House in regard to its opportunities for dealing with measures coming from the other House of Parliament will have to be seriously considered, and that whenever the time comes&#x2014;as it must&#x2014;for dealing with the whole question of the constitution of the Second Chamber and its relations to the other He use of Parliament, this question will call aloud for a settlement more satisfactory than anything which has yet been offered to us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03535"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are two topics that I wish to refer to, and as this is the only opportunity of doing so I will speak on both although they are very diverse from each other. With reference to the first, I have no doubt in the world that the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill will concur with me that this conversation and the opinions expressed, however illuminating they may be to your Lordships, will have no place in the construction of this Bill when it
<col>1000</col>
comes before a Court of Justice. But I certainly am of opinion, looking at the whole Bill and the object and purport of it, that a curate is not in "employment." The terms "service" and "employment" are not appropriate in that sense, and if I were construing the language myself I should come to the conclusion that a curate was not included in the Bill.<lb/>
The other point is to my mind a much more serious one than the particular question with which we have been dealing, and, as I say, I only refer to it now because this is my only opportunity upon this stage of the Bill. My protest&#x2014;for that really is what it comes to&#x2014;is practically upon Clause 62 of the Bill, which deals with the question of insanitary places and unusual and extraordinary sickness. Now, my Lords, this is not the only occasion on which I have had to make exactly the same protest. The person who is to try that question, to try the very intricate and difficult question which is raised by the sixty-second clause, is to be a "competent person" appointed by the Government. From time to time I have had to make the same protest&#x2014;that real questions of law and very difficult questions of law are not left to the Court to decide but are left to some person or another appointed by the Government. I hold in my hand a protest made by persons who certainly profess to be very widely interested in such questions&#x2014;I refer to the Association of Municipal Corporations, the County Councils Association, the Urban District Councils Association, and the Rural Districts Councils Association. They say they are the four associations who represent together the local authorities of this country. Whether that last claim is absolutely correct or not I will not say without further investigation. But what they state is this, that the questions raised in this clause affect them, as they may be the principal sufferers in consequence of the default which is supposed to give rise to what follows. What they say&#x2014;and I wish most heartily to concur in the language which they use&#x2014;is this:
<quote>"We respectfully submit that if Parliament deems it right to approve the general principles of the clause and to retain it in the Bill provision should be inserted giving an absolute right to the parties affected to appeal from the decision of the person holding the inquiry to the tribunal provided by this country who would examine the matters judicially. It would be, we submit, a grave misfortune if, when Parliament enacts important and far-reaching and unprecedented
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0505"/>
<col>1001</col>
provisions, the bodies thereby affected were deprived of their right to appeal to the Courts of Law."</quote>
I will only add to those words that last week your Lordships, by a large majority, insisted upon an appeal in the Scottish Landholders Bill with regard to a proposal which shows the tendency, and I am sorry to say the increasing tendency, on the part of the Government to try and get rid of the supervision of the Courts of Law.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03590"><member>LORD BYRON</member> moved to substitute "institutional" for "sanatorium" where that word first appeared in the clause. The noble Lord said: The object of this Amendment, and in fact of all the Amendments standing in my name, is to comprehend within the scope of this Bill as many as possible of the existing hospitals, and this for two reasons. First of all, in the case of accidents these institutions provide the very best accommodation and the very best medical attendance. The idea is no longer that any injured person goes to these hospitals under the stigma of charity. Secondly, I wish that the people should utilise these hospitals more during the gradual establishment of sanatoria. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking at Birmingham on June 10 last, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The first thing to do in our Bill is to provide adequate medical treatment for every workman in the United Kingdom."</quote>
Such adequate treatment must include hospital treatment, and experience has shown that such treatment requires at least two free beds per thousand of the population. At present few hospitals can afford to give a probation bed to insured persons without recourse to the Government or to the insured.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03591">The population of Greater London, according to the last Census, was about 7&#x00BC; millions, and the number of persons
<col>1008</col>
who will be insured is estimated at 2&#x00BD; millions. To secure adequate accommodation for this number about 5,000 beds will be required for sole use. The London hospitals contain altogether about 10,500 beds, of which about 10,000 are constantly occupied. If, therefore, as is estimated, the subscriptions to these hospitals decline to the extent of 40 per cent. there will only remain about 6,000 beds, or not more than 1,000 more than is required under the Bill for the insured. I notice that "hospital" occurs in Clause 12, section 2 (<i>c</i>) as being available in certain cases only, but I do not know if it occurs elsewhere. I have not been able to find out. The phrase "sanatorium or similar institution" occurs several times, so that the principle of hospital treatment seems already to be introduced, but in the case which is alluded to the persons qualified for admittance appear to be those who have no dependants, which must, of course, exclude a great number.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03592">The object of my Amendment is to free these hospitals to all insured persons, wherever necessary, by agreement between the Commissioners and the hospital authorities by a <i>pro rata</i> payment to be set aside for a certain number of wards and beds for such persons. Then, turning to Clause 16, I have later on an Amendment which concerns the question of accidents in hospitals. As accidents are occurring every day it is quite impossible for an insured person who has been injured to go before the local Medical Board, the Board of Health, before he is admitted to the hospital, and the object of my Amendment which comes later in Clause 16 is to enable the insured person to go to the hospitals on the recommendation of a qualified medical officer. My second object, as I say, is to utilise the hospitals as sanatoria. For instance, the various consumptive and kindred hospitals would come in here, although I do not understand that the sanatoria are alone to be used for pulmonary complaints. They are, I suppose, to be used for complaints of all kinds, and the arrangements I have spoken of, if made, would give time for the various sanatoria to arise. It would be possible, says the <i>Hospital</i> newspaper, under a matured and careful scheme, for the hospital bed area gradually to cover the whole ground of sanatoria and hospital accommodation out of the fund provided under the Bill as it stands at present.</p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0509"/>
<col>1009</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03593">My idea is that it would be almost unnecessary to erect sanatoria if we used all available hospital accommodation. There would remain, of course, the question of the increased hospital accommodation that would be necessary for the general public by the absorption of so many beds by the insured. But this would be partly met by the adoption of the Continental system, where the patients are divided into four different classes; it would be partly met by the fact that many of the ordinary patients would be amongst the insured; and it would be partly met by a system of loans by the local board, which would be repaid by a sinking fund to be provided by the hospitals, with a clearance of the loans from time to time. The expense to these hospitals would not be so great as would at first sight appear, because many of them already have building sites on which annexes could be erected for temporary purposes, or, if it was decided to use them as sanatoria, permanent buildings. The <i>Hospital</i> newspaper which I have just quoted said in its number of December 9&#x2014;
<quote>"As the Amendment would indicate, a sum set aside for sanatorium benefit must be made available, as to a certain proportion, for hospital benefit, an arrangement which will have the advantage of securing that all the rest of the expenditure under both heads should be made with the fullest care so as to avoid hasty expenditure upon buildings and sanatoria provision, and the undue multiplication of such buildings, which may, and probably will, otherwise take place."</quote>
After all, sanatoria are one kind of several institutions which are already in use, and it is possible at present to eradicate tuberculosis in the same way that typhus fever, smallpox, typhoid, scarlet fever, and other pests of our population have been successfully grappled with. Therefore the object of this Amendment, and of all those which stand in my name, is to utilise the hospitals where possible for sanatoria, and to enable the insured persons to use hospitals in cases of accidents upon the certificate of a certified medical practitioner.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03595"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The object of the noble Lord's Amendment is to make institutional treatment&#x2014;that is to say, treatment in hospitals&#x2014;take the place of treatment in sanatoria. That is a
<col>1010</col>
very large principle, and if it were accepted it would upset the whole machinery of this Bill with regard to the treatment of consumption. After a great deal of discussion in the other House it was decided, on what was believed to be the best expert opinion, that the best chance of coping with consumption was to take it very early, and to treat it by giving preliminary treatment in sanatoria&#x2014;not a long treatment, but a treatment which would enable the patient to get rid of the tubercle and have a chance afterwards. What is now proposed is to treat all these cases in hospitals, and to apply the machinery, the beneficial machinery, which has been applied to sanatoria to hospitals. The effect would be to convert the existing hospitals into publicly-supported and Treasury-aided institutions. That would be one very large consequence of the Amendment. Another consequence is that the charge would be very much increased, because these institutions are to be dealt with evenly. What the financial effect would be I cannot say, but a very much larger amount than the &#x00A3;1,000,000 which the State proposes to provide would be required. Therefore I beg to say that this whole series of Amendments is not such as we are competent to consider in this House, or which any private member is competent to propose. But the difficulty that is fatal, not only to this but to all the Amendments of the noble Lord, is that they would involve a complete recasting of the whole of this part of the Bill. We should be thrown into the most complete confusion, and it would not be the same Bill if the Amendments were accepted.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Viscount said: This Amendment deals with this case. There is just a possibility that an enterprising insurance society might, particularly
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0510"/>
<col>1011</col>
in the case of a voluntary contributor, do this: let him drop out of insurance, and even encourage him to drop out of insurance, very soon after he had insured, and then when he was an old life take the reserve value. I do not wish to explain to your Lordships over again what the reserve value credited by the State to an old life is, but it is created out of the State money and not out of contributions of the insured. Consequently if it were possible to drop him out of insurance and appropriate the reserve value there would be very great temptation to the insurance society to take that course, and it is not desirable that the Bill should so provide. What we propose by these two Amendments is to except sums that are in respect of reserve value. The effect of the Amendments is to prevent societies from getting any advantage, if the insured drops out of insurance, by appropriating the money contributed by the State to make up this reserve value.</p>

The right rev. Prelate said: I am sorry that an Amendment of this kind has been left to be moved by one who has no legal training or experience, but as there is no one more competent willing to fulfil the duty I must do the best I can. I wish it also to be understood that if I say anything savouring of distrust in the Commissioners created under this Act I am not referring to Sir Robert Morant, whom I hold in the highest honour, or any of the other gentlemen whose names have been given to us. I am referring rather to hypothetical appointments which may be made by this or any other Ministry succeeding them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03650">In making law I take it we ought to try to guard against possible as well as probable mischief. The noble Viscount in charge of the Bill said that it would be in the power of the Commissioners at any moment to strike a medical man off the panel and to ruin his professional prospects. The object of my Amendment is to give the unfortunate medical man in question such protection as may be afforded by an appeal to a legally constituted tribunal already in existence. And in moving this I claim, if I cannot have his support, at least the sympathy of the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack, who feels, as he well may, an honest and increasing satisfaction in the part taken by him in founding the Court of Criminal Appeal. The subsection which I wish to amend provides that where the Insurance Commissioners, after such
<col>1020</col>
inquiry as may be prescribed, are satisfied that a medical practitioner's continuance in the list would be prejudicial to the efficiency of the medical service of the insured, they may remove his name from the list.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03651">Now let me give an example to your Lordships of the kind of case I have in mind, and which I desire to protect. A young doctor without money or interest, who has scraped up enough money to pass through the medical schools with credit, thinks he sees an opening in medical practice, and is beginning to make his way. Perhaps a hysterical woman&#x2014;both doctors and clergymen, as your Lordships are aware, are exposed to this danger&#x2014;brings a false accusation against him, and scandal arises. The case, under this Bill, is to be referred to the Insurance Commissioners. Now who are the men who would have to try the doctor, if not for his life, at least for that which to many men is dearer than life&#x2014;namely, his character and professional prospects? They are an unspecified number of Commissioners, I suppose four or five, of whom one should be a medical practitioner, who may or may not be eminent in his profession. Of course, such a man would be highly respectable and honourable in his profession, but I doubt whether the emolument would be such as to tempt a man of first-class eminence to undertake the duty. Let me take a parallel supposition. I believe that Courts of Inquiry&#x2014;at least, I gather so from what I have read occasionally in the newspapers&#x2014;are occasionally held in the Army to inquire as to the fitness of some particular officer or other to command. Let us suppose that such a Court was to sit without an appeal, composed of five civilians taken from the Civil Service and one commissioned officer, who might be of any rank whatever in the Service. Would such a Court, acting without appeal, be very satisfactory for the purpose of deciding as to whether or not any officer in the Service was fit to hold his command?</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03652">Or, again, take a case which is perhaps more common. A young lieutenant is to be tried because of some error of judgment or miscalculation of the force of the tide or current, by which he loses the vessel under his command. Five men, none of whom knows more of navigation than can
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0515"/>
<col>1021</col>
be obtained by taking an occasional run from here to Greenwich in a penny steamer, and one lieutenant, who may have been on the retired list, no one knows how long, are to decide the question as to whether that officer had fulfilled his duty or not. Lest any one should say the case is not parallel, let me remind your Lordships that the doctor I am supposing to be put on his trial can be tried equally for want of professional skill or for having made some fatal mistake in his treatment of a ease, as well as on account of such a scandal as I have suggested. Now let me go on. The Commissioners may hold an inquiry, and, if they think fit, may remove the man. They are not bound by the result of that inquiry. They may, indeed, act quite contrary to its findings if they like. Let me remind your Lordships of what took place in a Swansea case which occupied so much of your Lordships' time some while ago. There the Board of Education claimed, after holding an inquiry, the power of judging on other knowledge in their possession, and setting aside the findings of that inquiry. I appeal to those who sat in judgment on that occasion to say whether that is not a fair statement, whether that was not the very pleading urged&#x2014;that the Department had a right to act on other knowledge, and so set aside the report of their own Commissioner. In that case there was an appeal to the High Court and to your Lordships' House. There was a great deal of popular enthusiasm and indignation, and sufficient money was subscribed to support that appeal. But look at the case I am quoting of the young doctor with no money, and perhaps with local feeling against him. The Commissioners may send down, not a Mr. Justice Hamilton, but some much less capable person, and then allow the man to be condemned and found guilty on insufficient evidence, or, if found not guilty, set aside, as in the Swansea case, the finding, acting on knowledge within their possession but of which the accused has not heard. In that way they may ruin the man. It may be said that what was done in the case of a school would never be done in the case of a person. But is that quite sure? I know something of inquiries in cases of local scandal. Public feeling sometimes condemns a man first and then insists that an acquittal is a failure of justice, and the pressure brought to bear on such a tribunal as the Commissioners would not be slight.</p>
<col>1022</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03653">Now what is the Court to which I propose to give the right of appeal in such a case&#x2014;the General Medical Council? This was established by Act of Parliament in 1858, and its constitution was enlarged and put on a more popular basis in 1886. The Act was brought in by the Party now in power. It was backed by Sir Lyon Playfair, Mr. Mundella, and the Lord Advocate. It provides that the constitution of the, Council should consist of five persons nominated by the King, on the advice of the Privy Council, one person to be nominated by the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, and a number of other Medical Colleges and Universities, three persons elected from time to time by the registered medical practitioners of England, one elected by the registered medical practitioners of Scotland, and one by the registered medical practitioners of Ireland. Is it not reasonable that a man condemned for misbehaviour or unskilfulness in the exercise of his profession by an unspecified number of Commissioners with only one professional member among them, whose name no one knows, sitting, certainly in the case of Wales, no one knows where, acting possibly upon private unsifted information, should be allowed to appeal to this august tribunal founded by Parliament for the protection, and, if need be, the correction of medical practitioners?</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03654">My Lords, I regret that some one better acquainted with law has not attempted to discharge this duty, but I have one qualification&#x2014;my love to those whose cause I plead. Before I was called to my present office I was an ordinary common country parson, and as such I was in close association with the ordinary common country doctor. I know something of their kindness and self-denying labours. I have known them go out in all weathers amongst the suffering poor; I have known them while ministering to the suffering to relieve their poverty out of their own penury, finding often the poor have been unable to pay them anything. I know also that a measure is in contemplation to expel myself and the other Bishops from this House. If that time comes there will be no vote or speech of mine which I shall look back upon with more satisfaction than this attempt to obtain justice for those hard-working good men to whom the poor and those who work amongst them and for them owe so much.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03656"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The right rev. Prelate has travelled far from the question of this Bill into a dim and dubious future into which I will not try to follow him. I come back to the rather prosaic question which we have to discuss, which is this. As the practice of friendly societies originally stood, and as this Bill might very well have stood, the friendly societies nominated the doctors whom they employed, and the patients went to the friendly society's doctor and got his advice. The doctors objected&#x2014;and I am not at all complaining of them for it&#x2014;to being left under the old practice. Under the scheme of the Bill as it now stands there is substituted a system under which every: doctor within a given area can get himself put on the panel subject to what is recognised on all hands to be a necessary check&#x2014;a check which was necessary for this reason, that on the certificate of a doctor depends the paying of a good deal of money, and the doctor has the comfortable and uncomfortable position of having a duty to discharge to the State and at the same time a duty to discharge to his patient. This somewhat delicate question having to be considered from time to time, it was felt necessary to make some provision for revising the panel. I do not suppose it will often happen, but undoubtedly there will be cases in which it may happen, and it is one of those things which ought to be done with a good deal of local knowledge and also a knowledge of the working of this system. The Insurance Commissioners, after such an inquiry as may be prescribed, are to exercise the duty of revising the panel when that has to be done, and they are given power under Clause 66 to appoint a specially qualified referee to assist them in coming to their decision. I should have thought that was all that need be covered. I should have thought that was all that could possibly be wanted. What sort of body is the General Medical Council in a question of this kind? Something arises, it may be in a remote parish in Scotland, when; the facts are to be investigated, and where you have to send somebody down under Clause 66 to inquire into the circum-
<col>1024</col>
stances and report if there was matter or not matter for a body sitting in some central position to deal with at a distance. It is not as if it was a matter which could not be inquired into on the spot. The machinery which is here provided has been very carefully thought out and deliberately adopted.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03662"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, nothing I can say will influence the intention of the Government with regard to this clause, but before your Lordships part with it I desire to enter the strongest protest I can against the manner in which this clause has been inserted in the Bill and the position in which it leaves the matter. I do not believe, unless a special study has been made of it, that there are many men in this House who are aware of what the effect of this clause is, and I desire, if your Lordships will grant me two or three minutes, to state the position. There are some 14,000,000 people coming under this Bill. It is reckoned that there are about 15,000 doctors available to attend these 14,000,000 people, and if you divide the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0517"/>
<col>1025</col>
number of people to be attended by the number of available doctors you will find that each doctor will have nearly 1,000 patients to attend on. The average number of visits paid by the doctors of friendly societies to members of those organisations represents nine or ten a year to each member; and it is not unreasonable to estimate that the number of visits to be paid to each insured person under the Bill will represent an average of twenty annually, inasmuch as female patients&#x2014;and the attendance on female lives is estimated by doctors variously at from three to five times that on male lives&#x2014;are included and the lives generally will not represent picked lives. At the fixed fee of 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per patient a doctor would have to pay 20,000 visits a year in order to earn between &#x00A3;200 and &#x00A3;250 annually. It is a physical impossibility that the Bill can be carried out under those conditions either with due regard to attendance or with the possibility of keeping up the standard of a scientific profession or the supply in preparation for which a man has to spend five or six years of his life. In the bargains which have been made lately with the friendly societies and with other classes the subjects have been too much set on one side, and in the sudden changes in the Bill in the House of Commons it has not been generally appreciated by the public and hardly even by the medical profession how prodigious is the burden placed upon them and how impossible it is that the Bill can remain in its present condition. I know it is said that it is open to the Insurance Commissioners to take steps in this matter, but nobody knows better than the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill that their horizon must be limited by their purse and by the grants which come from the Government. I think it will be found that the Government have lighted a fire which they will not be able to extinguish, and by their procedure and by the denial to this House of the power of revision they will have contributed to a large extent towards making the operation of the Bill difficult and the recasting of certain clauses, of which this is one, imperative in the near future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03663"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in days gone past Governments have been accused of filling the butchers' shops with big blue flies and of many other things; but never before have I heard it suggested that the Government were, by a Bill they
<col>1026</col>
had introduced, likely to increase the amount of illness in the country. Yet what does the speech of the noble Viscount mean, if it does not mean that. He says there are nearly 15,000 doctors doing the medical work of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03664"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I said 15,000 doctors were available for this particular purpose. As everybody knows, we have a much larger number on the Register, but of that large number some are in practice in London as specialists, some belong to the Army and the Navy, and some are attached directly to hospitals. The actual number estimated by the medical profession themselves as being available is about 15,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03665"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Yes; but, after all, people suffer independently of this Bill, and they will suffer, I hope, not more. I trust that in the end they will suffer less after the Bill. There are doctors enough, even with these things. The doctors who deal with this class of cases do so at very moderate rates of remuneration&#x2014;much less than they will get under this Bill. Is it stated by the noble Viscount that this Bill is going to increase the number of patients so enormously that the supply of doctors will run out?</membercontribution></p>

If you divide the work which one man can perform between two, he will get &#x00A3;100 a year instead of &#x00A3;200 a year; and I venture to say, with great respect to the noble Viscount, that the method by which he has attempted to defend these clauses proves more conclusively than anything with how little thought and with what a light heart the Government have gone into one of the most difficult and most serious questions that could possibly have been raised.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03679"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD TENTERDEN</member><membercontribution>: I move to delete paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2), and I do so with the firm conviction that the majority of your Lordships are not in favour of this clause remaining part of the Bill. How the endowment of research ever came to be entered into to form part of an Insurance Bill is quite incomprehensible; but what is perfectly clear to every one is that the term "research" is a misnomer&#x2014;a cloak to conceal the horrible practices of the inoculation and vivisection of living animals. I know I shall be told that research is nothing of the kind, and that it simply means that scientific research by doctors which has been proceeding for a number of years past. If that were so, my Lords, no one would welcome its endowment more than I should, and I should net be here to move this Amendment. But unfortunately this is not so. Research as practised now invariably means vivisection in its worst form.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0519"/>
<col>1029</col>
In support of what I am saying I will call your Lordships' attention to the remarks of Mr. McKenna, when he received a deputation of representatives of antivivisection societies on behalf of Mr. Lloyd George. He admitted that if the endowment of research were part of the National Insurance Bill it could not be hoped to exclude the inoculation, and not improbably, too, the vivisection of living animals. As another instance of the fact that research means what I have said it does, there is the fact that there exists a Research Defence Society. Now it is quite clear to anybody who thinks about the matter at all that there could not exist a Research. Defence Society unless there was something to hide and to defend. Therefore if it is necessary to organise a society to defend research there is some thing going on behind the curtain which the public is not allowed to see and not allowed to understand. In the face of all this, is it not perfectly clear, if this clause is allowed to remain part of the Bill, that hundreds of thousands of people will be compelled to subscribe to the &#x00A3;60,000 endowment for purposes which they hate and detest, when they would willingly give their money to prevent it instead.<lb/>
Your Lordships must remember that this money is to come from all classes of people. You are taxing people who work very hard for their living and with whom every penny counts; and if this Bill passes your Lordships' House people are going to be compelled to subscribe to the endowment of research which include the vivisection and the inoculation of living animals when their whole spirit and mind revolt against the practice, and who no doubt, as I have said, would willingly subscribe money to prohibit any such practice throughout the nation. In 1910, out of 95,731 experiments, only 129 were seen by inspectors. From this it is clear that there is not even proper supervision, and what happened in the case of the experiments on the wretched animals which were not inspected no one knows. I should like to call your Lordships' attention to the admissions made by these very inspectors before the Royal Commission. They admitted that the experiments resulted in great and lingering suffering and sometimes acute pain for these poor defenceless animals&#x2014;well, I will leave what they say to your Lordships' imagination. No real good has ever been obtained
<col>1030</col>
from this so-called research. If any good results had been obtained from it I might not be here to move this Amendment. The results have been invariably inaccurate, inconclusive, and contradictory. If research by torturing animals must be continued, then it is amply provided for by the laboratories which exist at the present moment, and it is unnecessary to put this imposition upon the ratepayers and compel them to provide a further large sum&#x2014;as much as &#x00A3;60,000 a year&#x2014;for a purpose which does not commend itself to them. I would remind your Lordships that whenever the public have known and have had explained to them what really went on under the name of research, they have one and all condemned these iniquitous practices. It is certain that had it been possible this Amendment would have been proposed in the House of Commons. Mr. Chancellor was ready to move it, but unfortunately things were rushed through at such a rate that he was unable to get a chance of bringing the matter forward; but in a very short time he collected the signatures of sixty-two Members of Parliament to a protest against this imposition, and that protest was signed by 100,000 people outside the House of Commons.<lb/>
Let me mention to your Lordships a few of the associations that have passed resolutions against this. The London Liberal Federation, consisting exclusively of the most representative Liberal workers from all the London constituencies, passed a resolution asking for the exclusion of experiments on living animals; only four voted against it. The Women's Liberal Association passed a similar resolution unanimously. The Liberal Members of the House of Commons who moved Amendments received similar resolutions from Liberal Associations in many parts of the country. The Church Anti-Vivisection League, which has for its object the prohibition of the vivisection of living animals, of the inoculation of animals with diseases, and of the treatment of serums prepared from animals inoculated with diseases, ask your Lordships&#x2014;
<quote>"to protect the people from their nominal representatives by exercising your Veto in respect of certain unstatesmanlike clauses in the National Insurance Bill."</quote>
They add&#x2014;
<quote>"Our Empire owes its rise to our just treatment of the lower humanity; let us beware lest it owe its fall to our unjust treatment of the lower animal creation."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0520"/>
<col>1031</col>
They have passed a resolution embracing an Amendment to Clause 16 in somewhat similar terms to the one I am now moving. It reads&#x2014;
<quote>"But none of the money so provided shall be used for experiments on living animals, or for providing buildings or apparatus for the purpose of such experiments."</quote>
By this it will be seen that I have the support of the Church, I do not say the whole Church; but in any case a very large section of the Church is dead against these practices.<lb/>
If your Lordships allow this clause to pass you will be doing a great injustice to the people of this country. No doubt your Lordships remember the demonstration that took place lately in this city, when resolutions were passed at eight platforms protesting against the insertion of this clause in the Insurance Bill. That demonstration goes to prove what the feeling of the people is in regard to this matter. This is not a Party question, as I have already proved. It is one on which, fortunately, I have very large support on both sides in this House and also in the House of Commons. I maintain that if your Lordships allow this subsection to remain in the Insurance Bill, with which it has nothing whatever to do, it will be a disgrace to the nation, and not only will you perpetrate a cowardly act towards the whole animal kingdom but you will do a great injustice by taxation to a large number of your fellow-countrymen.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03681"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Strange to say, nowhere in this Bill is there a word about vivisection, nor has the provision to which my noble friend behind me has devoted so much attention anything to do with vivisection. The provision is that Parliament is to provide one penny in respect of each insured person towards the sums available for defraying the expenses of sanatorium benefit in each year. If this penny were struck out, the sanatoriums would be the first to suffer, and part of the fund for the treatment of consumptives would be gone; and why my noble friend should have moved to omit this paragraph I do not know. Lower down the word "research" occurs, and research is one of the subsidiary purposes to which what is
<col>1032</col>
left of this money can be devoted. There will probably be very little of it. But I need not say that, even on the most extravagant hypothesis, research includes a great deal more than vivisection, and if we are to be debarred from taking advantage of the enormous facilities which this Bill affords for pursuing the study of consumption, all I can say is a very great evil will be brought about. I do not pursue the other arguments which my noble friend has raised, but I might point out that this is obviously on the face of it dealing with a financial provision, a thing which is not considered to be within the competence of this House, and therefore the Amendment would be out of order. I rest my case, however, on the broad ground that it would be a disaster, for the other reason I have given, if the Amendment of my noble friend were carried.</membercontribution></p>

I shall always endeavour to bring it forward whenever I have an opportunity. As to whether or not it has to do with vivisection, I think there is sufficient evidence to show that up to the present research has always included vivisection. If I am to understand from the noble Viscount that the &#x00A3;60,000 a year is to be devoted to the purposes of sanatoria and of ordinary scientific pursuits and investigations by doctors and to those purposes only, then I am entirely with him; but if not, then I put it to your Lordships that experiments upon living animals should be excluded from the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0010P0I0521"/>
<col>1033</col>
that if we are to get good results we must take it in hand early, and the great object of my Amendment is to provide that some part of the fund in the hand of the Insurance Commissioners may be used for the purpose of education on this matter. The National Association for the Prevention of Consumption, of which I happen to be chairman, has several exhibition caravans which go about to different centres of population for the purpose of educating the people in precautionary measures. I believe that under Clause 59 there is power given to the local health committees to expend money in the direction I have indicated, but it would be, I think, of great importance if we could appeal to the discretion of the central body instead of having to go to every local authority. The only object with which I have put down this Amendment to add the words "or of education" after "research" is to give the National Insurance Commissioners power, if they see fit&#x2014;leaving it entirely to their discretion&#x2014;to give small subsidies here and there for the purpose which I have endeavoured to describe.</membercontribution></p>

The intention of the Bill was that education should be dealt with under Clause 59, which provides other machinery and other funds for the purpose. The educational objects which the noble Lord has in view should be attained in that way. I am afraid if we go beyond research here, the temptation would be to divert the very little money there is available out of this penny, which would be better devoted to the investigation of the causes of phthisis than anything else. On the whole I would ask the noble Lord not to press his Amendment. I have entirely the same object at heart as himself&#x2014;education is most important&#x2014;but, as I say, Clause 59 deals with that, and I am very anxious not to take any money away from the small amount that will be available for research.</membercontribution></p>

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has promised that all insured persons shall receive free medical attendance. It is quite clear that a man falling from a scaffold or a man who is run over by a cart and seriously injured&#x2014;as I recently witnessed in Essex&#x2014;has not time to go before a health board, and it seems to me it is necessary in such cases that he should get the quickest certificate he can to enable him to go to the best hospital.

This is one of those unfortunate clauses that were not in the Bill as originally introduced, and it has never been discussed at any stage, as I understand, in another place. There is a serious pecuniary difficulty in regard to this clause, and also a serious departure from ordinary practice. I understand&#x2014;in fact I am certain&#x2014;that it affects Scotland as well as England, because it is one of those clauses applied to Scotland by Clause 80 of the Bill. It is entirely contrary to principles that Parliament has
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0524"/>
<col>1039</col>
hitherto adopted in regard to cases where powers are conferred on county councils with regard to non-county boroughs. There are, of course, cases in England and Scotland where both county councils and borough councils are empowered to perform the same class of duties. The larger non-county boroughs are educational authorities, and they are out of the county for the purpose of the education rate. The point here is that this clause gives a power, and a very reasonable and proper power, to a non-county borough to make special arrangements with the county council for the performance of certain duties. If the non-county borough is liberally inclined, it may want to increase the medical man's fee, and to do certain things to secure better services within its own bounds; but if it once takes advantage of this clause, as the Bill stands, I am afraid it runs the risk of having to pay twice over, because it will not only have to pay the sum it agreed with the county council to pay, but it will also be liable to be rated in respect of the duty. I am sure the noble Viscount understands the point, and I will not elaborate it. I cannot move to omit the clause, because that would do great harm; but if the noble Viscount, either at this stage or a subsequent stage, would take this addition to the clause I think it would meet the case&#x2014;namely, "A county council shall not raise any sum on account of any expenditure incurred by them under this Part of this Act within any borough or urban or rural district the council of which has entered into an agreement in pursuance of this section during the continuance of such agreement."

is also clear that it should not be rated by the county council in respect of it.

The noble Earl said: If the Government are not able to accept this Amendment as it stands, perhaps they will be able to insert a few words to meet the case. I move this at the wish of the National Sea-Fishers' Protection Association, to which is affiliated practically all the sea-fishing associations in the United Kingdom. Under the Merchant Shipping Act owners of fishing vessels are compelled to make provision for any of their men who may be taken ill when they are on board, and they have to provide for medical attention during sickness. It must be remembered that these fishing vessels are very often engaged in fishing in places far distant from this country; they proceed to the coast of Iceland, to the Faroe Islands, the White Sea, and the northern coast of Morocco, and if a man is taken ill in such a place the owners of the vessel are put to considerable expense in providing for his maintenance and treatment, and also for his conveyance home. The object of the Amendment is to try and remove a grievance which I think will be found to come into existence if the Bill is passed as it now stands. We hope the Government will give permission for a scheme being prepared, which the Commissioners may accept or not, which will meet the case, so that vessels engaged in fishing operations so far distant from this country may have the same treatment as is accorded to merchant trading vessels in distant waters.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03858"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I cannot do all that the noble Earl wants me to do, but I may be able to do something. The clause as it stands is an agreed clause. It was negotiated by Sir Norman Hill on behalf of the shipowners, and they all agreed to it, and it is a very good clause. Of course, the main purpose of it is with reference to foreign-going ships. The ships that go for long voyages come under the Merchant Shipping Acts, and the benefits provided by the shipowners are larger than the benefits under the Bill, and it is quite right that there should be special treatment there. But when you come to the coasting trade it is quite different. Ships that go along the coasts to the home ports can always as easily put a man on shore as keep him on board, and the difference in cost is very great indeed. What is a heavy burden in the case of the long voyage shipowner is a mere trifle in a case of this kind, and the difference in cost between the two benefits is so slight that it would not be possible, in these cases of merely short voyages along the coast, to allow the shipowner to make special arrangements such as is permitted under the clause dealing with the longer voyages. But there are cases of fishermen going out for a considerable voyage, to the Dogger Bank, for example, and I am prepared to move an Amendment in subsection (10), after "1894 to 1907," to this effect&#x2014;" but the expression 'foreign-going ships' and home-trade ships' includes ships engaged in the sea fishing service." That will let in a certain number of these fishing boats to the scheme of the clause, but will still exclude those that merely trade along the coast.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03918"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BANGOR</member> moved, at the end of paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (2), to add the following new paragraph, "One-tenth to be appointed by the employers of the said insured persons." The right rev. Prelate said: I hope the Government will see their way, if not to accept my Amendment exactly as I have put it, to agree to something of the kind. Health committees are appointed with very considerable powers, and it is proscribed that the majority on those committees shall be elected to represent the insured persons. The committees have very great powers, and can set in motion machinery that may bring very unpleasant consequences upon the employer, and it does seem to me only fair that the employers, who are so largely interested, should have some representation. Let me quote one instance where the employer may be seriously affected. Subsection (2), paragraph (<i>a</i>), of Clause 62 provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"Where the excess"&#x2014;that is, of sickness&#x2014;" or such part thereof as aforesaid is due to the conditions or nature of the employment or to any neglect on the part of any employer to observe or enforce any such Act or regulation as aforesaid, it shall be made good by the employer."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0536"/>
<col>1063</col>
There seems to be a large avenue opened up there of serious consequences that may fall upon the employer owing to machinery set in motion by the health committees, and while I quite admit that the insured people should have a large majority, it seems only right that the employers should be represented too. This also seems to be in harmony with the intentions of the Bill, because Clause 47 in constituting the committee to deal with the affairs of the Seamen's National Insurance Society, which also has great powers, gives an equal representation to the Board of Trade, shipowners, and members of the Society. It is, therefore, I think not unreasonable to give employers some slight representation on these health committees, and I propose a representation of one-tenth, but perhaps the noble Viscount, on considering the matter, can suggest some better way.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03920"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The difficulty about the right rev. Prelate's Amendment is that it would take away from the representation, not of the insured persons, but of the county councils. As he proposes it, it would take away half the representation of the county councils and give it to the employers. Employers are not directly interested in the administration of the benefits; that is not a thing that personally concerns them; and I do not see why they should be represented on the health committees. I do see why the county councils should be strongly represented; and, moreover, I think the county councils will very often appoint persons who are employers to sit on the committee. Therefore it is better to leave the representation of the committees as mentioned in the Bill. I venture to think that the county councils would be extremely angry if we took away from their not very strong representation on the committees and gave it to those whom it may turn out will be the very people they will appoint.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1064</col>
after "members" the words "who shall consist of employers." The noble Lord said: My Amendment raises in a different form something of the same point which has just been raised by the right rev. Prelate. I agree with the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill that it would not be fair to take away from the county councils a part of their representation to give it to the employers, but it seems to me hard that the employers as a body should not have a certainty of some representation. As a class they will have to furnish a large proportion of the funds which these committees will administer. I am informed that of the whole sum, at least &#x00A3;9,000,000 out of the &#x00A3;20,000,000 will come direct from the employers as a class. They are also interested in the matters which will occupy the attention of these committees, and they are greatly concerned with the way in which these committees will exercise their powers and duties. For example, the committees will have to prepare statistical and other returns as to the health of insured persons. Under a sub Sequent clause allegations may be made seriously affecting the interests of the employers and the moneys they will have to pay, and as a class I think the employers are asking very little if they ask to be assured that some part of the representation on these committees will be allotted to them. I do not think that the actual form of the Amendment which I have put down is quite satisfactory, and I propose to move it in these words, "some of whom shall be employers." I trust that the noble Viscount will be able to accept it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03962"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a most important clause, and I would like to call the attention of your Lordships to one or two points in it. The pith of it, of course, is that if a complaint is made an inquiry shall be held by
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0539"/>
<col>1069</col>
a person to be appointed by the Secretary of State or by the Local Government Board to see how far excessive disease, so to speak, within a certain area is due to the neglect or default of the local authorities, or of any individuals; and the result of the inquiry might be, that the local authorities or individuals might be heavily penalised by the person so appointed. There is nothing whatever said as to the qualifications of the person who should conduct such an inquiry as this, which may be one imposing a very large payment towards the insurance fund upon the local authority, or indeed upon individuals. It is quite easy to conceive the possibility, in a large area like London or Lancashire, of a sum amounting to many thousands of pounds being imposed on the local authority and consequently on the ratepayers, and yet there is no appeal whatever provided in the clause. The penalty is to be imposed by a person who is only described as a "competent person." That person may be a briefless barrister of seven years' standing, or a medical practitioner without any practice and with a considerable number of fancies in his mind as to sanitation; and I think His Majesty's Government might consider whether, in the first place, the authority imposing such a penalty ought not to be a Government Department instead of an individual, and, secondly, whether there ought not to be some kind of appeal, certainly on points of law, against the result of such an inquiry. On the first point, I venture to suggest to your Lordships that the inquiry should be held as proposed, the person being appointed, as is also proposed, by the Secretary of State or the Local Government Board, and that then, if a penalty has to be imposed, it should be done on the report of the inquiry by the Government Department concerned&#x2014;either the Secretary of State or the Local Government Board. They would be responsible to Parliament for their conduct in the matter, whereas the person concerned could have no responsibility of the kind. I submit to your Lordships that this is a matter which ought not to be dealt with in the manner now proposed in this clause. My noble friend, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, at the instance of the County Councils Association, has placed an Amendment on the Paper later on providing for an appeal from the decision to two or more of His
<col>1070</col>
Majesty's Judges. I do not know whether that Amendment is one&#x2014;perhaps it may not be&#x2014;that His Majesty's Government can accept, but I have suggested in another Amendment another kind of appeal, that before any order is made the draft of the same shall be laid before each House of Parliament for a certain time, with power, of course, to annul it. The point I wish first to raise is the question of the authority which should impose the penalty. I submit to the noble Viscount that this Amendment does not in any way impede the working of the scheme, but simply provides a responsible authority to exercise the very large powers provided under this clause.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03964"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The Government have given a great deal of consideration to this question. On the one hand we wish to do what is right, and, on the other, we wish also to take care that the machinery is machinery of a workable kind. If the Amendment of the noble Viscount were carried, it would put the Minister responsible for the Department in the position of giving a judicial decision, and that is just what he is not in a position to do. In the case of a purely administrative matter that very often happens, and an Amendment such as the noble Viscount proposes would be appropriate. But in this case, you are holding a judicial inquiry into something which can only be held by a referee. It is obvious that a question of this kind, if it came before the Law Courts, would almost inevitably be referred to some barrister, I hope of good standing, or to a special or official referee, and he would go down and take the evidence and report, and practically it would be almost impossible to review his report. It is almost impossible in these cases even for a Court of Justice to review the report come to on a question of fact. Of course, if he had exceeded his powers or gone contrary to natural justice, then in the case I am describing where the Judge of the High Court has referred the matter to a referee who has gone down and reported, the Judge would set the thing aside as <i>ultra vires</i> on the part of the referee, or misconceived in the form of the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0540"/>
<col>1071</col>
procedure. But that power remains under this clause in regard to the special machinery, because the order of the person making the inquiry has not of itself any legal force until you put in operation subsection (5) of the clause, which says that "an order made by such person under this section may by leave of the High Court be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or order of the Court to the same effect." That means that you have to apply to the High Court to enforce it, and if they have any doubt about it they say, "No, bring an action."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03965"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Would the noble Viscount look at the following subsection&#x2014;subsection 6&#x2014;where the penalty may be exacted?</membercontribution></p>

There is no power to enforce it <i>in persona.</i> In the general case you have to go to the Court which gives you leave to bring an action, or to apply for a writ of <i>certiorari.</i> The kind of question here is not one which you could litigate in an ordinary Court of Justice. If you tried to do so, it would be referred to somebody, as would happen under the Bill, and the purpose of this is to make machinery which is workable. I agree that the machinery must be just, but looking to the class of case which had to be dealt with, we thought that this was the most efficacious and fair way of doing it, and it is on that footing that the Government have framed the clause. It is a footing to which they attach very great importance, and without it they think the section would be a dead letter.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1072</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03969"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I have read this clause with attention. It is, like a great many other clauses, of tremendous length and anything but simple to understand. I have also had the advantage of listening to the explanation of the noble Viscount, who is, of course, a very distinguished lawyer, but I am not sure how subsection (5) and subsection (6) are to be read together, or how they are consistent either with each other or with what precedes them. The objection taken by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, is that this immense power is given to an unknown person, a person with no official position, and there is no statement of any qualification whatever on his part. My noble friend instanced the possibility of his being a barrister without a brief or a medical man without a practice, but even those meagre qualifications are not given in the Bill. It is to be some person who is to be deemed "competent," but it does not state with clearness who is to be satisfied of his competence&#x2014;it may be the Secretary of State or it may be the Local Government, Board&#x2014;and I think the least we might expect would be some statement as to his qualifications. His powers may be immense, the liabilities under a finding of his might easily tot up to thousands, &#x00A3;20,000 or &#x00A3;30,000 or even more, and yet he may be a person without the slightest qualifications or training to guide him in deciding these intricate questions, involving listening to the most diverse, scientific evidence and I can conceive the highest expert evidence being called to prove who is responsible for the damage and whether it is traceable to anything that is curable or incurable. It is perfectly evident to anyone that this clause bristles with difficulties and with enormous risks of vast sums being imposed by way of penalty under it, and yet there is no appeal in law.<lb/>
The noble Viscount says that whatever is the finding of this competent person it is not to be carried into effect until an order is made by a Court of Law. I am glad that that is given as the legal construction of the clause as a whole. I readily accept as entitled to the highest respect any opinion given on that subject by the noble Viscount, whose eminence as a lawyer we all are glad to recognise, and I accept his statement that it is intended that the omnipotence given by the four preceding subsections is all subject to review by a Court of Law under the
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0541"/>
<col>1073</col>
fifth subsection. I do not see how it can be said that the sixth subsection follows, as what one would expect to find, upon the fifth subsection; but taking it that they are, to be read together, would it not be legitimate to put into the sixth subsection that the power given there shall be subject to the same process of review by the High Court as is mentioned in subsection. (5)? If that is intended, why not say it? Subsection (6) stands out by itself without a suggestion of appeal to any one. It is very difficult to apply our minds to it in this rapid way, but it is quite obvious that the clause should not be allowed to stand as it is now without some intimation of the kind of competent person that is to be employed. What are to be his qualifications? Is there to be a rota of competent persons? Is he to have any official <i>status,</i> like an Inspector of the Local Government Board? Is what he does to be subject to any form of official examination and approval before it is submitted to the High Court; or is his work not even to be reviewed or considered by the Department which appoints him? I accept the statement that it is intended to give to the High Court a power of review; but is it reasonable, before that review of the High Court, to allow this man to go wandering about the country giving judgments involving large sums of money, without even having his work submitted to the Local Government Board or the Secretary of State, or whoever appoints him?<lb/>
I do not wish to prolong the discussion, but it occurs to me that words should be put in, either now or at the next stage, making it absolutely plain, if there be, any room for doubt, that the power of appeal to the High Court in subsection (5) is intended to be a power that covers all the previous work of this "competent person," and enables him to be subject to a complete review in regard to all his findings under the previous four subsections; and I venture to suggest that it might be reasonable, after the explanation given by the noble Viscount opposite, that subsection (6) should have clear words put into it indicating that it is to be read in connection with, and to have the same power of review as is mentioned in, subsection (5).</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03970"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I want to add a word in support
<col>1074</col>
of the contention which has just been urged from this side of the House. There are two questions involved. First, by whom and on whose authority the person who is to make the inquiry is to be appointed and what are to be his qualifications. The other, and I venture to say quite as important, if not a more important, question is whether there is to be an appeal from his decision. We have drifted into a discussion on both these points at the same time. I want to say a word or two in support of the extreme desire for an appeal from the decision of this gentleman. I think in this matter that local authorities all over the country have been somewhat unjustly treated and their case prejudiced by the course of events in another place. Evidence was given that they had to some extent neglected their duties. But the evidence which was adduced was of old date. It may be that in the past local authorities have neglected their duties, and some of them may be in default, but you must remember that it is only very recently that powers have been given to the local authorities to take the steps which will probably be incumbent upon them in the future. Difficulties in taking these steps have been very great on financial grounds. Time after time new burdens are laid upon the rates, and promises made that, local authorities are to have assistance out of a central fund if they do their duty, but those promises have not been fullfilled; and I object to this power, apparently to be forced on the initiative of a Government Department, of penalising them in this way and subtracting from the pittances which they already possess without any appeal. The Government can collect the money they are ordered to pay at their own sweet will, and there is to be no appeal at all. My contention on this point will, of course, fall to the ground if there is to be an appeal under subsection (6) as well as under the previous one.<lb/>
On the question of expense, I believe that on balance an appeal to a properly constituted Court will save expense rather than add to it. One of the commonest arguments against appeals is that they add to the expense, and that the expense is greater than the appeal is worth; but I would point out that if you have two or three score of independent experts going about the country and holding inquiries and coming to decisions against
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0542"/>
<col>1075</col>
which there is no appeal, their decisions will form no authoritative precedent and will not be binding, whereas if you have a case or two taken to the Law Courts, in the form of an appeal the questions there decided will be decided according to the law of the country, and not according to the sweet will of the individual who is holding the inquiry, and the decision given in each case will constitute a precedent and afford guidance that may be followed in similar cases. I think I have made out my case that in this matter the giving of a power of appeal will create precedents and let people know where they are, and save expense rather than add to it, and I hope it will be given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-03971"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord who spoke last but one said he did not wish to prolong the discussion. He said that after having made what was, no doubt, a serious contribution to the debate. All of us who listened both to his speech and to the more detailed speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down, will feel that there is a great deal to be said in favour of the views which are adverse to this clause of the Bill. There is much to be said, as on many other questions, on both sides. The Government have not treated this matter lightly. It has been minutely and elaborately considered, and the Government, I am afraid, even if the discussion were ever so far prolonged, would not be at all likely to accede to the wishes of the noble Lord opposite.

I accept that, but I venture to point out to him that subsection (6) gives no such appeal, and that under that subsection any local authority can be fined and the amount deducted from money due to it from the Treasury at the instance of the Treasury and the Local Government Board, and that no appeal lies under that subsection to any Court at all.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-03987"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: This is quite unworkable. The noble Viscount proposes to put in "by leave of the High Court." The High Court has been given no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. What is done here is this. An administrative section is put in which, requires the approval of the Treasury in the event of the procedure being put in force. Then there is some kind of control by an important Government Department, I should have thought as good as the Secretary of State brought in in the way the noble Viscount proposes to bring him in. But it is not really the fact that in the one case there is an appeal and in the other there is not. As I pointed out, if, having given an order of this kind, the person appointed to inquire has travelled beyond his duty or acted contrary to natural justice, it can be reviewed. You can review an arbitrator in such a case, and if the High Court has any doubt you can bring an action or proceed by way of a writ of <i>certiorari.</i> The necessity of going to the High Court gives you an opportunity of raising the matter. In the other case where it is a question of paying money, there is still the remedy, I take it, by <i>certiorari</i>; and you have there the security of the Local Government Board and the Treasury coming in. To bring the High Court into that clause would be to bring it in in a way which would give it no jurisdiction. This is a case in which very high, and responsible persons are put in charge, and to introduce the High Court is to do what really is not only quite impracticable in working, but a thing I have never seen anything the like of in the course of my experience.</membercontribution></p>

The right rev. Prelate said: I must say I am exceedingly doubtful as to how far the appointment of these Welsh Insurance Commissioners will be acceptable to my countrymen, who are a small body. The population of Wales is only about half that of the county of Lancashire, and we are to have a special Commission co-equal with the Commission sitting in London. I hope they will be paid the same, because although it may be extravagant to pay people who attend to a population of two millions the same as those who attend

<col>1083</col>
to thirty millions, if they are not paid the same I do not think we shall get efficient people, and there must be many difficulties in the administration of the Act. I propose in my Amendment that the central office of the Commissioners should be in Carnarvon. I think we ought to have the place fixed once and for all by Parliament, and so prevent us quarrelling amongst ourselves with regard to it. Carnarvon is perhaps not as important an industrial centre as Cardiff, but I do not think that consideration would weigh, and I think on the whole it would be the right and most convenient place, especially seeing that it was specially honoured recently by being selected as the place for the Investiture of the Prince of Wales.</p>

I may say that I have intimated this and the other Amendments to the other side. I can explain to the noble Marquess what it means. It has reference simply to the appointment of the Secretary to the Board of Agriculture. The appointment as it stands now in the clause lies with the Board. It ought to be with the Secretary for Scotland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04212">(2) It shall be the duty of the Commissioner for Small Holdings to report from time to time to the Board after due inquiry what demand for small holdings exists in any district, and after consultation (where practicable) with the landlord or landlords what land (if any) is available to meet that demand, without causing undue displacement of farm servants presently employed on or about such land, under what conditions such land is cultivated, and what employment it affords.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04213">(3) Where the Commissioner for Small Holdings is satisfied that there is a demand for small holdings and that suitable land exists it shall be his duty to negotiate with the landlords of such land with a view to the adjustment of a scheme for the registration by agreement of any one or more new holders in respect of such land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04214">(4) Failing agreement, such land may, otherwise than by agreement, be made available for the registration of new holders in the manner and subject to the conditions herein-after prescribed.</p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04232">The noble Earl said: I have taken the very unusual course of proposing at this late stage of the Bill an Amendment on my own Amendment which your Lordships accepted when we were in Committee. Your Lordships will remember that on this side of the House we have maintained all along, and we are still of the opinion, that the Land Court is not a body well suited, indeed it is not suited at all, to determine whether any damage has been done in consequence of the action taken, and certainly not to determine what the amount of that damage, if there be damage,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0553"/>
<col>1097</col>
is to be. We insisted that there must be an appeal from this Court, and with that view I proposed an Amendment, which your Lordships accepted in the Committee stage, to give an appeal to the Court of Session. An appeal, of course, means two hearings&#x2014;the first hearing before the original body, and the second hearing before the Court of Appeal. We were well aware that this second hearing would involve a certain amount of delay and expense, and it was for that reason, and for that reason alone, that in my Amendment I suggested that smaller questions of damage could be left to the Land Court up to &#x00A3;400, and that anything in excess of that must be open to appeal. The Government objected to that Amendment, and I suppose I am not divulging a secret when I say that representations were made to us to see whether we could not suggest an alternative to that course. Not merely in regard to this Bill but other Bills affecting Scotland we have endeavoured to do our best to meet the wishes of the Government as far as we possibly could, and therefore in this case we suggest the alternative which now appears in my name on the Paper, and which proposes an entirely different course from that in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04233">Our proposal is to take away questions of compensation from the Land Court altogether, and place them in the hands of an arbiter to be appointed by the President of the Court of Session. This Amendment was framed for the purpose of meeting the objections of the Government. The first objection of the Government, as I understand, was that they were opposed to any law Court or other holy revising the decisions of the Land Court. In the next place, they objected to my former Amendment because they said that the Court of Session was not accustomed to deal with these cases, and they did not think that it was an advisable Court to refer the matter to, and they took further objections on the ground of the amount of delay and expense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04234">My present proposal seems to meet all these objections. It proposes an entirely different course of proceeding. It removes from the Land Court all questions relating to whether damage has been done, or how much damage has been done, and it places those questions in the hands of a single arbiter, to be appointed by the Lord
<col>1098</col>
President of the Court of Session. It is not a case of appeal at all, because an appeal means two hearings. This is a simple proceeding, and involves one hearing and one hearing only. It does not override in any way the Land Court, because the Land Court would not have the question of compensation before it. It is a cheap way and an expeditions way, and as far as I am able to judge it meets all the objections which were raised to my former Amendment by the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04235">I do not think I need trouble you by saying any more with regard to my Amendment. The details are really all reprinted, or for the most part re-printed, from the subsection as it previously stood in the Bill. But Lord Pentland proposes an Amendment in lien of mine, which I am not going to discuss in detail. I will merely take the substance of this Amendment, which is very much the same as mine, but with one very important difference. What the noble Lord proposes is that in all eases up to &#x00A3;500 these questions shall be decided by the Land Court, and that in cases which exceed &#x00A3;500 the person desiring to petition should have his choice as to whether he would appeal to the Land Court or appeal to an arbiter appointed by the Lord Ordinary. The Government will naturally say to me, "Why do you, having accepted the principle up to &#x00A3;400 of questions to be settled by the Land Court, object on this occasion to questions, which we will say are nominal, being settled by the Land Court?" My answer is perfectly simple. The two cases stand on an entirely different footing. The first case is a case of appeal. It is a case of a second hearing. We were anxious to save expense, and it was for that reason and not because we desired to place the matter in the hands of the Land Court that we said, "In these circumstances we will make this proposal, that up to a certain amount the matter shall be decided by the Land Court." But this new proposal of mine, and of the noble Lord's, too, is not a case of a second hearing. It is simply setting up one tribunal to settle once and for all these questions of compensation. When you set up this tribunal, all the reasons for making a distinction between large and small cases of compensation at once disappear. I have endeavoured to explain to your Lordships as shortly and as clearly as I can the difference between the two Amendments.
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0554"/>
<col>1099</col>
In the one case it is a question of a double hearing, and for that reason no doubt it might be desirable to avoid unnecessary delay and expense. In this case it is a question of a single hearing, and therefore I cannot see any reason whatever for drawing any distinction between cases of large or of small damages. I move my amendment.</p>

It has the differences which he points out and it has also the special difference of leaving the alternative open to the litigant to take either course he wishes. I do not intend to argue the matter, but I would appeal to your Lordships. We have, I think, shown a <i>bona fides</i> in this matter and a desire to meet the wishes of the Opposition, and if there are any details in the Amendment I have put on the Paper in which I can further approximate to the views which the majority of your Lordships hold in this matter, I shall be very glad to do my best to meet them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04238"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The point raised in the Amendments on the
<col>1100</col>
Paper is a highly controversial one, and I one with regard to which we feel very strongly on this side of the House. I cannot nevertheless help hoping, after carefully comparing the two Amendments, that they afford the material for a satisfactory arrangement between the two sides of the House. Our point of departure has throughout been our strong objection to allowing the Land Court an absolutely free hand to deal with these questions of compensation. The Land Court is in this position. It can take land either from the owner of the land or the occupier of the land, and it can distribute that land to other persons; it can fix the rent that these other persons are to pay, and under the Bill as it originally stood the Court was able to fix the amount of compensation to the dispossessed party. In our view that was highly improper. It did not seem right that a newly-created department of this kind should have both the power of dealing administratively with these questions and also of deciding judicially what amount of compensation should be paid to any one aggrieved. To meet that feeling, the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, proposed an Amendment which the House accepted. Under that Amendment, in all cases where a claim exceeded the sum of &#x00A3;400 there was to be an appeal from the Land Court to the Court of Session. We understood that His Majesty's Government entertained a very strong objection to that proposal. They objected to the Land Court being overridden by the Court of Session, and they also suggested that the procedure proposed by the noble Earl involved unnecessary expense to the litigants. Thereupon the noble Earl has put this alternative proposal on the Paper, and I must say I think he has made a very fair attempt to meet the points raised by the Government.<lb/>
The noble Earl proposes that this question of compensation should be taken out of the hands of the Land Court and handed over to a process of arbitration with which we are all familiar. Now, as my noble friend very forcibly urged, this Amendment does really meet the point raised by the Government, because instead of having two hearings and two decisions you have under his plan only one decision and one set of proceedings. I understand that the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland does not quite like that proposal, and he meets it by an alternative which I
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0555"/>
<col>1101</col>
think to a great extent does meet the requirements of the noble Earl. I understand that what Lord Pentland proposes is this, that in cases where a claim amounts to a sum exceeding &#x00A3;500, either the owner or the occupier should be placed in a position of being able to ask that the matter shall be disposed of, not by the Land Court, but by a process of arbitration, and the decision has to be given by an arbitrator appointed by the Lord Ordinary. I suggest to Lord Camperdown that he might entertain this proposal. Personally I prefer the proposal of the noble Earl. It seems to me the simplest and the most logical, but in cases of this kind the two sides of the House ought to make an endeavour to meet one another, and I think it is, perhaps, fair for noble Lords opposite to insist to some extent upon the fact that the noble Earl is in a way committed to the idea that cases of moderate amounts might be left to the discretion of the Land Court.<lb/>
I should like to add that if we did accept the Amendment of the noble Lord opposite as an alternative, there are two or three points in it which might very well be reconsidered. For example, under the Amendment a landlord or tenant is required to intimate that he desires to go to arbitration instead of having his case dealt with by the Land Court within seven days after the issue of the order. That seems to me to be a very unfair and drastic proposal. Take the case of a large tenant farmer who finds himself suddenly threatened with the deprivation of a considerable part of his holding. He, of course, will want time to consult his friends and advisers, and he very likely will want to call in a valuer. A period of seven days seems to me to be altogether unreasonable. I very much hope that the noble Lord will be able to tell us that if we take his Amendment he will be in a position to give us a longer period than seven days. Then I cannot see, if we are to accept his Amendment in principle, why the limit should be fixed so high as &#x00A3;500. The limit of &#x00A3;500 is very high, and I should have thought that a much lower minimum might have been fixed.<lb/>
There is another suggestion I should like to make with reference to the words in the last seven or eight lines at the end
<col>1102</col>
of the last paragraph on page 2 of the printed Amendments. Under the Amendment as it now stands a scheme for new holdings might be put forward by the Land Court, and that scheme might be proceeded with through all its stages. The award or order might be made, and then at the last moment the Land Court would be able to drop the whole thing. It might find that the expense was prohibitory or something of that kind, and it might decide that the scheme should not be proceeded with. In a case of that kind I think words ought to be inserted with the object of recouping any of the parties who have been put to expense in consequence of the action of the Land Court, at any rate their out-of-pocket expenses. I think the noble Lord will find that the English Small Holdings Act contains a provision designed to cover this particular point, a provision in which it is expressly laid down that where schemes have been proposed in this way and then dropped by the responsible departments the parties should be indemnified for any expense to which they may have been put. I hope the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland will kindly consider these points, and if he is able to meet us in regard to them I would advise my noble friend Lord Camperdown to accept the alternative suggested to him as being one which, not completely, perhaps, but at any rate to a material extent, satisfies the requirements he has laid down.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04239"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend Lord Camperdown has pointed out that the object of his Amendment is to meet as far as possible the objection of the noble Lord in charge of the Bill to our former suggestion of an appeal. The noble Lord has told us, and I am grateful to him for doing so, that in principle he accepts this scheme of arbitration, but I should like to point out that while he accepts it in principle he very largely destroys it by insisting upon this large limit of &#x00A3;500, below which there can be no arbitration. If the noble Lord will consider the number of cases which will come up for compensation under this Bill, he will recognise that there will be very few cases indeed over that sum. From our experience of the working of the English Small Holdings Act we know that such cases are extremely rare. I do not like to say there are none, because there may be some cases of which I do not know;
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0556"/>
<col>1103</col>
but I have never known a case of compensation where the demand has come up to that sum. If the noble Lord lays down that there is to be no arbitration under &#x00A3;500, he practically does away with the arbitration scheme altogether. I am sure that is not his wish. I believe, in accepting the principle of arbitration, he wants to give us arbitration fairly, but I am certain we are getting no advantage at all out of that concession unless we have a much lower limit than &#x00A3;500.<lb/>
My noble friend has stated quite plainly his reasons for thinking that there should be no limit at all, and I agree with him in principle. I think that logically there should be no limit, but we have gone so far in the direction of endeavouring to meet the noble Lord opposite in this matter that it would be almost ludicrous if we fell out on a comparatively small point. We have built up compromise on the top of compromise until we have lost almost everything&#x2014;perhaps not everything, but almost everything which we set out to gain. I do not want to belittle the concessions which the noble Lord in charge of the Bill has given us. He has met us very fairly, I admit, on certain matters, but we have lost by compromise, as I have said, a vast amount of what we went out to gain. But it would be foolish on both sides if we refused at this moment, at this very late hour, to accept a reasonable settlement of this matter. The noble Lord encourages me to say this because he has recognised that we do approximate very closely to one another in this matter, and he tells us that he is perfectly prepared to consider any matter of detail. I hope he will consider this limit a matter of detail. I think it is, and I hope he will be able to propose to us a limit which we on this side of the House will be able to accept.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04240"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to strike a discordant note, but I entirely disapprove of the proposal which is now made. It may be that I am powerless to resist it, but there is all the difference in the world between arbitration and a Land Court. The whole argument the other night of the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack, of the Secretary for Scotland, and of the Lord Advocate in another place, was to the effect that arbitration had been successful in these matters from 1845 down to the present
<col>1104</col>
time. Arbitration has been successful, but for this reason&#x2014;that those who were concerned in arbitration, whether landlord or tenant, have had the right to agree upon the individual to whom they will submit their case; they have, as a rule, agreed, and if they have not agreed they have, at any rate, agreed to accept his award. That is a wholly different thing from being put at the absolute discretion of a body of men over whom they have no control. From their decision there is to be no appeal, and the whole argument which is drawn from the success of the previous Acts, either of the Agricultural Holdings Act or any other Act, is beside the point which we are deciding to-day. I entirely approve of the Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown. If he would go to a Division I should be glad to support him, but I know perfectly well that he is not going to do so. I have probably no power of stopping what is going on, but this is one of the most fatal moves that, in the whole of my experience, has ever been made in the interests of the best class of agriculturists in Scotland, and I shall continue to protest against it in any way that I have power.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04241"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: If, by your Lordships' leave, I may say a word in response to what has been said by noble Lords opposite on the Amendments which are before the House, I will attempt to place before you the position of the Government. As noble Lords know well, the Government are not in a position to command a majority in this House, and therefore it will not be my suggestion that the Government should prolong the proceedings to-night by taking divisions on any of these detailed points, and I should greatly hope, in view of the conciliatory spirit which I think is present on both sides of the House, that we might be able to adjust this matter. I assure your Lordships, on behalf of the Government, that there is every desire to meet the views which have been expressed in regard to these Amendments. I will not weary your. Lordships by arguing this matter of principle. You are well aware of the position which the Government have taken up throughout and which we still hold, but I do wish to respond to the suggestion which has fallen from the noble Marquess, and to say that if he should succeed in advising the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, to accept my Amendment as the basis for a settlement of this question,
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0557"/>
<col>1105</col>
I see no difficulty whatever myself in meeting him upon the points already enumerated by the noble Marquess.<lb/>
I will mention them if I may. In the first place, there is the question of the notice, which is seven days in the Bill. I do not know whether fourteen or twenty-one days would meet the views of your Lordships. Shall we say twenty-one days? [The MARQUESS of LANSDOWNE: Hear, hear.] Then comes the question of the amount of the limit. I regret extremely any reduction of the amount of the limit, for the reasons which I have stated on former occasions, but I do not wish to stand out on the amount, and if your Lordships wish &#x00A3;400, or &#x00A3;300, instead of &#x00A3;500, I am not going to stand out on a point of that kind. The Government, I assure your Lordships, are anxious to meet you, except on matters of principle where they feel they cannot give way. There is another Amendment which the noble Marquess desired, and that is that the matter of expense should be met in the case of a scheme which is ultimately dropped by the Board of Agriculture. The noble Marquess suggested that it was hardly fair that an owner should be put to the expense of his part in the proceedings and that at the close, and perhaps after hearing the award for compensation, the Board of Agriculture should withdraw from the scheme. The noble Marquess suggested that the owner should be indemnified for the costs to which he had been put in this respect. I am, quite ready to meet your Lordships in that matter, and I have had a clause drafted which I believe meets that demand.<lb/>
There is one other suggestion I should like to make, and that is that after the word "and" in my Amendment ["to be settled by arbitration instead of by the Land Court, the same shall be settled accordingly; and"] these words should be inserted, "at any time within fourteen days after the said intimation." I think that will make this a more complete scheme. I am advised that we must have some limit of tim3. I do not adhere strictly to the proposed limit of time, but I think fourteen days gives ample time considering that it follows on twenty-one days, and I do not anticipate that your Lordships will take any objection to that. I hope I have made the position of the Government quite clear, and I assure your
<col>1106</col>
Lordships that we are very anxious not to delay proceedings beyond a reasonable limit. May I mention one further point? This is Third Reading, and it is, of course, the only stage which we have left for the consideration of this Bill in this House. There are, of course, objections&#x2014;the noble Lord opposite has drawn attention to them&#x2014;to inserting at this stage Amendments which are not on the Paper but it would be a great convenience if your Lordships would allow such Amendments as we agree to to be inserted at this stage, without prejudice to any verbal Amendments which may be made elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>

Your Lordships will remember that a saving of leases was introduced into the Bill. I wish, first, to remind your Lordships that there is no such saving in the English Act passed three years ago. The saving was introduced into this Bill because of the fear of the tribunal, of the inadequacy of the compensation, and injustice and so forth. I think for the real working of this scheme the whole of this subsection should go out of the Bill. But there is objection to that. I am very anxious to meet the views of the Opposition in this matter, and to reduce our differences
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0559"/>
<col>1109</col>
to the lowest possible degree. We have a tribunal which, I think, satisfies us. We have a compensation which satisfies us, and therefore everything really has been done which should reassure us and put us in the position of the English Act, in which there is no such saving. I do not even ask your Lordships to do that. But I do ask, so far as the crofting counties are concerned, that my Amendment should be inserted for this reason. At present there is no restriction, so far as the currency of leases is concerned, upon the power of the Crofters Commission to make enlargements; and if there is a distinction drawn between making enlargements and making new holdings, I have only to remind you that we have now provided a compensation and a tribunal and so forth to meet that difference between enlargements and new holdings. From what I have said your Lordships will see that if you do not allow current leases to be open to the operation of this Bill&#x2014;that is to say, leases from 1906 onwards&#x2014;you are actually going back on the crofting counties, and you are depriving those counties of opportunities which they have at present under the 1886 Act. I have, I hope, shown your Lordships that I have gone as far as possible to meet the objections on this score. I have confined myself simply to continuing the existing state of things and preventing this Act taking a backward step.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04282"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I view with real regret the noble Lord's intention to reverse the decision to which this House came on a previous occasion. I have always viewed the substitution of arbitration for the Land Court in fixing rents under Clause 32 as of the greatest, importance. I know that it was the only method which in any way reconciled my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh to the provisions of this clause. He thought, as we all did, that the powers to which this clause referred should have been left out of the Bill altogether, but the noble Lord refrained from opposing the clause in Committee because the system of arbitration was adopted. But I am bound to say that this system of arbitration was shorn of almost all its value by the refusal of the noble Lord to accept Amendments which subsequently moved. I explained my views in. Committee at some length, and do not want to trouble you further on the point, except to say this, that the result of the clause which provides that the Land Court shall pay the remuneration of the arbitrator only in cases where that Court, itself appoints him is absolutely destructive of all form of mutual arbitration. I feel quite certain that, under ordinary arbitrations under the Holdings Act, the better method of agreement between the landlord and the tenant as to who should be the arbiter to settle matters in dispute between them will be destroyed by the decision to pay the remuneration of the arbitrator only in cases where they have failed to come to an agreement, and to make them pay the remuneration in those cases where they have agreed upon the arbitrator. This will practically take away the whole value from the system of arbitration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04283"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The special pleading of the noble Lord opposite does not reconcile me to the abandonment of our Amendment. As long as the House understands what it is doing, it is for the House to decide; but by the abandonment of our Amendment Parliament will be allowing, for the first time, a landlord who has done his duty and carried out the whole of the improvements upon the holding, to be put in the same category as the man who has done nothing. The basis of the Crofter Act and the Irish Land Act was that the tenant acquired an interest in the holding by doing improvements of a permanent nature. That was a reasonable and legitimate ground for giving him
<col>1114</col>
an interest, and that could only be decided by an independent tribunal. But in this case, for the first time, you are giving to the tenant who has done absolutely nothing for the permanent improvement of the holding, who has come in for a period of years only under a lease, an interest which in course of time will grow, and must grow into that dual interest which has been the curse of Irish land. So long as the House knows what it is doing, I have nothing to say; but that it should do it with its eyes open, and only with its eyes open, is the object of my making these remarks. For the first time you are giving to a tenant an interest which he has not acquired, to which he has no moral or equitable right, and you are giving it to him by Statute. To my mind, there is no distinction&#x2014;and that has been admitted by the Lord Advocate in another place&#x2014;there is no logical distinction between what is above and what is below &#x00A3;50. There is no logical distinction between the man who holds a lease and the man who does not hold a lease. You are in principle and in fact breaking down by this action to-night the whole distinction which has hitherto been preserved. You are giving to the man who has come in temporarily and done nothing at all precisely the same right as if he had earned and paid for a permanent interest in the holding. I know I stand alone, but I make a most earnest -and respectful protest against the course which is proposed to be pursued.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04284"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I entirely agree with the noble Lord who has just sat down upon the question of principle, and indeed, unless I am mistaken, in the debate on the Second Reading I used arguments very closely resembling those he has just used in regard to the proposal of the Government to create this new category of statutory small tenants. They are, as he truly said, tenants who <i>ex concessis</i> have not executed their own improvements, but the improvements have been executed by the landlord. I suggested the other day that there was no sufficient reason for giving them what, in the language of the Irish Land Act, we call fixity of tenure and fair rents, but if the House was disposed to insist upon that view our proper course I think, would have been, either to have thrown out this Bill on Second Reading, or to have expunged from it the whole of the sections dealing with statutory small holdings. We have
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0562"/>
<col>1115</col>
not done that, and now we are simply called upon to decide between a form of words inserted in the Bill by my noble friend Lord Clinton, and an alternative form of words proposed by the noble Lord in charge of the Bill. Let me point out that, although there is a great deal to be said for the form of words now in the Bill, they do not have the effect of precluding the statutory small tenant from getting a fair rent fixed or getting a perpetuity of tenure. The difference between the proposal of my noble friend Lord Clinton and the proposal of the noble Lord in charge of the Bill is that in the one case the thing is done by the Land Court and in the other case it is done by agreement. With Lord Clinton's Amendment the Bill would still be open to the indictment of my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh.<lb/>
Now to come to the proposal of Lord Clinton. The author of that Amendment has risen in his place to-night to tell us that, after examining the question carefully, he has come to the conclusion that his words, without other alterations in this part of the Bill, would really not produce the desired effect. If that is the view of the author of the Amendment, I cannot be more courageous than he is, and therefore I think he is probably well advised not to insist upon it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04296">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04297"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill which I have the honour of submitting to your Lordships for Second Reading is only a part of the original and more ambitious legislative proposals which engaged the attention of Parliament in another place this session. In fact, it contains only those clauses, upon which there was general agreement in another place, and with the exception of a few Amendments of a more or less formal and drafting character which it will be necessary to move to give effect to those agreed points, I do not think it presents anything of a character which need engage your Lordships' attention very long. Both Parties are committed to legislation on this subject. The Act of 1892 and the amending Act dealt with the hours of young persons serving in shops, the Act of 1899 provided for seating accommodation for female shop assistants, and the Act of 1909 dealt with the question of early closing. It is, I think, common ground between the two Parties that shop assistants are a class the nature of whose occupation calls for the attention of Parliament, and I do not think it is necessary for me to labour the principle on which this Bill rests, nor to cite any instances to recommend it to your Lordships. Though this Bill is really only a fragment of the larger measure&#x2014;the limitations of the hours to sixty per week, the Sunday closing provisions, and the seating and ventilation clauses have been dropped&#x2014;there remain four important provisions which vitally affect the health and leisure of, I believe, about 2,000,000 shop keepers and shop assistants. The first provision, which is to be found in Clause 1, gives to shop assistants one half holiday a week, the holiday beginning at half-past one in the afternoon. The second provision allows intervals for certain meals&#x2014;this is dealt with in subsection (2) of the first clause and also in the Schedule. Then there is the provision for the closing of shops on one half day in each week, so as to give the shopkeepers themselves the benefit of a half holiday. The fourth provision, which is contained in Clause 3, has the effect of facilitating the early closing movement provided for in the Act of 1904.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0563"/>
<col>1117</col>
I will say one word with regard to the application of these provisions, and in this connection I hope your Lordships will notice the elasticity with which the application of these principles is carred out. Your Lordships will see that by proviso (<i>a</i>) of Clause 1 the provision with regard to the half-holiday is not to apply to the week preceding a bank or public holiday or any day of public rejoicing or mourning if the shop assistant is not employed on that day and if on one week day in the following week in addition to that day the employment of the shop assistant ceases not later than half-past one o'clock in the afternoon. And proviso (<i>b</i>) states that where it is the practice for a shop assistant to enjoy an annual holiday of not less than two weeks on full pay the weekly half-holiday may be cancelled during four months of the year. With regard to meals different intervals are allowed. By the First Schedule in-boarders are given three-quarters of an hour and twenty minutes for dinner and tea respectively, whereas out-boarders have an hour and half-an-hour respectively for those meals.<lb/>
By Clause 2 you will see that it is left to the local authority, by order, to fix what day the shops shall be closed, and they are permitted to fix either the same day for all shops, or different days for different classes of shops, or different days for different periods of the year. That is a provision the elasticity of which I think is commendable. Then it is further provided that if the half-holiday was fixed for a Saturday the shop keepers may decide upon another day for the half-holiday instead; or if the day fixed is not Saturday, then the shopkeepers may, by reversing it, have Saturday as the half-holiday. Then there is a further provision which allows the shopkeepers to practically contract out of this clause, and it is left to the local authority to decide whether exemption shall be granted either wholly or in part under the provisions of this clause. In order to do that, they have to satisfy themselves that a majority of the shopkeepers are in favour of this exemption. Then subsection (5) extends this exemption to holiday resorts. Moreover, there are a great number of exemptions from the provisions of the half-holiday and from the closing of shops: refreshments, intoxicating liquors, perishable articles, like provisions and tobacco,
<col>1118</col>
motor accessories, and, of course, the Post Office.<lb/>
Then, coming to the other provisions to which I alluded&#x2014;that of assisting and facilitating and giving a certain stimulus to the early closing movement&#x2014;your Lordships will see that by Clause 3 the Secretary of State, on the representation of a local authority or a joint representation from a substantial number of occupiers of shops and shop assistants is entitled to appoint a suitable person to go down into the locality and promote early closing in the district. The fact is, as your Lordships know, that although the Act of 1904 gives power to close shops at an earlier hour than usual, it is very difficult to give effect to the Act. In fact, it appears that there is a great need for someone outside and rather standing above the district, to focus public opinion on the subject, to dispel the local jealousies which may exist, and the mutual distrust which is common enough between shopkeepers who are rivals in the same business. It is thought that the appointment of a person of this kind who can act the part of a conciliator might do a lot to assist in bringing about early closing where, just for the want of sympathy and assistance in bringing them together, very often the early closing movement comes to nothing. He will be empowered to hold an inquiry, and, if he thinks fit, to submit a scheme, and that scheme will be regarded as a <i>prima facie</i> case for the early closing movement.<lb/>
The Bill applies to Ireland in rather a modified form. The terms of the clause relating to Ireland are no less favourable to shopkeepers and shop assistants there than in England or Scotland, but they are more applicable to local conditions. In fact, early in the session, before the Bill assumed its present shape, an arrangement was come to between the representatives of the liquor trade on the one hand and the assistants serving in licensed premises on the other. That arrangement is satisfactory to both parties, and as it does not place them in a worse position than they would enjoy under the Act it is thought wise to let that arrangement stand. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1119</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04299"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord has intimated, this Bill has fallen into the category of those Bills which are now called agreed Bills. As such, I am certainly not prepared to raise any objection to it. At the same time I hope that the agreement which has been arrived at in the House of Commons will be extended outside as well, because from indications which I have already seen, there will be little prospect of agreement outside. I am anxious, in order to facilitate business and clear the atmosphere on a very small point to some extent, to call attention to one rather unfortunate incident. As your Lordships are aware, the Shop Hours Act of 1899 regulates the hours of employment, and that Act is administered by the London County Council. The Shop Hours Act of 1904 provides for the closing of shops, and that is administered by the local authorities. In the case of London, outside the City it is administered, of course, by the borough councils. This present Bill deals not only with the regulation of hours, but also extends the provisions for early closing. The unfortunate occurrence to which I have to call attention is connected with this. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill informed us quite correctly that it was considerably altered between the time that it passed through Grand Committee and the Report Stage in the House of Commons. A Home Office Paper was issued consisting of two parts&#x2014;a copy of the Bill as passed by the Standing Committee, showing Amendments on Report; and a copy of the Bill as it would be if so amended, and under which, in the case of London, outside the City of London the authorities for working the Bill were the borough councils. But I am told that by an unfortunate inadvertence on the part of the draftsman a very important proviso was omitted, and the administration of the Act outside the City was transferred from the borough councils to the London County Council.<lb/>
Any of your Lordships who are familiar with these questions which have for some time been argued as between the borough councils and the London County Council will know what that unfortunate omission means. I am sure that in the work now falling upon them the Government draftsmen have the ready sympathy of this House, but this omission is a very important one, and I am bound to point out
<col>1120</col>
that if the effect of this reversal had been fully appreciated and known it is extremely doubtful whether the Bill could have been treated as an agreed Bill. I have therefore to ask His Majesty's Government whether they still adhere to the view expressed by the revised edition of the Bill, or whether they are prepared to consider the question of restoring the administration of the Act in the case of London outside the City to the borough councils. The matter is one of considerable importance, and one to which the borough councils attach the greatest importance. If I am correctly informed, the borough councils are to some extent apprehensive, from threats which have been used elsewhere, that considerable alterations may be made in the government of London which may tend to a diminution of the work carried out by the borough councils. That does not necessarily arise on this Bill. But it is a most unfortunate thing that the borough councils, who had every reason to anticipate from the White Paper which was produced that they would be placed in the position which they desired to be placed in, should find their hopes dashed in this way. I do not intend to press the matter at this stage, but I understand that my noble friend Lord Malmesbury proposes to place an Amendment on the Paper which will afford the Government an opportunity of expressing their views on the matter. And in the event of their deciding to adhere to the London County Council as the authority for London, we shall be prepared to forego Our resistance and let the whole responsibility of depriving the borough councils of what is a perfectly legitimate power rest upon the shoulders of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04300"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: With the permission of the House I will say a word on the point raised by the noble Duke.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04302"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: In the House of Commons on the Report stage the House was in possession of the fact that it was not the intention of the Government to go back from the position they had taken up all along not to introduce the borough councils as the authority. I do not think there was any doubt in the House
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0565"/>
<col>1121</col>
or in the mind of anybody as to what the Intentions of the Government were. There was nothing to conceal. The noble Duke used the words "alter" and "reverse," as if this was a change of policy on the part of the Government. As a matter of fact, I am given to understand that when this Bill was debated in Committee the position of the Government was clearly stated. No Amendment was moved in Committee to make the borough councils the authorities. I know that no Amendment was placed on the Paper before the Report stage with a view of getting them made the administration authorities, and I know that no Division was challenged on the Report stage on this question. Therefore I do not understand how the noble Duke can use the words he did as describing the policy of the Government. On the merits of the question, it seems to me that when you come to the application of early closing orders, it is perfectly clear that a borough authority is not the one to entrust with this Act&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04303"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: The borough councils have now the power of administering the orders for early closing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04304"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Yes; and the fact that early closing has proceeded so slowly and to such a small extent proves the difficulties under which they labour. The noble Duke will see that the mere question of boundaries is an almost insuperable objection to applying an early closing order. If a street divides two authorities, it is clear you cannot apply an early closing order to one side of the street only. It is for that very reason that the Government consider that the borough authorities are not the best authorities to administer the Act and believe that if the London County Council administer the orders the early closing movement will make much greater strides in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<title>METROPOLITAN POLICE RATE BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04340" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04341">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04342"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is for the purpose of increasing the limit of the rate which may be imposed by the Secretary of State for police purposes in the metropolitan area. The present limit is 9<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;, and that was fixed by the Act of 1868. It is found that there is not enough money to pay for the cost of the police force in the metropolitan area. The fact is that some considerable additional expenses have been thrown upon this fund of late. In the year l909 a Select Committee of the House of Commons reported in favour of a weekly rest day for the police force, and that is being given effect to and is estimated to cost &#x00A3;180,000 a year. There is a further item of expenditure&#x2014;the new scale of pay which is now given to the police, which is estimated to cost &#x00A3;80,000 a year. Your Lordships will remember that in August last, after the strikes and the serious additional tasks which were imposed upon the police force, it was generally agreed, both inside and outside Parliament, that
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0567"/>
<col>1125</col>
the police should be put on a new and better scale of remuneration. Then there is the general growth of expenditure owing, in the first place, to the growth of the police force in comparison with the population of the metropolitan area, a consequence which your Lordships will see is bound to arise in the metropolis of any country. The growth of population, the number of foreigners who come here, the amount of duties cast upon the police in regulating the traffic, and other things, must lead to an increase in the police force. Then there has been the rise in the price of commodities, of which we have heard a great deal of late, and the general increments which have to be met.<lb/>
It may be said that this growth of expenditure ought to be met out of the resources at present at the disposal of the Secretary of State, and so, no doubt, it would have been, were it not for the fact that, unfortunately, the rateable value of the metropolis, which for many quinquennial periods has always risen to a considerable extent, shows in this quinquennial period a tendency to decrease. Ten years ago the increase in the valuation of the metropolitan area amounted to no less than &#x00A3;2,000,000. Five years ago the increase was &#x00A3;1,500,000. This year the quinquennial valuation shows that the rateable value of the metropolis has decreased by &#x00A3;350,000. That may be regrettable from one point of view, but from others it may have its compensations. It is owing to that fact that the Secretary of State finds it necessary to ask Parliament to give powers to increase the limit of the rate for police purposes. I understand that some objection is taken to the fact that this Bill is brought before your Lordships, indeed before Parliament, so late in the session; but as many of the items of additional expenditure did not arise until late in the year&#x2014;for instance, the new scale of pay did not come into existence until August&#x2014;and there has been a change in the office of Secretary of State for the Home Department, which of course has occasioned some delay, your Lordships will see that it was not easy to introduce this Bill at an earlier stage in the session. The Bill was issued on the 7th of this month, and read a second time in the House of Commons on the 11th, and I understand that the London County Council, who, I believe, are interested in this Bill, have already had an opportunity
<col>1126</col>
of discussing it. At any rate a committee of the London County Council discussed this Bill last week. Therefore although the Bill is produced late, it cannot be said that Parliament and those concerned have not had ark opportunity of considering the provisions.<lb/>
Let me also say that there is considerable urgency in regard to this Bill. If the new rate is to be imposed, the borough councils must know early in February what that rate is. If they do not get the information then there will be considerable confusion, if indeed it will be possible for them to issue the new rate that will be needed. It must be admitted that this Bill throws a considerable burden upon the ratepayers of the metropolis, and so it must be until there is a general remodelling of the system of Imperial subventions to local taxation. Your Lordships will probably remember that that formed the subject of an inquiry by a Royal Commission, and I believe the Report is of a rather voluminous character; so much so that it has been thought necessary to appoint a Departmental Committee, and that Committee is sitting at the present time. I think, therefore, that the provisions of this Bill may fairly be regarded as being temporary and provisional, and that the last word on the question of rating and Imperial contributions is not spoken by this Bill. The fact that this is a provisional Bill is proved by the proviso, to which I will draw your Lordships' attention. The proviso in the first clause provides that. I he local authorities are to be relieved of any obligation to contribute in respect of the additional rate which is here proposed. Your Lordships are aware that under the Local Government Act of 1888 local authorities are obliged to make contributions out of the funds they derive from the Exchequer towards the total cost of the police. The rate is 9<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;, and the contribution of the local authorities is 4<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;. The proviso to which I have referred establishes that their contribution is to remain the same. This proves that the whole Bill is rather of a provisional character, because otherwise they would naturally be expected to contribute the same proportion as before.<lb/>
I may say that the sum of money required in order to carry on next year is about &#x00A3;220,000. It is estimated that a penny in the &#x00A3;1 will produce &#x00A3;233,000. If
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0568"/>
<col>1127</col>
that is so, perhaps your Lordships will ask, "Why do you ask for 2<i>d.</i> additional, instead of only a penny?" In the first place we have to think of the future. There is the increase of ordinary expenditure due to the ordinary growth of population, and then there is the rateable value. There is the fluctuation in the Exchequer contributions account, and the frequent shortages which the police fund has had to submit to on this item. And then one always has to think of the possibility of emergencies, strikes, or anything of that kind, which throws great additional expense on the police fund. But I am authorised by the Secretary of State for the Home Department to say that he only intends to impose a penny additional rate this year, and that he will not go further than a penny rate without giving the House of Commons an opportunity of discussing the whole question upon his salary. Further than that, he will make a personal investigation into the whole question of police finance with a view to seeing whether the expense can be reduced in the future and what contribution can be made by the Exchequer to meet it.<lb/>
I am aware that this Bill has aroused opposition in some quarters. I hope that opposition will not be pressed, because if this Bill does not go through it will not be possible to go on recruiting the additional police necessary to give effect to the weekly day of fest which has been approved of in another place and promised to the police. If noble Lords insist in their opposition to this measure they must take the responsibility for that weekly rest day being, in effect, cancelled. I hope, indeed, that on reflection the opposition will not be pressed in view of the pledge which the Secretary of State has authorised me to make and in view of the circumstances generally surrounding the Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04344"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the state of this House surely illustrates the extraordinary conduct of the Government with regard to this measure. I do not think any measure has ever been introduced into Parliament in which such scant feeling has been shown for the ordinary laws of representation. This measure involves a charge on the London ratepayers of about &#x00A3;460,000 a year. It was intro-
<col>1128</col>
duced into the House of Commons last week for Second Reading at half-past two in the morning, and the next stage was taken on the following day at, I believe, between two and three o'clock in the morning, and no opportunity what ever has been given to the London County Council to discuss this matter. I had the honour of waiting on the predecessor of the present Secretary of State, who promised in terms that he would give substantial assistance, if he could induce the Treasury to increase their contributions, towards this police fund, but he also distinctly said that no further operations were to be taken without consulting the London County Council. The London County Council has not been consulted, and this matter has never been before the council. It has been discussed by one committee of the council but not by the other, which takes serious objections to it.<lb/>
Our view of the finance differs entirely from that of the noble Lord. The noble Lord spoke on the assumption that this House was seized with the objects of this Bill. The House of Commons was not so seized. On the contrary, those who carried on the negotiations between the two Parties were assured that the rest day to the police could not be given unless this Bill was put into operation. That is, according to the London County Council, not the fact. The rest day to the police has been given; an extra day has been given. We are prepared to maintain and pay our fair share, but we are not prepared to take on our shoulders the whole responsibility. The system was that the Government should pay half the charge of the metropolitan police, and the London County Council the other half. In the last few years there has been a great increase of expenditure, and at this moment the charge, instead of being 50 per cent. equally, is 58&#x00BD; per cent. on the London County Council and 41&#x00BD; per cent. on His Majesty's Government. It is now proposed, at one stroke, to raise the rate by 2<i>d.</i> We contend that no more than &#x00A3;50,000 is wanted; yet by this Bill we are to be liable to have the Secretary of State swoop down upon us at any, moment and raise a further &#x00A3;460,000 a year. After all, the ratepayers of London have some right to consideration in this matter, and, late as it is, I must trouble your Lordships to divide on this Bill unless I get some satisfactory pledge with regard to it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0569"/>
<col>1129</col>
There is no cause whatever for going beyond an extra penny rate in the present conditions. The total charge which is anticipated by the London County Council next year in excess of the present year is &#x00A3;190,000, and the surplus raised by levying a rate of 9<i>d.</i> at the present time is &#x00A3;196,000. I am instructed that we can pay the whole of these extra charges for the rest day of the police and for the extra wages without jeopardising in any way the state of the fund, and we maintain that we have a right to wait until the Royal Commission's Report has been considered by the Departmental Committee. The Royal Commission recommended that 50 per cent. should be borne by the ratepayers and 50 per cent. by the taxpayers, and until that has been considered by the Departmental Committee we object most strongly to any Parliamentary action being taken except in concurrence with the London County Council. Here we are in the last two days of the session. If we are in difficulties it is clue entirely to the action of the Government. They knew this question would require settlement, they have known it for the last four or five years; they have chosen to give us five days. They introduce the Bill at the last moment, carry it in a small house, and invite your Lordships' assent to it at the close of business, with only one more day of the session to go. There are members of the London County Council who attend more than 500 committee meetings in the year, sometimes sitting more than ten times in a week in order to get good administration and avoid adding a halfpenny to the rates; yet we are now, by a process which is taken entirely out of our hands, to be mulcted to the extent of a further 2<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;1 without any power whatever of objection. I have had some communication with the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, and he was good enough to make me an offer that the Secretary of State would only raise a penny at present and would not raise the other penny without allowing a discussion on his salary. That is no concession whatever. Everybody has the right to raise a discussion on a matter of that sort on the Secretary of State's salary. And after three or four hours' debate the Secretary is in a position to closure it, and the whole thing would then terminate without possibly even a definite vote in the House of Commons. That is by no means satisfactory.<lb/>
<col>1130</col>
I desire very much to avoid moving the rejection of the Bill. In several measures which have passed the House&#x2014;in one which passed the House this session&#x2014;it was required that the Act should not be put in operation until a substantive Motion had been moved and carried in both Houses. I do not here say both Houses of. Parliament, but do ask that if the Secretary of State, who cannot possibly for some years to come require more than a penny rate, desires to raise the other, he should give a pledge that a substantive Motion shall be moved in the House of Commons and carried before any portion of that further penny rate is applied to the service of the police. I ask that as a representative of the greatest financial body, except the House of Commons, existing in this country. We&#x2014;the London Comity Council&#x2014;have a revenue of &#x00A3;10,000,000; we have great difficulty in carrying out our services; and to add at one stroke nearly half a million pounds, against the pledges of the former Home Secretary, against precedent, against the advice of the Royal Commission, and against the understanding on which this was carried through the House of Commons last week is, I think, straining a power which the Government would do wisely to avoid, especially when they are in contact with the representatives of the ratepayers of this great metropolis. I have done all I could by personal influence in the last few hours since I first heard that this question would be brought up to induce the Government to make some concession to this feeling. I am absolutely without power of consulting those with whom I act, except those who happen to be members of this House, and they are at one with me. Therefore unless I receive the pledge I ask for I shall be forced to press an Amendment that this Bill be read a second time this day three months.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04346"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must support the protest of the noble Viscount. Here is a Bill which was passed through the House of Commons in the early hours of the morning. The noble Lord in charge of tine Bill said that it was required in connection with the recent increase effected in the pay of the police and the extra expense involved in the one day's rest in seven. The noble Lord also informed us that the total amount
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0570"/>
<col>1131</col>
which would be required was &#x00A3;188,000. We are all in favour of giving these privileges to the police; they are well deserved. But a penny rate represents &#x00A3;230,000, and I maintain, as did the noble Viscount, that there is no chance of the whole of a 2<i>d.</i> rate being required in all probability for many years. The noble Lord contended that the rejection of this Bill would prevent the one day's rest in seven being given. How can that be the case? It is difficult to give the exact figures, but a 9<i>d.</i> rate produced a surplus of over &#x00A3;150,000 this year. It may be said that that surplus is required in connection with the pension fund, but may I remind the noble Lord that separate rating powers are given for the purpose of meeting deficiencies in the pension fund. I know that the cost of that fund is increasing. That is another reason why we should hesitate very much before adding 2<i>d.</i> to the statutory rate. The pension fund in 1902 was &#x00A3;139,000; it is now &#x00A3;282,000, and according to the actuarial estimates it will very soon be &#x00A3;500,000. That is all the more reason why the representatives of the ratepayers ought to have had a chance, which they have not had, of considering and discussing the proposals of His Majesty's Government. This Bill was put through before the London County Council had any opportunity of expressing their views or even considering the matter.<lb/>
It surely cannot be necessary to pass this Bill in its present form, placing a burden of nearly half a million on the ratepayers. If the whole of that money is required at least we ought to know the purpose for which it is to be raised. I do not want to throw out this Bill, but I would remind the noble Lord that, after all, if he refuses to meet us and we reject this Bill, it is open to him to put a new Bill through again in February, and to bring it in before the new financial year. There cannot be any need for this tremendous haste in putting this huge burden on the London ratepayers. I protest on the part of the London ratepayers, who ought to have had a voice in the matter. I was glad to hear one thing. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill said that some inquiry was to be made as to the cost of the London police. The cost of the London police is 7<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, whereas the average in the big towns all over the country is somewhere about 3<i>s.</i> Therefore
<col>1132</col>
it is more than double in London, and I would welcome any inquiry into this matter. I do hope that the noble Lord will meet us; but if he cannot I shall be compelled to support the noble Viscount, much as I dislike that course. It is absolutely necessary that this matter should be considered. A 2<i>d.</i> rate is unwarranted; there is no need for it. I trust that the noble Lord will give the representatives of the London ratepayers an opportunity of considering the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04347"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The two noble Lords who have just spoken are quite wrong if they think that the Secretary of State has any money up his sleeve and does not need the money for which he comes to Parliament. We have not got these balances of &#x00A3;190,000 and other figures that are mentioned, and if anything is needed to prove the state of the finances of the Metropolitan Police Force, noble Lords have only to look at the state of the balances to the credit of that force on March 31 of each year. In 1905, the balances at our credit were &#x00A3;541,000. By a successive depletion, owing to excess of expenditure over revenue, those balances have fallen in this year to &#x00A3;352,000. There has thus been in a period of seven years a reduction of almost &#x00A3;200,000 out of half a million, or two-fifths of the total balances in 1905. If that is true&#x2014;and those are official figures given me to-night&#x2014;it is clear that we have not got these large balances which the noble Viscount thinks we possess and which render unnecessary the proposals of this Bill.<lb/>
If we do not get our Bill the recruiting for the police force must stop because there will not be funds. The noble Viscount understands that if recruiting ceases the force cannot be augmented, and unless it is augmented the weekly rest cannot be given. It has been estimated that a very large addition&#x2014;I have not got the figures&#x2014;is necessary in order to give effect to this weekly holiday, and unless we can go on recruiting that cannot be given. I must correct the statement which was made that the weekly half-holiday had already been given. That is not so. A start has been made; we have been able to give half of it, but if it is to be carried out in its complete form we shall have to recruit another 800 men. I have it on the authority of the Secretary of State that if this Bill does not pass to-night he will not be able to go on with that recruiting
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0571"/>
<col>1133</col>
and the weekly half-holiday will have to remain where it is, in a very partial condition.<lb/>
I am rather surprised that the noble Viscount makes such a point of this. He knows, and we all know, that the contributions of the Exchequer to the local services must be revised. That is common ground. A Departmental Committee is considering the Report of the Royal Commission, and it is absolutely certain that before a year or two the whole subject will be reconsidered; and the contributions from Imperial resources to this kind of charge must be very materially increased. Very likely we shall come back to that half-and-half arrangement which the noble Viscount says existed not many years ago. As I said, this is really only a provisional measure to get us over the difficulty. Why deny to the Secretary of State a little measure winch you admit he wants in order to carry on? He comes and asks for an extra penny in case of emergency such as cannot be foreseen&#x2014;surely it is a mere act of confidence in the Secretary of State to give him that slight margin on which he can draw in case of emergency. Add to that the promise he gives that he will not increase it this year, and that it will not be increased at all without a full discussion in Parliament. I do not quite understand the noble Viscount when he asks for a pledge of a substantive Motion. How is it open to my hon. friend to pledge the Government to give a day in the session to discuss this matter? There is a day allotted for the discussion of his own salary He has promised that, if required, this matter shall he raised on his salary and there must be a substantive Motion;</membercontribution></p>

I can understand it in a way, because I see that the noble Viscount is afraid that he is going to part with his bargaining power, and that if he lets this penny go, he will not have anything to bargain with next year. In view of the fact that the whole thing must come up for settlement before many years are over and that it is common ground between both Parties that the Imperial contributions must be increased to these rating expenditures, surely it is not necessary for the noble Viscount to press his opposition on this occasion; and I sincerely trust that he will not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04350"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I should have been only too glad to yield to the appeal of the noble Lord, but it is quite impossible. The whole of what is wanted is a halfpenny rate. We offer a penny rate, and that represents a quarter of a million of money. The noble Lord asks us to give away this gigantic power of taxing us to the extent of another quarter of a million without anything in our own hands which may enable the ratepayers of London to do more than state their case before the Home Secretary. If the Bill is not passed not a single policeman will go short of a farthing, not a single administrative act will be changed for a moment. I hope the House will refuse to give a Second Reading to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

the Naval Discipline (Dominion Naval Forces) Bill. This Bill gives effect to an agreement that was come to at the Imperial Conference that the ships and fleets of the Royal Navy and the ships of the Dominions when co-operating together shall be treated as belonging to the same service so far as discipline is concerned. The effect of the Bill will be to place the Naval Forces of the Dominions in the same position in relation to British Naval Forces and to each other as if both were an integral part of the Imperial Naval Forces. This Bill was read without any comment and with very general satisfaction in another place, and therefore it is with great confidence that I ask your Lordships to be good enough to give this Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

I should like, however, to ask whether the actual Bill has been laid before the Dominion Governments.

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04369"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I think, perhaps, it may be expected that I should say a single word upon the fact that it is not a Money Bill. By the j Parliament Act which we passed this year it is provided in the third subsection of the first clause&#x2014;the language is very familiar to us all&#x2014;that "there shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is sent up to the House of Lords a certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons, signed by him, that it is a Money Bill." The Finance Bill in the present instance is not so endorsed by the Speaker, and therefore it does not come within the class of Money Bills. It comes before your Lordships like any other Bill. It is not for me&#x2014;and it would be highly improper if I were to attempt it&#x2014;to conjecture what parts of the Bill have moved the Speaker to withhold his certificate that it is a Money Bill. There, are about five clauses in the Bill&#x2014;Clauses 4, 6, 7, and, I think, Clauses 13 and 18&#x2014;which deal with matters that possibly might be construed, and possibly the Speaker has so construed them, as going beyond a mere money provision. Of course, we cannot go behind the fact that the Bill has not got this needed endorsement. I do not think I need go further in moving the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04460"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member><membercontribution>: I have an Amendment on the Paper the object of which is to make the metropolitan borough councils the authority for certain purposes under this Act, and although I do not wish to inconvenience your Lordships by a Division, yet I should be grateful to the noble Lord if he could see his way to allow my Amendment to form part of the Bill. Under the previous Shop Acts the metropolitan borough councils had certain powers of closing, and the noble Duke on the Front Bench below me (the Duke of Devonshire) last night explained the reasons why it was desirable that the metropolitan borough councils should retain these powers. I think that for the purposes of closing the borough councils are very much better authorities to be entrusted with this than the London County Council; they understand the local conditions better. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill last night described the difficulty of boundaries, and said that on one side of the street you might have one set of regulations and on the cither side another set if you gave the administration of the Act to the borough councils. But I do not think the conditions would be likely to be so dissimilar that different regulations would prevail. Supposing two borough councils have jurisdiction in the same street and the conditions of the whole area are much the same, these two borough councils would have the same set of conditions prevailing, and on that point I think there is very little to be said. I hope the noble Lord will see his way to accept my Amendment when we reach it. It would still leave the county council's power of inspection untouched.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04461"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I should very much deprecate it if the noble Earl who has just sat down were to insist upon his Amendment. This is an agreed Bill, and this clause is an agreed clause. There has been a rather unfortunate incident, to which the noble Duke referred last night, in the fact that the proviso which gives effect to this intention did not appear upon the White Paper when it was before the House of Commons on the Report stage, but I am grateful to the noble Duke for admitting last night that that was nothing but an inadvertence, and really nobody who was at all interested in the Bill could have been misled thereby. This question was discussed by a Committee of the House of Commons upstairs, and the decision to make the London County Council the authority for London was, after discussion, curried without a division. It was an agreement reached in Committee. I think nearly two months of Parliamentary time elapsed between the Committee stage and the Report stage, and no Amendment appeared on the Paper and no attempt was made in the House of Commons to reverse that decision, and when the question was put in another place from the Chair no division was challenged. Therefore, my Lords, I do submit that this is an agreed clause, and one representing on the whole the considered opinion of both Parties, and I think it would be extremely unfortunate if your Lordships at this late stage of the session were to attempt to reverse that decision. You will, of course, be aware that under the Amendment which I have moved, and which is now before the House, the county council may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, make arrangements with councils of urban districts, and so on, including the metropolitan boroughs, to delegate its powers. Consequently it cannot be said that this is an inelastic provision. If it is found, as the noble Earl contends, that there are places where the borough council can administer the Act as efficiently as the county council, then it is open to the county council to enter into an arrangement forthwith to that effect. I do not myself think that the noble Earl was very convincing when he said that as far as closing orders were concerned the borough council would generally, if not always, be the better authority. As he has taken an interest in the question of early closing he will know, and I am sure he will deplore, the slow advance which
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0578"/>
<col>1147</col>
has been made in London in the direction of early closing. It is a most unfortunate thing that, although in many districts there is a general consensus of opinion amongst shopkeepers as to the desirability of applying for an order, very often owing to small hitches and local jealousies the parties cannot come together, and the closing order is not brought into existence. It is with a view of facilitating the early closing movement, a movement which commands the support of your Lordships' House generally, that this policy of making the county council the authority has been introduced, and I hope that, in view of that fact, the noble Earl will not press the Amendment which stands in his name.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0010P0-04587"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before we advance further with this Bill I desire, at the risk of reiteration, to protest once more against the manner in which this House is called upon to deal with important legislation in the expiring hours of the session. This morning we have been asked to deal with Amendments covering seven pages of paper, Amendments which I believe were only placed in our hands to-day; and not only have we been asked to deal with those Amendments, but with other Amendments not on the Paper which the noble Lord in charge of the Bill produced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04588"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I think it was only one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04589"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Then one certainly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04590"><member>THE LORD CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: There was one new clause put, but as a matter of fact it was down on the Paper, but in a later place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04591"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I accept the explanation, but it is quite impossible for us to deal intelligently with the matters brought before us under such circumstances. The noble Lord himself, if he will forgive me saying so, in spite of the great presence of mind that he showed in handling his Bill, on two or three points evidently was not thoroughly master of the subject. Now what was the noble Lord's justification? It was that at the most his Amendments, he told us, were drafting or consequential Amendments. I do not for one moment question his <i>bona fides,</i> but still there is a limit to the amount of absolute discretion that we can afford to allow to noble Lords in charge of Government Bills. Another defence given by the noble Lord was that some of these things were matter of agreement, and that promises had been made in the House of Commons. I have no doubt that may be so. But that does not in the least, or it ought not in the least, to deprive us of our opportunity of considering the manner in which effect has been given to such agreements. Besides that, most of us have received suggestions from different quarters as to the Bill, and from influential quarters, which we should have been glad to have had time to consider. The noble Lord suggested that a great
<col>1160</col>
deal of our trouble was due to what he called the compression of the Bill. May I suggest to him that the trouble is due not to the compression of the Bill, but to the compression of the opportunities given to this House, which is quite another matter. I know that this Bill is desired by both sides, and I should be sorry to oppose its further progress; but I think noble Lords opposite must really realise that this kind of thing, particularly under the new dispensation to which we are to be subject for the future, ought not to be allowed to continue, and F hope that in another session we shall address ourselves seriously to the task of making some arrangements under which this House will be relieved from the necessity of hurrying, with the kind of indecent haste which has been exhibited this morning, through the provisions of important measures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04592"><member>VISOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I do not at all complain of the noble Marquess for making the observations to which we have just listened, and I do not doubt that if this time next year I have the honour of sitting where the noble Marquess sits, and he sits on this Bench, I shall make a speech probably very similar to the one that he has now made. I thoroughly agree with the noble Marquess that it is deplorable that this House, which still by law has the power of revising Bills, should suffer from what the noble Marquess called compression of opportunities for debate. But the Shops Bill does not, I think, afford a very good opportunity for taking up that position and using that line of argument. It is an agreed Bill. The Bill was cut down in order that it might have the undivided support of both Parties in the House of Commons, and that support was given to it. I quite agree, of course, that your Lordships have really nothing to, do with the fact that the House of Commons came to this or that conclusion on the strength of this or that set of arguments. Your Lordships are responsible, and if we were in normal times that responsibility would be naturally exercised upon a Bill of this kind, which goes very deep into the social habits of an important class of the people. I agree that the House of Commons ought not to be allowed to overrule the proceedings of this House. But, circumstances being what they are, the changes that have been made this morning by the House on the motion of my noble friend behind me are not really of any signal importance. I do not think that they can be
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0585"/>
<col>1161</col>
called important at all. They are changes that were worth making in the opinion of the Government and the Department concerned, and I do not believe if we had had the whole day to argue these Amendments it would have made any difference whatever in the ultimate conclusion. It is no use my saying more. I am as sorry as the noble Marquess that we are placed in this position. It has nothing to do, I must remind him, with the Parliament Act. It is not the Parliament Act or anything in the Parliament Act that causes this congestion of opportunity. It arises from quite different causes, from congestion of business, the causes of which lie far deeper.<lb/>

There will be a further opportunity of interrogation, I think, fit the sitting tomorrow if the noble mid learned Lord finds my answers insufficient, and on that occasion no doubt the noble Viscount will be glad to give fuller and more detailed answers than I am able to do without notice. I may say, with regard to the first inquiry, that it is the hope of the Government that all the doctors in the country will be ready and willing to work under the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04608"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Has the noble I Earl seen the account of the proceedings at the doctors' meeting at Manchester yesterday?</membercontribution></p>
<col>1164</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04609"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I have seen the report referred to and the statement that a certain number of doctors would be unwilling to act under the Bill. Very often resolutions of this kind are passed at gatherings of such a nature, but I am glad that they are not always acted upon afterwards. I hope, that this may be so in the present case, and that the doctors generally throughout the country, when they see the provisions which are made and the regulations that will be issued by the Insurance Commissioners, will be ready to net under the Bill. But, as I lie noble and learned Lord probably knows, the system will be that the doctors' names will be placed upon a panel, and then that each, individual may choose whatever doctor he likes from that panel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04610"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: But must not the doctors having their names on the panel be parties to it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04611"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I think I said that they will lie on the panel. Their names will be on the panel, and the various people will choose whichever doctor they like. We both hope and believe that there will be an amply sufficient supply of doctors on that panel for the patients to be able to secure proper medical attendance. With regard to patronage, I think that an undertaking has been given in another place with regard to the general question, of appointments under this Bill, and I can assure the noble and learned Lord in any case that what lie is afraid of is not really likely to occur. I believe, though I should not be ready to say it offhand and cannot give chapter and verse for it, that a pledge has been given that these appointments will be made under the Civil Service regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04612"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Does that apply to Scotland and Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04613"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HIS MAJESTY'S SPEECH.</title>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04635">And afterwards His Majesty's most gracious Speech was delivered to both Houses of Parliament by the Lord Chancellor (in pursuance of His Majesty's Command) as followeth:</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04636"><i>"My Lords, and Gentlemen,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04637">"My relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04638">"I am happy to say that the negotiations which have taken place between the Governments of France and Germany in regard to Morocco&#x2014;a matter in which My Government was concerned by its treaty engagements&#x2014;have been brought to a conclusion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04639">"In the state of war which unhappily exists between Italy and Turkey I have issued a proclamation declaring the strict neutrality of this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04640">"The deliberations of the Imperial Conference in May and June bore witness to the harmony of the relations subsisting between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the self governing Dominions beyond the Seas and to the growing consciousness of their common interests, as well as to the spirit of loyalty and kinship which pervades these Dominions and adds lustre to My Crown.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04641">"I trust that the labours of the Royal Commission which will shortly be appointed to enquire into the natural resources and the improvement of the trade of the Empire may be fruitful in showing means of ensuring the greater prosperity and promoting the mutual intercourse of My Dominions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04642"><i>"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04643">"I thank you for the liberality with which you have made provision for the services of the year.</p>
<image src="S5LV0010P0I0589"/>
<col>1169</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04644">"My Lords, and Gentlemen,</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04645">"The relations between the two Houses of Parliament have been adjusted by the passing of the Parliament Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04646">"I have given My assent to a Bill which will supplement the policy already sanctioned by Parliament by extending the benefit of Old Age Pensions to persons previously disqualified by reason of the receipt of poor-law relief.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04647">"It is with great satisfaction that I have assented to a Bill to provide for the insurance of the industrial population against loss of health and for the prevention and cure of sickness among them and for the insurance against unemployment of those engaged in trades specially liable to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04648">"I anticipate with confidence that the operation of this measure, while fortifying existing inducements to thrift and self-reliance, will do much to alleviate misery and to check disease among those whose social conditions it is designed to ameliorate; and to mitigate the hardships caused to workmen and their families by those depressions in the labour market which are especially felt in certain precarious trades.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04649">"An Act has been passed consolidating and amending the law relating to Copyright. This measure will enable Me to accede to the International Convention recently signed at Berlin; and when supplemented by corresponding legislation in My self-governing Dominions will, I trust, provide a comprehensive and equitable code of law regulating this important subject throughout My Empire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04650">"The Act effecting modifications in the land system, and in the agricultural administration of Scotland will, I sincerely hope, confer benefit alike upon the agricultural and crofting population and upon the general community.</p>
<col>1170</col>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04651">"The measure for the consolidation and amendment of the Coal Mines Regulation Acts, which marks a great advance on previous legislation for the health and safety of persons employed in the mining industry, met with general acceptance on all sides, and its passage was made the easier by the mutual good-will with which it was received by the representatives of the owners and workmen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04652">"The health and well-being of a large class in the community will be beneficially affected by the Act for Securing a universal half-holiday to Shopkeepers and Shop Assistants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04653">"I thank you for the assiduity with which you have discharged your arduous duties, and I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may attend your work."</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04654">Then a Commission for proroguing the Parliament was read,</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04655">After which the LORD CHANCELLOR said:</p>
<p id="S5LV0010P0-04656">MY LORDS and GENTLEMEN, By virtue of His Majesty's Commission, under the Great Seal, to us and other Lords directed, and now read, we do, in His Majesty's Name and in obedience to His Commands, prorogue this Parliament to Wednesday the Fourteenth day of February One thousand nine hundred and twelve, to be then here holden; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to Wednesday the Fourteenth day of February One thousand nine hundred and twelve.</p>
