<p id="S5LV0007P0-00171">THE KING, being seated on the Throne, and the Commons being at the Bar with their SPEAKER, His Majesty made and subscribed the declaration pursuant to the Accession Declaration Act, 1910, and afterwards made a most gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament, and then retired.</p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00173">"<i>My Lords, and Gentlemen</i>,</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00174">"In opening the first Parliament elected in My reign, the grievous loss which the Empire has sustained by the death of My beloved Father is upper most in My thoughts. When, a year ago, He addressed you from the Throne no one could have foreseen that His life of unceasing and devoted activity in the service of His subjects was so soon to be cut short. Bowing to the inscrutable decree of Providence, I take courage from His example, and I am sustained in My abiding sorrow by the sympathy extended to me by My people in every part of My Dominions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00175">"I have welcomed back My Uncle, the Duke of Connaught, on the completion of the Mission in South Africa, which I entrusted to him, and it has deeply gratified Me to learn that he was received with demonstrations of the utmost enthusiasm and loyalty in every part of My South African Dominions, and by every class of the community.</p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00177">"The Japanese Government, having given notice of their intention to terminate the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1894, negotiations, which it is hoped will result in a satisfactory arrangement, have been entered upon for the conclusion of a new Treaty.</p>

tions to the Persian Government, who have since given attention to the subject. Some improvement has lately been shown in the condition of the routes, and My Ministers propose to await further developments before pressing for the adoption of their own proposals, which, in any case, would have no other object than to see the authority of the Persian Government restored and trade protected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00179">"I look forward with much interest to the assembling in May next of the Imperial Conference, at which the Chief Ministers of My Self-Governing Dominions and of the Mother Country will unite in counsel regarding matters of importance submitted by My respective Governments.</p>

<title>ADDRESS IN REPLY TO HIS<lb/> MAJESTY'S MOST GRACIOUS<lb/> SPEECH.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00195"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ILKESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to move that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty thanking him for his gracious Speech from the Throne. I do so with a deep sense of the special responsibility and difficulty of the task on this occasion, which marks the opening of the first session of the first Parliament elected in a new reign&#x2014;a session, moreover, which is likely, from all one can tell, to be a historical session inasmuch as it will be called upon to deal with grave Constitutional problems. In these circumstances I venture to ask for an extra measure of that generous indulgence which your Lordships are accustomed to grant to one who addresses this House for the first time.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0029"/>
<col>7</col>
My Lords, I am sure that every one here and every subject outside this Chamber will desire to associate himself with the touching words with which the gracious Speech opens, and which refer to the profound sorrow that fell upon this country, and, indeed, on the whole civilised world, last year through the ever-to-be-lamented death of our beloved Sovereign Edward VII. He was a Monarch who in a most unique way grew year by year&#x2014;nay, I may almost say day by day&#x2014;during his too short reign, in the love and respect of his people, while he developed at the same time those high qualities as a Ruler which made him a great influence throughout the civilised world. It was in keeping with his remarkable personality that he always used his influence to promote the happiness and prosperity of his people at home, while abroad he used it to ensure goodwill among the nations of the earth. In this way he won the highest title among the many given to Monarchs in all ages, in the noble name of Peacemaker. Long may his influence be felt; long and widely may his example be followed&#x0021;<lb/>
The accession of His Majesty King George V took place amid deep and universal sympathy, and was hailed with that affectionate regard and confidence which his well-known and frequently expressed interest in the wide Dominions of this Empire has won for him. These qualities have throned the King secure and high in the hearts of his people; and the wise project of His Majesty, announced in the gracious Speech, of giving to the hundreds of millions of his subjects in India a personal and proper share in the celebration of his Coronation as Emperor of India is an indication of the continuance of that regard for his Dominions beyond the seas which will increase the popularity of the Monarchy throughout the Realm. The same sagacious policy dictated the Mission of His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught to South Africa recently, and I am sure this House rejoices that that visit has resulted in such unequivocal success.<lb/>
My Lords, the paragraph in the gracious Speech referring to foreign affairs calls for little comment, but contains matter for much congratulation, for it refers to our friendly relations with Foreign Powers. The other matters mentioned are such that we are justified in expecting satisfactory settlements, and in anticipating
<col>8</col>
with confidence that the Coronation year will be blessed with that "Beauteous Peace" which "gives safety, strength, and glory to a people." My noble friend who will follow me will speak of the approaching Imperial Conference which is to assemble in May. Therefore, with your Lordships' permission, I will now turn to the paragraphs which promise legislation.<lb/>
To quote the words of the gracious Speech&#x2014;
<quote>"Proposals will be submitted to you without delay for settling the relations between the two Houses of Parliament, with the object of securing the more effective working of the Constitution."</quote>
Those words raise in a direct form the question of the powers of this House. That question has haunted the whole of my political life, for in 1884, when I first began active political work, I had the honour to be associated through Birmingham politics with that far-seeing Statesman, Mr. John Bright. There was at that time very acute feeling in the country in connection with the Franchise Bill and the action of this House in connection with that measure, and men's minds were greatly exercised on the very subject which is likely to receive our attention during this Session. Mr. Bright, speaking as a moderate man, and after discussing suggested schemes for the reform of this House, then said&#x2014;
<quote>"Now, the proposition that I should make would be this: that they [the House of Lords] should have unimpaired all the power they have now with regard to any Bill that has passed the House of Commons for the first time during the session in which the Lords are called upon to deal with it. That is, in the case of this Bill they would be at liberty to amend it, and send it back to the Commons. If the Commons did not like the Amendments and would not accept them, the Bill would go back to the fords, and if the Lords chose they might reject it. But in a second session, if practically the same Bill was sent up to the Lords, they would then also have a right to debate and to amend; but when the Bill came down to the House of Commons in this second session and the Commons would not agree to the Amendments of the Lords, then the Lords should be bound to accept the Bill."</quote>
At that time&#x2014;nearly twenty-seven years ago&#x2014;this was not regarded as a wild and extravagant proposal. On the contrary, as I know from a close acquaintance with the constituencies, it was regarded as extremely moderate.<lb/>
Since then the country has grown more and more democratic, and the institution of county councils and the general develop
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0030"/>
<col>9</col>
ment of local government throughout I he country have trained all classes to regard popularly-elected bodies everywhere as the only constituted authorities in legislation and administration. That consideration is one to which, I think, during the coming Session your Lordships will have to give due weight. Mr. Bright called his suggestion "a complete remedy with the least disturbance." The least disturbance&#x2014;that, above all things, is what is to be desired at the present time in the best interests of the country. Last year there was before your Lordships' House the plan of the Government, embodied in the Parliament Bill. It was more moderate than the proposal of 1884. It required a Bill to be rejected, not twice, but three times by this House over a period of not less than two years and three successive Sessions. In other words, a Bill to be passed without your Lordships' consent. would have to be read nine times and go through at least three Committee stages in the House of Commons and be before the country for discussion for over two years&#x2014;an ample safeguard, I venture to think, against hasty and ill-considered legislation.<lb/>
The Parliament Bill was, I believe, honestly drawn to cause the least disturbance and to leave to this House the great and wholesome powers of initiation, revision, and delay. Its main object was to open a way through, a reasonable, deliberate, and even tardy way through, for Bills sent up to your Lordships irrespective of the political colour of the House of Commons. That demand for a way through on conditions reasonable and impartial is what will have to be considered in the coming Session. The noble Marquess opposite, who leads the Opposition in this House with, if he will allow me to say so, such conspicuous ability, has described this as the sterilisation of the House of Lords. Sterilisation is an ugly word. But my profession has taught me to regard it as connoting a beneficent process which destroys hurtful influences and still retains the wholesome and useful constituents of the article sterilised. In this sense I respectfully submit that the Government plan might preserve all wholesome nutriment for the body politic and get rid of the disturbing and dangerous elements. I say this as one who prays earnestly that this House may for many generations continue to perform functions of great
<col>10</col>
authority and usefulness. The gracious Speech refers to other measures of great and far-reaching social reform, with which my noble friend who will second the Address will deal. It only remains for me to thank your Lordships for the kindly and patient hearing which you have given to my remarks, and to move the Address.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00196"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords my noble friend in his opening remarks made an earnest appeal to your Lordships to extend to him your generous indulgence and consideration in making his first speech in your Lordships' House. If it be necessary for him to make that appeal, how much more necessary must it be for me. Who have not a tithe of my noble friend's political experience and Parliamentary knowledge? I therefore most earnestly ask you to accord me a, special measure of your indulgence and consideration; and I will promise on my own account that while I shall be very brief in my remarks, I will endeavour to uphold what. I believe is the tradition on these occasions and say nothing of a controversial nature.<lb/>
May I at the outset add a few words to the graceful references which my noble friend has made to the first paragraph in the gracious Speech? There can be no doubt that by the death of His Majesty King Edward VII this country sustained a great anti grievous loss, the loss of a Sovereign who by his tact, his magnetism, and his personal influence not only endeared himself to all his people, but held high the dignity and prestige of his Throne. King Edward has been taken from us, but I feel sure that the recollection of his great services will always remain with us&#x2014;the recollection by a grateful people of one who during his life and almost up to the day of his death worked, and worked strenuously, for the good of his country. But, my Lords, while we mourn the loss of our late King, we surely have good reason to rejoice in the sure and certain knowledge that His present Majesty King George is determined to uphold the high traditions of our Royal House. And here may I add that I am sure it is a matter of rejoicing to us to know that His Majesty will be so ably assisted in his high responsibilities by Her most, gracious Majesty the Queen. Loyalty to the Throne is an instinct of the British race, and it is satisfactory, at the beginning of this Parliament, to be able to assure His Majesty of the loyalty of every subject in his Dominions
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0031"/>
<col>11</col>
and, further, to assure him that we are determined to assist him in every way to maintain the greatness and honour of his Throne and Empire.<lb/>
In this year, which I hope may be one of the most auspicious years in the annals of our history, it is satisfactory to your Lordships, I am sure, to know that our relations with foreign Powers are thoroughly friendly. I trust that that condition of things may long continue, and that, if there has been any feeling of suspicion, of distrust, between us and any foreign Power at any time, during this year that feeling may be entirely swept away, and that we may in future live in friendliness and amity with all the great countries of the world. You will have noticed that there are two matters which are the subject of negotiation between ourselves and other great countries. I have always felt that it is unwise for any layman with insufficient knowledge to attempt to discuss in detail any subject of negotiation between Governments, particularly if they refer to foreign affairs. Therefore I pass by that by merely saying that I sincerely trust that the negotiations may come to a sound and satisfactory issue to all concerned.<lb/>
The forthcoming visit of our great Colonial Prime Ministers marks, I think, the first of those quadrennial Conferences which will in future become part of the established system of our Imperial life. I am sure we all hope that these Conferences may be productive of the best results, and may tend to the binding closer together of the Mother Country and the Colonies. I think we may be sure, if we may judge from the published resolutions that have already been sent from the Colonies of Australia and New Zealand, that there is no lack of interest in Imperial affairs in our Colonies, nor will there be any lack of material for debate when the forthcoming Conference meets. It must be a matter of great satisfaction to your Lordships to observe the continual influence, importance, and prosperity of our Colonies, and with that continual influence, importance, and prosperity their determination and their resolve to assist us more and more in taking their share in upholding the responsibilities of the maintenance of this great Empire.<lb/>
May I be allowed to express the view which I have long felt, that this satisfactory condition of things is in the main due to the policy of self-government, which I
<col>12</col>
believe has been the mainspring of the enormous success of our Colonial administration; for while it has given free liberty to our Colonies, it has tended to a feeling of mutual trust, mutual confidence, and mutual loyalty between all parts of the Empire. If we look at Canada and New Zealand we find there great Colonies prospering exceedingly, containing a race of vigorous and independent men, who are working for the good of the Empire, and who have shown in the past, and, if need be, will show in the future, their devotion and loyalty to the Motherland. Perhaps I may he allowed one word of personal reminiscence in saying a few words in reference to Australia, for I well remember, when I had the honour of acting on the staff there of my noble friend and relative Lord Brassey some fifteen years ago, attending Conferences in the City of Melbourne which led to the grouping of those Colonies into the great Commonwealth of Australia. From some practical knowledge of that country and of its inhabitants I think I can safely say that, given more population and further prospects of development, it will become one of the greatest Imperial assets under the Crown.<lb/>
And last, but not least&#x2014;for I sincerely think that this has proved the most successful instance of our policy of self government&#x2014;I wish to say one or two words with regard to South Africa. I am well aware that there are some who still think that our policy there has been premature, and who have gloomy forebodings with regard to the future; but I own that for my own part I am a confirmed optimist in this matter, and I believe that as years go by we shall find in South Africa a race of people as loyal and as devoted to the Throne as in any other Colony in the Empire. And is not this view to some extent borne out by the extraordinary enthusiasm on the part of every race and every class of people which attended the visit of the Duke of Connaught when he went on his great Imperial Mission as representing His Majesty the King to set the final seal on the Act of Union by opening the Union Parliament in South Africa? I think we may safely say that the recollection of that visit will long remain in that Colony, and I am sure you would wish that I should express our grateful and respectful thanks to His Royal Highness for this great Imperial service. I cannot conclude this reference to our Colonies without adding this one remark,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0032"/>
<col>13</col>
that I think we may rejoice with the great Dominion of Canada in the knowledge that His Royal Highness has lately consented to take up the high and responsible duties of Governor-General of that Colony, and we feel confident that his presence there will tend much to the consolidation of the Empire.<lb/>
My noble friend has dealt with such intimate knowledge and so thoroughly with the question of Constitutional reform that it will require very few words from me, but I am glad to have this opportunity of stating, for what it is worth, my individual opinion on this somewhat controversial question. I am strongly in favour of dual-Chamber government in this country, and I believe it would be a misfortune if the dual-Chamber system were done away with. But having been a Member of Parliament in another place for a good many years, I am bound to say that I have long held the view that your Lordships' House required considerable reform and I hope and trust that the reform of this House may be the ultimate outcome of this Constitutional controversy. But, my Lords, I must honestly say this, that believe that the passing of the Parliament Bill is a preliminary and necessary step to a sound and satisfactory solution of the question of the reform of yourLordships' House, and to the securing of principal Government measures passing into law. We have had much discussion and much controversy on this question. We have lately had a General Election, the verdict of which is probably quite fresh in your Lordships' minds; and although I know that it would be an impertinence in me to surmise what will be, or even to suggest what to my mind should be, the action of His Majesty's Ministers, still less of noble Lords opposite when this measure comes before your Lordships' House, might I be allowed to make this one observation, that at the beginning of this Parliament, synchronising so closely as it does with the beginning of what we all trust will be a most peaceful and prosperous reign, I most profoundly hope we shall approach this question in a spirit of reason, and with a desire for fair play and justice all round, and thus I trust we may come to a satisfactory conclusion of what is, no doubt, a very difficult problem.<lb/>
My noble friend has told your Lordships that I intended saying a few words with regard to the other Bills mentioned in the gracious Speech from the Throne, but I
<col>14</col>
feel that I need not detain you for more than one or two minutes, for the main principles of those two Bills are well known to all your Lordships' minds. The first extends the benefit of old age pensions to those people who hitherto have not been able to enjoy that boon owing to the fact that they have received Poor-law relief; the other provides, by a system of mutual insurance, the principles of relief in sickness and invalidity to people in our great industrial centers. These Bills, I feel quite sure, will, when they come up to your Lordships' House, receive your generous and sympathetic consideration. I have endeavoured, very inadequately, to express my views with regard to the position of our Imperial interests and to the measures that are coming before us during the forthcoming Session. May I, in conclusion, while thanking your Lordships sincerely for the courteous way in which you have listened to my remarks, express the profound hope that the legislative and administrative work of this Session may conduce to the permanent prosperity of the people, and to the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and his Dominions.<lb/>
Moved, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty in reply to the gracious Speech from the Throne.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ilkeston.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00197"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust that I may be permitted at the outset to offer our congratulations to the two noble Lords who have just addressed us. We have listened to them with pleasure. Both of them bring to the House Parliamentary experience; both of them have been thought worthy of promotion to office by their own Party; both of them will, I have no doubt, contribute usefully to our discussions in future. The noble Lord who moved the Address brings to this House not only political experience but knowledge of another kind, which we feel can be applied to advantage in the discussion of many of the subjects which come before us; and I may, perhaps, be permitted to say that one effect of his presence on the Benches opposite will be that we shall all of us be extremely careful how we use scientific metaphors.<lb/>
We desire to associate ourselves with all that was said by the two noble Lords in regard to the subject dealt with in the opening paragraph of His Majesty's Speech. From this House, at any rate, he will receive in the fullest measure
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0033"/>
<col>15</col>
that sympathy for which he looks in the abiding sorrow to which he refers. And the same feelings will go out to him when, before long, he assumes the Crown of these realms. He will approach that memorable occasion in his life with the good will and affection of a loyal Empire and with every omen propitious for the new reign which is now opening.<lb/>
His Majesty, in speaking of the reign of his Royal father, dwells upon the unceasing and devoted activity shown by King Edward VII in the service of his subjects. That devoted activity is characteristic of the Royal House, and I think we may say that the Speech from the Throne contains two illustrations of the manner in which that activity is exercised. We have, in the first place, the King's reference to the visit of His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught to South Africa&#x2014;a visit upon which we heartily congratulate His Royal Highness; and we have the further reference to His Majesty's own contemplated visit to his Indian Dominions. I feel sure that we may confidently anticipate that this exhibition of His Majesty's interest in his Indian subjects will be acclaimed by them. It is rather a common-place of those who speak and write of India to say that there is no such thing as an Indian people, and that those who dwell in that country are divided by race, religion, geographical features, and other distinctions. All that is, no doubt, perfectly true, but I do believe that if there is any one feeling which would tend to unite all classes of the community in India it is a feeling of allegiance to the ruler who at the very outset of his reign gives this striking proof of his interest in his Indian Dominions.<lb/>
Both the noble Lords dwelt with satisfaction upon the sentence in the gracious Speech which deals with the foreign relations of this country. We are always glad to be reassured in this matter. We are a peace-loving nation. We are not at this moment conscious of having any quarrel, or any cause for quarrel, with any foreign Power. But we cannot conceal from ourselves that there is a certain spirit of restlessness in the world, that the great nations are showing, with every year that passes, an increased need of expansion, that their competition for commercial advantages becomes keener and keener, that competition in armaments becomes ever more acute; and he would indeed be
<col>16</col>
sanguine who ventured to say that the condition of the civilised world was one of perfectly stable equilibrium at the present time. We therefore hear with satisfaction the words which, on the advice of his Ministers, His Majesty uses when he tells us that his relations with foreign Powers are of a friendly description.<lb/>
My Lords, the next paragraph in the Speech deals with the negotiations which have been in progress with the Japanese Government for a Treaty of Commerce to replace the Treaty of 1894. I notice with some relief that we arc told that these negotiations are likely to result in a satisfactory arrangement. I say this because there have certainly been circumstances which led us to believe that the adjustment of such an arrangement might not prove to be a very easy matter. I dare say your Lordships may recollect that about a year ago Count Komura delivered a speech in which lie explained that the new statutory tariff of Japan was to be of universal application, and he added that, although there would be conventional tariffs with certain Powers, those conventional tariffs would only be admitted where the Power in question was able to give reciprocal advantages. He was reported to have added that, as Great Britain was pursuing what is called the Free Trade policy, there would be no room for a convention with that country. It is possible that that passage in Count Komura's speech may have been imperfectly reported; but it certainly created very considerable alarm in this country because the immediate result was that a deputation of gentlemen interested in the trade of Japan called upon the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and begged him to do what he could to prevent their interests from suffering. They were apparently not quite so convinced as some members of His Majesty's Government that duties of this kind are always paid by the consumer. I dare say some of your Lordships may have seen the new Japanese tariff. The increases are enormously high&#x2014;in some cases as much as 500 per cent. In cotton yarns the increases range from 40 per cent. to 250 per cent.; in woollens from 30 to 120 per cent.; and there is a substantial increase in most of the leading branches of British trade. We shall, therefore, be greatly comforted if the noble Earl is able to tell us confidently that the new arrangement is likely to be satisfactory to this country.<lb/>

May I say one word upon another foreign question which is not mentioned in the gracious Speech from the Throne? There have been during the last few days very disquieting reports in regard to Macedonia. An operation described as disarmament is in progress in that most long suffering corner of the world. An army which has lately been employed in Albania under a general who appears to be a soldier of a very strenuous description has now visited Macedonia, and it is repotted that the disarmament is being carried out in circumstances of very great barbarity and in a very partial manner. A Turkish member of Parliament lately assured his audience that in the three districts of Salonika, Monastir, and Uskub no fewer than 4,000 persons had been maltreated, of whom sixty-one had been permanently disabled and eleven beaten to death. I do not know whether His Majesty's Government are aware of these occurrences; but I do trust that we shall hear that they are being watched with a vigilant eye; and we cannot be surprised that the comment on them should be that confidence in the new Constitutional system has been gravely shattered in Turkey.<lb/>
I pass to another matter which is not mentioned in the gracious Speech, although some of us might have expected that it would have been mentioned. I mean the Declaration of London. We all of us welcome the attempts which have been made, not without a considerable amount of success, to settle by peaceful means international difficulties and complications. In 1907 this country became a. party to a Convention entered into at The Hague for the establishment of an international Prize Court, and we have lately had another conference in this city for the purpose of drawing up the rules under which this international Prize Court is to do its work. The noble Earl opposite must be aware that the publication of these rules has created very grave apprehensions in the minds of the commercial public. I wish carefully to guard myself against accepting all the criticisms which have been levelled at these rules. I am quite ready to admit that it is our business to compare the state of things which might arise under these rules, not with an ideal condition of things which we should like to arrive at if we could, but with the actual condition of things which takes place under the national rules by which
<col>18</col>
foreign Powers are at present guided. But making allowance for all this, I am bound to say that as to some points the uneasiness to which expression has been given does not seem to me altogether unreasonable. While I take it that most of us would be glad to see an international Prize Court substituted for the national Prize Courts with which we now have to be content, we should, most of us, be inclined to say that our approval was subject to two conditions.&#x2014;the satisfactory constitution of the Court itself and the satisfactory framing of the rules which the Court will have to administer.<lb/>
The position of this country is different from that of any other; and for that reason we are surely right if we regard these questions with a. more critical eye than other Powers regard them. This country, owing to its insular position. is entirely dependent upon sea-borne supplies. We are constantly told that it is our business to maintain the command of the sea, and we are told with great confidence that we may depend upon maintaining that command. But be that command never so well maintained, does it not yet remain the case that in time of war the great ocean highways cannot be so thoroughly policed as to render it possible for trade to flow along them quite in its normal fashion? Our supplies must run the gauntlet of an enemy's cruisers, and the question which people are asking themselves is whether these new rules will really render it easier or more difficult for those supplies to reach our shores. It is impossible to discuss so intricate a subject upon an occasion like this; but I do wish to express my hope that His Majesty's Government will spare no pains to take into their confidence the representatives of the great commercial interests who, I think I am right in saying, had no part in the discussions which took place in London, and that they will endeavour, before these new regulations are ratified, to satisfy themselves that they are not really open to those objections which have been urged with so much force in many influential quarters.<lb/>
I confess that the paragraph in the gracious Speech dealing with the condition of Southern Persia gives me somewhat cold comfort. Our complaints with regard to the condition of Southern Persia are of very long standing. His Majesty's
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0035"/>
<col>19</col>
Government report that some improvement is noticeable and they intend to await further developments. By all means let us be patient. But I think the people of this country will become impatient if the patience of His Majesty's Government is too much prolonged; for after all there would be no trade routes and no trade in Southern Persia if it were not for the enterprise of British subjects and the activity which has been shown at different times by the British Government and by the Government of India. The condition of these trade routes has been scandalous, and I trust that before long either substantial amelioration will have taken place or else that His Majesty's Government will not hesitate to resort to the measures which they have announced for the purpose of putting things upon a better footing.<lb/>
His Majesty's Speech goes on to refer to the approaching Colonial Conference and to the visit of the delegates by whom the great overseas Dominions will be represented. We shall welcome these distinguished Statesmen and we shall rejoice at their presence on the occasion of His Majesty's Coronation. But they are coming here, as we are told in the Speech, on business of importance, and it is to such matters of business that our thoughts naturally turn. Amongst those matters of business none is more important than the commercial relations of these great Colonies with the Mother Country. We have ventured more than once to point out that while in regard to their relations with the Mother Country no progress was being made, in regard to their relations with foreign countries matters were by no means standing still, and now we are informed that Canada, after knocking in vain at our door, is going to follow up her commercial Agreements with France and Germany by a commercial Agreement with the United States of America. As the noble Lord who spoke second truly said, it is our desire to leave these great Dominions to work out their own development, and I shall not permit myself to say a word of complaint as to the action of the Canadian Government; but there can be no doubt that this is really a most momentous departure, not only in the history of Canada, but in the history of the British Empire.<lb/>
The commercial policy of Canada has hitherto been developed upon national and Imperial lines. The policy introduced by
<col>20</col>
Sir John Macdonald was known in Canada as the national policy. This new policy, so far as we are able to judge, proceeds not upon national and Imperial lines, but upon continental lines&#x2014;a wholly different thing. The endeavour appears to he no longer to draw the trade of the Dominion from west to east and east to west, but to direct it southwards, and in accordance with the geographical features of the country. The primary effects of this policy, if effect is given to it, are not difficult to anticipate. You will have, in the first place, a considerable diminution of the opportunities for Preference within the British Empire. You will have, in the second place, a diminution of the advantages now enjoyed by British trade under the Preference which the Canadian Government has already extended to us. And you will have, in the third place, a deflexion of the vast and almost unlimited food supplies which the great granaries of the North-west of Canada are capable of producing from ourselves towards the great country which lies immediately to the south of the Canadian border. Those effects are important enough; but if we pause to consider the remoter consequences of this new policy, it is surely not an exaggerated view to say that these may be of an infinitely more far-reaching character. The whole history of the Empire may indeed be altered if these great Dominions, which we properly speak of as sister nations rather than as Colonies, are encouraged to develop, not upon national and Imperial lines, but in accordance with considerations of geographica proximity. I do not know whether any Papers will be laid on the Table, but the matter seems to me to he of such vast importance that I could not pass it by without one word of notice.<lb/>
I pass to those passages of His Majesty's Speech which deal with the programme of business during the coming Session; and I trust that I shall not be called to order if I pause for one moment at the paragraph which is not addressed to your Lordships' House but to the other House of Parliament&#x2014;the paragraph dealing with finance. It is a paragraph of unusual brevity. I can remember for many years that the Speech from the Throne always contained an intimation that the Estimates for the year had been prepared with due regard to economy. A different formula came to be adopted, and I think in the Speech of last year it was said that it was desirable
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0036"/>
<col>21</col>
to enforce economy, but that there were very extensive calls on the Exchequer which had to be met. This year economy has disappeared altogether&#x2014;it is not even hinted at&#x2014;and we can scarcely be surprised. I venture to say one word in regard to the manner in which the great subject of finance is at present dealt with in Parliament, and I am speaking not of what may be in store under any new dispensation but of what actually happens to-day in present circumstances. Surely we are justified in urging, if, as we admit, finance is primarily the concern not of this House but of the House of Commons, that that claim on the part of the House of Commons carries with it a corresponding obligation that finance shall be thoroughly, punctually, and carefully discussed and examined in that House. What I think we may fairly charge upon His Majesty's Government is that they so manage the business of the country as to render it absolutely impossible for the other House of Parliament to deal with finance otherwise than in the most spasmodic, uncertain. and unsatisfactory fashion.<lb/>
Will your Lordships consider the record of His Majesty's Government during the last two years? The Budget of 1909 was carried over until 1910. That was not the fault of His Majesty's Government, but they solemnly assured Parliament that when the House met again in the beginning of last year finance was to be the first matter brought before it. We know perfectly well that finance was, on the contrary, put on one side for reasons which were perfectly obvious to any one who watched the course of political events, and that the arrears of 1909 were not cleared up until comparatively late in 1910. Then came the Budget of 1910, when there was no interference on the part of your Lordships' House. The Budget of 1910 was taken up, was dropped, and came up again for discussion late in the month of November of last year; and even then it was only by a rigorous application of the closure that you were able to secure the Tea Duties and the Income-Tax portions of the Budget. The remainder of last year's Budget has been again carried over, and Parliament has been promised that that most important <i>remanet</i> is to be dealt with with the usual measure of latitude before the end of the present financial year.<lb/>
<col>22</col>
I ask your Lordships what in these circumstances is likely to be the fate of the Budget of 1911? These matters, as I said just now, are not supposed to concern us as members of one of the Houses of Parliament, but they concern us very much as taxpayers; and we have surely a right to raise our voices when we find His Majesty's Government continually by their action depriving the taxpayers of the protection which they ought to derive from thorough and adequate discussion of the national expenditure.<lb/>
This homily, for which I really apologise, is perhaps not entirely out of place because the measures which are announced in the Speech are all of them, unless I misunderstand them, measures which spell considerable additions to that expenditure. There is a measure dealing with old-age pensions. I shall be obliged, by the way, if the noble Earl will tell us why a Bill is necessary. We were rather under the impression that financial provision had already been made for dealing with those cases where the removal of the pauper disqualification involved an additional charge. The Bills relating on the one hand to insurance against invalidity and on the other to insurance against unemployment deal with subjects which have attracted a great deal of attention; and I think I may say that the proposals of His Majesty's Government will be examined with a feeling of sympathy and a desire that some means may be found of dealing with both of these most important questions.<lb/>
But, my Lords, there is one measure, also a costly measure, to which I understand His Majesty's Government are committed, which is not mentioned at all in the gracious Speech. What about payment of Members? I believe I am correct in saying that before the end of last Session the Prime Minister gave two pledges to Parliament&#x2014;pledges which were provoked by the Osborne judgment, and the peremptory demand made by the Labour Members for the reversal of that judgment. The Prime Minister gave in the first place a pledge that provision would be made for the payment of Members, and for the payment of their election expenses. He also announced that if he came back to power he would propose legislation empowering trade unions to include in their objects and organisation the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0037"/>
<col>23</col>
provision of a fund for Parliamentary and municipal action and representation and kindred objects. Those two pledges were given; but we find not a word about either of those measures in the Speech from the Throne.<lb/>
At this point I desire to make a brief digression. I referred just now to the Osborne judgment. I think that we on this side of the House may fairly complain of His Majesty's Government and of their supporters for the manner in which, particularly during the recent election campaign, they encouraged the belief that it was this House sitting as a Second Chamber which was responsible for the Osborne judgment, the Taff Vale judgment, and various other judgments of the House of Lords sitting as an Appellate Tribunal which have not been entirely satisfactory to certain classes of the public. Only the other day I noticed that a member of Parliament stated that the trade unions were being compelled to change their constitution "at the dictation of the House of Lords," the suggestion obviously being that it was those 600 Peers&#x2014;who, as we know, stand between the people and all beneficent proposals&#x2014;who were interfering with the constitution of the trade unions. But I am sorry to say that it is not only the more insignificant supporters of the Government who use this language. My attention was called to the election address issued by a right hon. colleague of the noble Earl's, a colleague of whom I wish to speak with a very great respect, a respect which I sincerely feel for him&#x2014;I mean Mr. John Burns. What did he say on the subject? He was taking the House of Lords to task for their interference with useful legislation, and he said that&#x2014;
<quote>"The House of Lords were not content with being the final Court of Appeal in the interpretation of the laws,"</quote>
but that they displayed class partiality in their dealings with the legislation which came before them. We know perfectly well in this House that the decisions of the House of Lords sitting as an Appellate Court are in form the orders of this House, but we also know perfectly well that the House as a House has nothing whatever to do with them; and it is, I must say, intolerable that this kind of fiction should be allowed to prevail and to get bold of the mind of the people of the country, as I verily
<col>24</col>
believe they have got hold of the mind of the people in many parts of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I go back for one moment to the Osborne judgment. I desire to ask the noble Earl with reference to what I said a moment ago, first, whether the two pledges given by the Prime Minister last year hold good, in spite of the failure to mention them in the King's Speech. I should like also to know whether those pledges cover the whole ground, and whether we may understand that if those pledges are fulfilled there is no idea of attempting to do what is commonly described as reversing the Osborne judgment. In the third place, I ask the noble Earl whether in his opinion these measures which the Prime Minister has announced are, in his view, of so trivial and domestic a character as to render them unworthy of a place in the gracious Speech from the Throne. I can only say&#x2014;and I think I can speak not for myself alone&#x2014;that I can conceive no more dangerous innovation, no more serious innovation certainly, than the new departure involved by the decision to pay Members of Parliament out of the public purse. I say nothing of the extravagance of the measure and the addition which it will make to the burden of the country.<lb/>
But do you imagine for a moment that you will be able to stop with the payment of the House of Commons? What about the four new Houses of Parliament which we understand are before long to be created in different parts of the country? Will they not have to be paid? I should like to ask even, What about the new and democratically-constituted House of Lords? Will the democratically-constituted House of Lords be so fastidious as to reject the Sessional allowances which are paid with so much liberality in other parts of the world to the different Second Chambers which are to be found there? And what about our county councils and those great municipal bodies which now render ungrudgingly so much valuable and gratuitous service to the country and which will most certainly ask, if other people dip their fingers into the national purse, why they should not be accorded a similar privilege. I venture to express my doubt whether under this new system the country will be better served, although it will be more expensively served. I venture to doubt
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0038"/>
<col>25</col>
whether working men of the type we should like to see in the House of Commons will really gain very much by the change, and, lastly, I doubt whether the House of Commons itself will be as much respected when it becomes not only omnipotent, but salaried under an arrangement by which I presume every year the Members of that House will vote their own remuneration on the Estimates.<lb/>
I offer one word in passing about the short penultimate sentence of the Speech which mentions that&#x2014;
<quote>"other measures of importance will be introduced and proceeded with as time and opportunity allow."</quote>
It is very usual, if my memory does not play me false, to find in the King's Speech a certain number of measures of the first rank enumerated, with a sort of rearguard of minor measures that are to be taken if time permits. But one is generally given some hint of the complexion of these measures of the second rank. I should like to know whether these other measures are merely measures of minor importance, routine measures, or whether this innocent little clause is the "lucky bag" to which the Welsh supporters of His Majesty's Government are to be told to look for Welsh Disestablishment and the Irish supporters of the Government for Home Rule? I hope that the noble Earl will vouchsafe some explanation at any rate on that point.<lb/>
Before I sit down may I say a word&#x2014;I have, not unnaturally, left it to the last&#x2014;with regard to the great measure hinted at in the last paragraph but three of the Speech? It is a very innocently worded paragraph. We are told that&#x2014;
<quote>"proposals will be submitted without delay for settling the relations between the two Houses of Parliament, with the object of securing the more effective working of the Constitution,"</quote>
as if the Constitution of this country, which has been the envy of other countries, and a Constitution under which this country has prospered and grown great., can be said to have broken down merely because noble Lards opposite have been unable to secure the passage of half-a-dozen measures on which they had set their affections.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, what are these proposals going to be? The noble Lord who spoke first gave us to understand plainly that
<col>26</col>
what was intended was the reintroduction of the Parliament Bill of which your Lordships were allowed to have a brief glimpse last autumn. The noble Lord apparently persuaded himself that that Bill is a measure of the most moderate and ordinary description. I am afraid we cannot quite concur with him on that point. But what we rather desire to know is this&#x2014;Is that Bill going to be reintroduced, and is it going to be hustled through Parliament without the alteration of a word or a line, hustled through one of the Houses of Parliament by the aid of those allies upon whose support. His Majesty's Government depend, and passed through this House by a strain of that Constitution for the effective working of which His Majesty's Govern meat are so solicitous? That is what we are given to understand by that portion of the Press which is supposed to be inspired with regard to these questions. And yet I cannot help hoping that when the noble Earl follows me he will be able to tell us that that is really not what he and his colleagues have in their minds. Can it be, after all that has happened, that the Parliament. Bill is to be thrust on the country without even a respectful consideration of the criticisms which it will encounter?<lb/>
For what has happened since these proposals first saw the light? In the first place, we have had the Conference. The Conference sat for five months. Now people do not prolong their sittings for five months merely for the purpose of deciding whether they are going to say "Aye" or "No" to a particular measure. The secrets of the Conference have been well respected, but some light has been thrown upon what took place around the Conference table. The Prime Minister&#x2014;and I do not complain of his statement as being in any way an indiscreet one&#x2014;speaking in East Fife in December said this of the Conference&#x2014;
<quote>"it held many sittings; its deliberations extended over many months, and there were moments, many moments indeed, very nearly up to the close of its deliberations, when I myself entertained, when I believe our colleagues in the Conference who represented the other side entertained, something not very far short of a sanguine hope that such a settlement might be reached."</quote>
Well, if that is a faithful account of what took place, is it conceivable that, the Conference having failed, we are now going to revert to a condition of war a <i>outrance</i>&#x2014;to a condition of things such as the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0039"/>
<col>27</col>
noble Earl, perhaps thoughtlessly, suggested, when he told us last November that no alternatives were to be discussed, no amendments to be proposed, because it would be waste of time? May I use a simile suggested by a matter which I have been discussing? I cannot bring myself to believe that the noble Earl who, in the calm waters of the Conference, was sailing as a peaceful trader with a cargo of all the Christian virtues, should now reappear amongst us as a belligerent laden with combustibles and munitions of war destined for the destruction of the House of which he is himself a distinguished ornament.<lb/>
But other things have taken place besides the Conference since these proposals first saw the light. There have been two General Elections. The General Election of January, 1910, dissipated two-thirds of your great majority. A majority of 354 became a majority of 124, a majority composed entirely of your Home Rule and Labour supporters, who acknowledge no real allegiance to you. In December, 1910, you thought you would try your luck again. You were in a hurry. You could not wait for the new register. Why were you so anxious to go to the country again? Ministers themselves explained their reasons with the utmost frankness. I think it was the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who said that they desired to receive a greater measure of authority from the people of this country. It was the Prime Minister who said that they sought for a more emphatic pronouncement of the good will of the people. Did they get it? What they wanted&#x2014;and there can be no doubt about it&#x2014;was to get a majority which would emancipate them from the control of the factions upon whom they are now obliged to depend. Are they emancipated? My Lords, the yoke sits exactly where it sat, and if His Majesty's Ministers flinch in their progress they will find that the same whip is cracked on their flanks, the same spur is driven into their sides.<lb/>
My Lords, something else has happened since these proposals first saw the light. We have made proposals of our own. We have made it perfectly clear to you that we are ready to meet you and to discuss with you such changes as may he necessary, first in the constitution of this House, and next, in the procedure for settling the rela-
<col>28</col>
tions between the two Houses. Are all these proposals to be brushed on one side as though they were not worth the paper on which they are written? We are told that our proposals are vague. I am afraid that my rejoinder to that is that many of you have not been good enough to read them. We are told that there is no common ground between you and us. No common ground, my Lords&#x0021;Have noble Lords opposite never heard of such things as conferences between the two Houses? Have they never discussed the possibility of a joint sitting of the two Houses, and if it comes to a question of the reform of this House, what, I ask, is the meaning of the Preamble of their own' Bill if it does not mean&#x2014;and I think the noble Lord the seconder of the Address felt that as he spoke&#x2014;that the question of House of Lords reform is intimately mixed up with all these other questions? If the Preamble of your Bill is an honest Preamble, it means this, that no final settlement of this question is possible until the question of House of Lords reform has been dealt with. If I am right in saying that, then surely it follows inexorably that this Parliament Bill of yours is a stopgap Bill and ought to be treated as such&#x2014;that it ought to he treated as a Bill for establishing a <i>modus vivendi</i> between the two Houses pending a solution of the larger question of House of Lords reform. But is the Parliament Bill a stopgap Bill? It is, on the contrary, a Bill for breaking down the barrier and admitting the full flood tide of revolution into our institutions.<lb/>
I await with intense interest the speech which the noble Earl will presently make to us. I trust he will lay to heart what was said by the noble Lord who seconded the Address. The noble Lord told us that he trusted that a spirit of reason would prevail. We not infrequently notice with pleasure that words of candid friendship fall from the Benches behind noble Lords opposite. I trust the spirit of reason will prevail&#x2014;I trust that the spirit of the Conference will prevail, and not the spirit of the hustings. If the spirit of the hustings prevails, you may get a settlement, but it will be a settlement which will settle nothing; and the reason why it will settle nothing is this, that it will not have behind it those sanctions which have secured in the past history of our country, even for bitterly debated and highly controversial measures, a permanent and un

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00198"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is my first duty, and it is a pleasant one, to join with the noble Marquess opposite in congratulating my two noble friends behind me on the manner in which they discharged their difficult task. I think that even those who have been longest members of your Lordships' House will be disposed to agree that they have seldom heard the duty discharged more gracefully and in better taste. My noble friend Lord Ilkeston is an old Parliamentary hand, having sat almost continuously in another place since the last Reform Bill, and having there given close attention to and done valuable work in connection with local government and social reform. My noble friend the seconder has also had no inconsiderable Parliamentary experience, but he has also had the advantage of having for three years filled a responsible place in one of the great Dominions, as I think he indicated to us in the course of his speech. I join with the noble Marquess opposite in hoping that both noble Lords will often take part in our debates&#x2014;a wish which he and I have both on former occasions frequently expressed in reference to the mover and seconder of the Address, but one which has not always been gratified in after years.<lb/>
We are all in accord with the solemn words of the first paragraph of the gracious Speech. When His Majesty speaks of the loss he has sustained, we, too, know what we have lost, and I am quite certain that none of us will ever forget the stately aspect of the regal figures which stood there [indicating the Throne] last year, and will not stand there again. But, my Lords, we must look forward, and those of us who witnessed the ceremony of to-day, not less splendid and not less dignified, will all join with the whole of the House in wishing that for many years to come His Majesty and his gracious Consort may perform that most significant Constitutional act, when the Sovereign, in addressing the Estates of the Realm, speaks to the people and for the people over whom he rules. And I think that many of those who were present to-day could not avoid a feeling of gratification and relief in observing that when His Majesty declared
<col>30</col>
himself a faithful defender of that palladium of our Constitution, the Protestant Succession, he was able to do so, thanks to the measure which your Lordships almost unanimously joined in passing, without giving pain or offence to any section of his subjects.<lb/>
The next paragraph of the Speech deals with the visit of the illustrious Duke to South Africa. We have had the advantage of hearing from the illustrious Duke himself, when he was entertained by the City of London, his experiences of that tour; but we are happy in this place also to express our sense of the great Imperial service which he thereby performed in taking the place which His Majesty was unhappily prevented from taking himself. I have every reason to know, as indeed we have all heard, that the reception given to His Royal Highness and the illustrious ladies who accompanied him was through out of the most cordial character. I cannot help thinking that nothing can have struck His Royal Highness more in the course of that tour than the fact that just as he went through his work there and spoke as man to man without any feeling in his mind of differences of race among those whom he addressed, so no differences of race were allowed to interfere with the cordiality of the welcome he received. Perhaps I may be allowed to add a word of gratification that the illustrious Duke was enabled to visit Rhodesia, a country of which we entertain high hopes, and which is now, I hope, able to speak of itself as looking forward with a rising barometer.<lb/>
As the noble Marquess observed, the phrase in the Speech that the relations of the Crown with foreign Powers continue to be friendly is one almost of common form. But I hope it may be taken on this occasion as meaning a little more than common form, as meaning that where any difficulties have existed there is a cordial and active desire to diminish and even if possible to sweep them away. The noble Marquess has alluded to the Japanese Treaty. I am afraid I am not in a position to go into any detail on that subject, owing to the fact that the negotiations are not concluded. But I am certain that. although the matter, as the noble Marquess pointed out, must be a difficult one, our Japanese friends have entered into the negotiations with every desire to
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0041"/>
<col>31</col>
meet us and the claims and necessities of our trade, so far as it is possible for them to do so.<lb/>
The only other topic of foreign affairs mentioned in the Speech is that of Persia. The question of the southern roads of Persia has, of course, caused His Majesty's Government great anxiety, and my right hon. friend has received many communications from Chambers of Commerce and other bodies interested in trade, complaining of the state of things on the trade roads in Southern Persia. We have to bear in mind that in such a country as Persia political unrest has effects upon trade which it need not necessarily have in more settled countries. It would be quite possible in some countries to have no inconsiderable degree of political unrest existing and yet for trade to be carried on as usual; but in a country like Persia, where trade is carried on by means of caravans and where the form which unrest takes is attack by tribesmen on those caravans, the difficulties of the Central Government react at once and on the largest scale upon the trade of the country. That is the reason why we have felt ourselves obliged to make representations to the Persian Government. At the same time, there has been some improvement, and we desire, as the noble Marquess, I think, seemed to consider not unreasonable, to be as patient as possible in this matter. It would be, I confess, with no little reluctance&#x2014;and here I speak also from the point of view of the Department which I have the honour to represent&#x2014;that we would undertake even the moderate step of lending Indian officers for the purpose of organising Persian police&#x2014;a step which was indicated as possible by my right hon. friend the Secretary of State&#x2014;because we desire as far as possible to see Persia self-sustained and progressing on her own lines through her own people. Of course the time may come when it may be necessary for us, and when Persia may fully agree, that some outside aid is required. But I repeat there is no desire on our part to offer that particular aid even to so moderate an extent.<lb/>
The Speech goes on to speak of two events of the highest Imperial interest which are to take place within the present year. The first is the Imperial Conference which has now, I hope, come to be regarded as a matter of course. It has ceased to be
<col>32</col>
the nine-days wonder that it was when it was first initiated, and it is looked upon now perhaps with less excitement, but; certainly with no less interest, and in a more businesslike fashion. Since the last meeting of the Conference there has been a continuous interchange of communication between this country and the self-governing Dominions upon many points of interest likely to be raised at the coming Conference, and there have also been subsidiary Conferences dealing with important questions, as, for instance, Imperial defence and international copyright. One thing I may venture to say about the coming Conference, and it is this, that I hope an agreement will be reached to render it less socially strenuous to those who take part in it than past Conferences have been. It must be remembered that the Ministers who come here representing the great Dominions are not all of them young men or strong men; and although we quite understand the very natural and praiseworthy desire of all manner of societies, associations, and clubs to entertain and do honour to our distinguished visitors, I hope that some self-denial will be exercised by those bodies, and that we may arrive at an agreement only to do honour to the Colonial Ministers on some few occasions which may be described as almost of national importance. When you come to think of it, it is not really a compliment to these gentlemen, whom we ought to regard as our fellow-subjects and fellow-workers, to treat them as we might treat sonic distant Oriental potentate who came to England for the first and only time, whereas the oftener we see our friends from the Dominions the better we are all pleased.<lb/>
Then the Speech goes on to mention the forthcoming visit of His Majesty to India to hold a Durbar and there announce the ceremony of his Coronation. I am glad to be able to say that active steps are already being taken in India in making arrangements for the great celebration at Delhi. They have been placed in the charge of a committee presided over by one of the most able of Indian officials, Sir John Hewett, and under the close personal supervision of my noble friend the Viceroy. We hope, therefore, that the arrangements will be found to be worthy of the occasion, and that they will carry out what seem to me to be the two conditions which are needed for such a ceremony&#x2014;in the first place, that the actual func-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0042"/>
<col>33</col>
tion should be of the most stately and dignified character; and secondly, that as many as possible of His Majesty's Indian subjects should have the opportunity of looking on the face of their Emperor. Perhaps before I leave the subject of India I may he allowed also to express our gratification at the successful and enjoyable tour which His Imperial Highness the German Crown Prince has lately taken in that country.<lb/>
The noble Marquess commented upon the somewhat jejune character of the sentences in the Speech addressed to the Gentlemen of the House of Commons, and pointed out that in former years it was almost the invariable custom to state that the Estimates had been framed with a due regard to economy. Perhaps it was, but I do not know that it was always true, and in the circumstances it is perhaps as well that the statement should not become a common form in the Speech. We hope, indeed, that when the Estimates are presented to the House of Commons they will he found to have been framed with a due regard to economy, because, after all&#x2014;and I know I shall have the approval of your Lordships in this&#x2014;it is not always the lowest Estimates which are the most economical. But, of course, it is everybody's desire to keep the Estimates down as far as possible. The noble Marquess digressed somewhat into a disquisition on the treatment of Parliament with reference to finance. It is quite true that the whole Parliamentary situation on the subject of finance has become anomalous and inconvenient. But we on this side of the House trace that. unfortunate circumstance to the rejection by your Lordships of the Budget of 1909. When the noble Marquess speaks of the Budget of the now current year as not yet having been passed, he is aware, of course, that that phrase is liable to some misunderstanding. No tax is standing over; all the taxes are now collected by the law of the land; and although it is true that certain matters of machinery were left over by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for discussion in another place, yet to speak of the Budget as not having been passed seems to me to be a scarcely accurate description of the situation as it is.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess spoke of the two Bills which find a place after the notice of the Constitutional measure. Cer
<col>34</col>
tainly we do not anticipate that any serious objection will be taken from the other side to the measure for securing the permanent provision of old-age pensions for those disqualified by reason of having received poor relief, because those who look back to the debates on the Old-Age Pensions Bill in another place will recall that such was the anxiety at that time shown by some supporters of noble Lords opposite for the inclusion of this particular provision in the measure, that, although they were told that at that time no money was forthcoming for the purpose, they were quite ready to imperil the entire measure in order to get that provision inserted. Therefore we feel sure that on this occasion we shall enjoy their warm support. The questions of insurance against invalidity and unemployment are of the greatest gravity and importance, and I was grateful to the noble Marquess for the assurance that they would receive fair consideration at the hands of your Lordships. They are questions of the greatest difficulty. They have been solved to some extent in some countries. In Germany a solution which I believe is not an unsatisfactory one has been found. In Switzerland, unless I am mistaken, a strongly-backed demand for something of the kind failed when it was submitted to the panacea of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;namely, the Referendum. The difficulty which surrounds these questions is that, demanding as they do the active concurrence and co-operation of the working classes themselves, they are not measures which in any sense can he imposed on the country by Parliament. There already exist great, and in many ways most successful, agencies for dealing with sickness; and it is an indispensable condition, if these measures are to be carried at all, that the great mass of public opinion, including those who have hitherto done so much by purely voluntary effort, should be enlisted in their support. The object is one, I think, to which the best wits and brains of the country may most usefully be applied. These are in no sense Party measures, and I hope, therefore, that they will be carried to a conclusion without arousing any kind of Party feeling.<lb/>
Next the noble Marquess asked me about sonic measures which do not appear in the King's Speech. I think that since some years ago the habit has arisen of including an almost excessive number of measures in the gracious Speech. The
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0043"/>
<col>35</col>
Speech may seem, and evidently does seem, to the noble Marquess opposite to err in the opposite direction. But we have, in view of the great Constitutional question, on which I shall say a word directly, abstained from going beyond those measures which, as the Speech says, are presented "in pursuance of intentions already declared." But I am able to answer the noble Marquess's question as regards the payment of Members. It undoubtedly is the intention of His Majesty's Government to deal with that question, as was categorically stated by my right hon. friend the Prime Minister during the course of the last Session, and it is our intention to deal, to the extent which was stated by the Prime Minister on the same occasion, with the situation created by the Osborne judgment.<lb/>
With regard to payment of Members the noble Marquess spoke with some severity, and he looked forward sadly to a time when the House of Commons would be&#x2014;I think the word "degraded" would perhaps not be too strong to use&#x2014;by the adoption of this particular reform. I quite admit that, to all of us, the idea of gratuitous service, so freely rendered as it has been in this country by those who are able to give it, is an attractive one, and we all I think lament it when the time arrives in any particular case when a change has to be made. But if it can be pointed out that by depending on gratuitous service only you are, in effect, depriving a large number of persons who might be good and worthy members of Parliament of an opportunity of filling that position, then, however reluctantly, you may have to give up your old system. I cannot forget that there are many, including active and brilliant members of the Party of the noble Marquess, who are active supporters of this principle, and I have heard with some surprise the very doleful forecast which he gave of the probable results of this measure. I do not myself believe that those forecasts are justified. It is reasonable to remember that, although we may think that our Parliament is the best in the world, yet there are others which cannot be spoken of in terms of absolute contempt, including the Parliaments in our great Dominions, and including, for instance, that South African Parliament which we inaugurated the other day with so much enthusiasm and good will. Well, those are all paid, and I think it would rather surprise our
<col>36</col>
coming visitors from the Colonies if they had to believe that we regarded their Assemblies with almost the contempt which the noble Marquess seemed to pour upon a paid Assembly. The noble Marquess said&#x2014;"Where are you going to stop; how are you going to avoid paying county councils and other bodies?" Well, in the case of foreign countries and in the great self-governing Dominions those bodies also exist, but they are not paid, and I think it will be found that all over Canada and Australia the municipal bodies equivalent to our county councils are in the main unpaid bodies. Therefore it does not seem as though that result need necessarily follow the institution of a system of payment of Members.<lb/>
I omitted to answer the question which the noble Marquess asked me with regard to the state of affairs in Macedonia. I can assure him that my right hon. friend and his Department will not fail to watch most carefully all the accounts which they receive of what is happening there. Nor, I think, shall I be wrong in saying that I am quite certain that if opportunity occurs my right hon. friend will not fail to convey to the Turkish Government the feelings of pain with which public opinion in this country must receive reports of the kind which the noble Marquess has mentioned&#x2014;assuming, of course, that those reports are well founded. We all, I am sure, hope that the Turkish Government will recognise the responsibility which they have for the fair treatment of all races and creeds in that part of the Empire over which the Sultan rules.<lb/>
My Lords, I now come to the Constitutional question. The mover of the Address dealt with the question very moderately and with a mature sagacity which, I feel sure, must have impressed the House. The noble Marquess asked whether the Parliament Bill will receive full discussion. It has already received and its principles have received some degree of discussion. The Resolutions upon which it is founded were discussed, I do not say at great length, but at some length, in another place and we had the somewhat short discussion in this House at the end of last Session&#x2014;a discussion which, of course, was shortened, so far as the Parliament Bill was concerned, by the fact that your Lordships desired to discuss a great many other topics besides the Bill itself. But it is certainly
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0044"/>
<col>37</col>
our desire that the Parliament Bill should receive a full measure of discussion both in another place and here, and so far as possible we shall do what we can to achieve that result.<lb/>
The position is somewhat changed from what it was when we separated last year. At that time I said that the Bill was placed before your Lordships' House, but that it was useless from our point of view at that time to begin amending it, because we had determined that the only possible course for us to take was to ask the opinion of the country on the subject. We asked for the opinion of the country and we got it. I look back to the year 1900. You asked for the opinion of the country; you got it, and with a somewhat reduced majority. I never heard it then hinted that you did not regard yourselves entitled to proceed with the task with which you considered yourselves to be entrusted by the country&#x2014;that of the settlement in South Africa&#x2014;and you proceeded with it on lines which were certainly not approved by a great number of people in the country. You also took advantage of that majority to deal with other large questions in the way which suited you best. What more can a Government ask when it goes to the country for a vote of confidence than to receive that vote of confidence?<lb/>
The noble Marquess talked of our having dropped our majority of 1906 when we went to the country in January, 1910. Does the noble Marquess imagine&#x2014;it is too great a compliment to us to suppose&#x2014;that the majority of 1906 represents the normal majority of the Liberal Party in this country? When we went to the country in 1906 we had the inestimable advantage of the fact that noble Lords opposite had been in office for ten years. I frankly admit that until that is repeated, as I suppose it will be some day, we shall never be able to hope for a similar result. We went to the country this time, as I say, for a vote of confidence. We had been given to understand, and I do not know that it has been contradicted, that the election of January, 1910, was considered to be a verdict for the Budget, but must not be taken as a verdict for very much else; and I feel perfectly certain that if we had chosen to go on and to discuss the Constitutional question, instead of advising His Majesty to dissolve Parliament, we should at every turn, in this House, in another place, and in the country, have
<col>38</col>
been perpetually met by the taunt&#x2014;"After all, you have no right to claim that you have the confidence of the country for this particular measure; what the country did say was that it liked various clauses of the Budget which the House of Lords did not like&#x2014;that is the only vote of confidence you have got, and you are not entitled to proceed with this Constitutional question." Now, at any rate, there is no dispute that the last election was fought on this Constitutional question, and having regard to the fact that all Governments as they go on tend to depreciate their own majority, tend to make enemies, tend to annoy powerful interests, I look upon it as one of the most remarkable instances of confidence in the whole history of this country that we should have been able to retain our majority unimpaired.<lb/>
The noble Marquess made a moving appeal to us about the Constitution. He quoted the words in the Speech&#x2014;
<quote>"the more effective working of the Constitution&#x2014;</quote>
as though it had worked arid would continue to work. But what are the noble Marquess's own proposals with regard to the Constitution? He is going to replace your Lordships' House, if he has the power, by what in the well-known phrase I may call a tesselated pavement&#x2014;a House composed of all manner of elements, of pieces of mosaic not altogether described; and what is more than that, he is going to ask both Houses of Parliament and the country to embark upon the most novel, and, as I think, the most dangerous experiment that has ever been tried in the Constitution of this country, in the form of a popular Referendum. After that it is really useless to speak of us as interfering with the Constitution, because whether you like our proposals or not, or whether you desire to suggest amendments to them&#x2014;to which, of course, we should respectfully listen&#x2014;I do not see how you can dispute it that the Constitutional changes proposed by noble Lords opposite are infinitely more far-reaching and strike harder and more deeply at the life of the Constitution than anything we have proposed.<lb/>
The noble Marquess mentioned two other subjects on which I ought to say a word. He spoke of the Declaration of London, and I was again grateful for a certain caution which he gave. So far as I have had the opportunity of reading comments upon the situation created by the promulgation of the Declaration of London,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0045"/>
<col>39</col>
it seems to me that many people are disposed to forget that it is not a question of our being able to promulgate and enforce a system of international law which we should select if we had the sole making of it, having regard to our dependence on foreign food supplies, to our insular position, and to our place as the greatest naval Power in the world; the question is&#x2014;are you going to get by international agreement, as international agreement there must be, some system which will place you in a stronger position, or at any rate in no worse a position, than if no such agreement was made? The question therefore to be asked of these provisions, of any particular provision, is whether it places us in a better or a worse position than if the Declaration of London were not promulgated and affirmed. I do not want to dwell on this subject now. In the first place, it is going to be discussed at the Imperial Conference, and in the second place there will be opportunities later before there is any question of its being ratified, of discussion both in another place and here.<lb/>
The other point to which the noble Marquess alluded was that of the arrangements between the United States and Canada. He spoke of them as having come about because Canada had knocked in vain at our door. I wonder if that is an observation which can be sustained by historical evidence. Does that mean to say that supposing we had entered into a preferential arrangement with Canada founded on the advantage of one or two shillings on Canadian wheat Canada would not be tempted at any time, or at any rate within any reasonable time, to enter into any agreement of Reciprocity with the United States? Can that be sustained? And supposing it could, would not the fact give rise to this further reflection&#x2014;supposing it were the case that Canada really was debarred by a treaty of a preferential character with us from entering into such an arrangement with the United States, though it would be advantageous for her to do so, as she now thinks, would that tend to strengthen the Imperial tie? This seems to me to be precisely one of the points on which we have always laid stress in speaking of this question&#x2014;that the time would come when your preferential arrangements would interfere with a great Dominion doing something which for other reasons it would wish to do; and I can
<col>40</col>
conceive that that might place a strain upon loyalty which it would be difficult to bear. I <ob/>ve an unbounded belief in the loyalty of the Canadian Dominion to the Imperial connection and to the Crown, and I do not myself see anything in this Reciprocity arrangement, even supposing it to come into force in the form in which it has been published, which need either at once or in the long run have any effect in weakening the tie between us and Canada. Although I do not expect to have convinced in every case noble Lords opposite, I hope I have not left untouched any topic raised in the noble Marquess's speech.</membercontribution></p>

I know there is a universal feeling of regret in the House at his absence from those duties which he performed so faithfully and efficiently.

<title>THE SUGAR-BEET INDUSTRY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00224"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member> rose to ask the following Question:&#x2014;"Having regard to the hopes held out by Ministers in both Houses of Parliament during the past Session as to the possibility of assisting the establishment of the sugar-beet industry in the British Isles by grants from the Development Fund, to ask His Majesty's Government whether they now consider that such a method of procedure is possible, and, if not, what they propose to do for the encouragement of an industry which would confer such benefits on our agricultural districts and on the country generally."</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00225">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I do not think that any apology is needed for bringing this question again before your Lordships' attention, because your Lord-
<col>44</col>
ships must be well aware from what you have seen in the daily Press that this question of establishing the sugar industry in the British Isles is one that has been occupying public attention in an increasing degree all over the country. Not only in the British Isles has it attracted attention, but I have been told by many people on the Continent that manufacturers, more especially in Germany, Austria, Belgium, and France, are watching us very closely, and with a certain amount of apprehension, because naturally they do not wish to see some of their best customers going away from them. But it is interesting to note that this increased attention has come about largely since the debate which took place in your Lordships' House last March, in the course of which I ventured to call attention to the fact that a new departure had taken place owing to Dutch manufacturers having come into the English market and invited farmers in East Anglia to grow beet-root for export to Holland, there to be manufactured into sugar. This attracted a great deal of notice all over the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00226">As a result a considerable number of experimental plots were at once put down, and several hundred acres of sugar-beet were grown by farmers for export to Holland. Particulars with regard to these various crops have been collected and published, as far as possible, by the National Sugar-Beet Council, of which I am the humble chairman, and which has been working in conjunction with the Central Chamber of Agriculture; and it is satisfactory to note that on the whole the results have been of a most encouraging nature in one sense&#x2014;namely, that they have effectually gone to disprove the contention' which has been so often raised that the English climate is in itself unfavourable to the cultivation of sugar-beet. I think we have effectually disproved that, although most people who knew anything about the matter were fully convinced of the fact before; and it is interesting to note that this fact has been fully brought out in an interesting article which appeared in the Journal of the Board of Agriculture for January, wherein they laid especial stress upon this question of climate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00227">In many parts of England, notably in Essex, Hereford, Somerset, and Cornwall, beet-root has been grown with a sugar percentage as high as 18 per cent.,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0048"/>
<col>45</col>
which is extremely good, and in those districts, and in many others, especially in Lincolnshire, crops of from 15 to 20 tons per acre, carrying quite good percentages of sugar, have been grown. There have been many disappointments, almost invariably caused through want of proper cultivation and lack of experience. The ground had been badly prepared; the seed was put in in many cases far too late; the weather was very unpropitious during last year; singling the roots&#x2014;an important operation&#x2014;was in many cases done carelessly and at random, and unless the roots are singled at the proper time it makes a considerable difference in the amount of sugar afterwards obtained. There has also been insufficient hoeing and weeding, and in many cases the proper implements were not used a lid the labourers were devoid of all practical experience. But this broad fact has been undoubtedly proved, that sugar-beet can be grown in this country, and that all that we require at the present moment is the necessary capital, experience, and organisation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00228">Your Lordships will have noticed in the papers that there has been a great deal of talk of factories which were going to be put up. There was to be a factory in Essex, another in Worcestershire, and others in Lincolnshire and Sussex, but the regrettable fact is that none of these projects has materialised, and I do not think the reason is far to seek. The reason mainly is that in this industry you have to provide two profits&#x2014;a profit for the farmer and a profit for the factory. The farmers naturally want a good price. They are a bit sceptical as to the cost of cultivation, and before they embark on beet cultivation on a large scale they want to be assured of such a price as will cover them well. Then if the factories have to pay unduly high prices for their beet-root, it makes it more difficult for them in the early stages to get over those initial difficulties which are always present in the starting of any new industry. Obviously, if you cannot hold out inducements or hopes of good profits for the capitalist it is extremely difficult to get the capital necessary to erect factories, and it is very difficult to make any progress unless His Majesty's Government will give some material help.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00229">The reason why I venture to urge this question with so much persistence is that
<col>46</col>
we have to face two facts in this country. One is that the number of people engaged in agricultural occupations is about half what it was some fifty years ago; and the other is that whereas formerly we grew wheat for some twenty millions of our population, we now only grow wheat for between four and a-half and five millions of our people, and there are something like from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 acres of land that years ago were under corn crops which have now gone down in grass, and grass very often of an inferior description. I submit to your Lordships, as practical agriculturists most of you, that this is a very serious situation, and in war time we might bitterly regret the day when we had allowed so much of our corn land to go down in grass and reduced ourselves to growing such a very small amount of food for our own population.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00230">Then, again, you have the fact that sugar in itself is an article of necessity. Yet I wonder how many of our population realise that some five-sixths of the sugar which we consume in this country is beet sugar imported from the Continent of Europe. If that supply was interrupted and we continued to neglect the possibilities of growing it ourselves, you can imagine that a most serious rise in price might occur. Therefore from the point of view of economic supplies and the necessity of having our own sugar production I maintain that this is a very important question. I hope that at last His Majesty's Government are beginning to realise that fact, and to appreciate that this is no mere fad that I am venturing to bring before you, but a question of urgent national importance and one to which the Government of the day ought to pay attention. It is a question that has been recognised by all foreign Governments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00231">Help and encouragement have been freely given in every country except our own for the putpose of establishing the sugar industry. You have only to look at what has been clone in Germany, Austria, France, and America. On all hands it is admitted that wherever the industry has been established an enormous amount of good has been done, the value of the land has been raised, and land which was formerly out of cultivation has been brought into good agricultural value. There is plenty of laud in Germany at this moment which was formerly practically
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0049"/>
<col>47</col>
worthless and growing nothing, but which is now growing excellent crops entirely owing to the sugar-beet industry. I was at Magdeburg the other day, the centre of the German sugar industry, and was informed by one of the leading sugar authorities that if sugar-beet was not cultivated there the production of corn would probably go down some twenty per cent.; and if these results have been obtained in other countries I cannot for the life of me see why we cannot obtain similar results here in the British Isles in those districts where perhaps high farming has not been extensively practised and where the production of the land is by no means what it ought to be. I submit, therefore, most emphatically, that there is nothing which would more surely tend to gradually bring back under cultivation the grass land which has grown out of corn crops than the creation of a successful and profitable sugar industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00232">Last Session His Majesty's Government appeared to be gradually waking up to the importance of this matter, and vague hopes were held out in both Houses that perhaps something might be clone from the Development Fund, of which we have heard so much. I wish now to ask His Majesty's Government whether they are of opinion that this can practically be done. If it cannot, I want to know what it is that they propose as an alternative. I do not much care what the alternative is so long as it is practical and effective. I fear very much that it is not practicable to do anything from the Development Fund. In the first place, by the terms of the Act under which that Fund came into existence it is not allowable to devote money for the purpose of assisting an enterprise trading for profit. Well, the sugar industry is hardly likely to be a success in this country unless it not only trades for profit but at a profit. Then I have heard it suggested that perhaps grants might be given to farmers who grow the beet so that they could afford to take lower prices from the factories. There, again, you run up against the Brussels Convention, and I am told that such a grant would be regarded as a bounty within the terms of that Convention. There is another matter, and that is that when you start giving grants in that way it is very difficult to state to which factories you will give grants. Are you going to give a grant to anybody who might set
<col>48</col>
up a factory and put in a claim for it? I think the question of grants from the Development Fund is a very impracticable one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00233">What I am asking at the present moment is, What are the Government going to do? Are they going to do anything, or are we to be forced to the conclusion that all the talk which we have heard about assistance coming from the Development Fund is what our American cousins would call so much "hot air"? At the present moment, as I have pointed out, it is extremely difficult to make any further progress. Farmers cannot be induced to grow beet in sufficient quantities in the immediate neighbourhood of a factory unless they get a price which is hardly warranted by the present price of sugar; and when you ask capitalists to put up money for a factory, the first question they ask is, What are the Government going to do? We hear various rumours with regard to the remission of the Sugar Duty, but I wish to suggest that the Sugar Duty at the present moment&#x2014;it is only about a farthing in the lb.&#x2014;is no hardship whatever to individual consumers, and that the only people whom its abolition would practically benefit would be mineral-water manufacturers, wholesale confectioners, and jam makers, who no doubt constitute a very important branch of industry, and I might also, perhaps, include cocoa manufacturers, who also use sugar; but I do not think that the prospect of mineral-water manufacturers being able to make a larger profit than they do at the present time is a matter of such importance that it can be mentioned in the same breath with the question of doing something practical to revive the agriculture of the country. You cannot put the two questions alongside one another. Therefore I do maintain that there is no call whatever at the present moment to remit the Sugar Duty, although. I admit that a great many people on my own side of politics have talked rather freely on that question, mainly, I believe, because they were entirely ignorant of the possibilities of the sugar industry in this country, and because they understood that matter just as little as the members of His Majesty's Government. If you take off the Sugar Duty you leave us obliged to face a highly organised and scientific Continental industry on equal terms, and in the initial stages and until our people have obtained a sufficient amount of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0050"/>
<col>49</col>
experience I am afraid that would be a matter of very great difficulty. Even on the Continent, where the men are highly trained and where nearly everybody understands the industry, the factories did very badly in the first year or two, though when once well under weigh they have become most successful enterprises. How much more is this likely to be the case here in Great Britain?</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00234">I submit that if the sugar-beet industry could be treated as an infant industry, as laid down by Mill, and could be given the advantage of the Import Duty without an Excise for, say, five years, capital would be immediately forthcoming. That is a business proposal, although I see it greatly amuses the noble Earl the Leader of the House. The present Sugar Duty is nearly&#x00A3;2 a ton. No factory should be erected which is not capable of dealing with something like 5,000 tons of sugar in the year, and therefore the policy of leaving things as they are, which is what I hope His Majesty's Government will decide to do&#x2014;leaving the Sugar Duty on and leaving the question of Excise alone for four or five years&#x2014;would. make a difference of some&#x00A3;10,000 a year to a factory; in other words, it would make all the difference between profit and loss. So you see what an inducement that would be for people to come forward and invest money in this industry. I have no doubt I shall be told that other infants would immediately spring up and demand similar assistance, but I think the answer to that is very easy. There is all the difference in the world between taking advantage of a duty which is now in existence for the purpose of helping an industry and completely changing your policy and putting on other duties which do not exist simply and solely for purposes of Protection. I do not my-self see why there should be any further demand, for the simple fact that, with the exception, perhaps, of tobacco, there is no other article except sugar bearing a duty which is wholly imported from abroad and which could he manufactured in our own country. All I wish to do is to call attention to the importance and necessity of doing something practical to encourage the investment of money in factories, without which no further progress can be made, and I am anxious to know whether His Majesty's Government are prepared to treat this purely businesslike proposition in a businesslike way, and, if so, how it is they propose to do it.</p>
<col>50</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00235">I should like before I sit down to call special attention to the case of Ireland. Ireland is a purely agricultural country, and agriculture there is mainly dependent upon the cattle industry. How far it is wise to have all one's eggs in one basket is a matter worth consideration; but I know, although I have not particular-knowledge of the experiments made this particular year in Ireland, that beet has been grown there successfully, and that all the ideas about the Irish climate being unsuited for it are entirely exploded by the experience gained. I believe there is every indication that the sugar industry might flourish very well in Ireland, and I have seen it said on high authority that if it could be established there it might very likely have a far-reaching and lasting effect on the agriculture of the country.. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00236"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need hardly assure the noble Earl opposite that no one on these Benches looks upon his advocacy of the great sugar-beet industry as a mere fad. We all recognise his devoted efforts to propagate this industry, and I hope I may be permitted to compliment him on the excellent and interesting speech he has just made, and on the way in which he has placed his views before the House. I hope he will forgive me if I do not follow him into the question of the shortage of food in war time, or into the question whether or not it is absolutely necessary that more wheat should be grown in this country. May I also be excused from going into the large question of economic supplies. That the Government have taken practical interest in the agricultural industry is shown by the fact that a quarter of a million of public money has been cheerfully voted by the Commons House of Parliament for its advancement. A further sum of&#x00A3;50,000 a year has been also cheerfully voted for the purpose of promoting horse-breeding. The Advisory Council, a very strong body with Lord Middleton as Chairman and comprising the Duke of Portland, the Master of the Horse, and various well-known masters of hounds, held their first meeting to-day, and I trust that something very practical and satisfactory will result from their labours.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00237"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: How much of that money is going to the sugar industry?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0051"/>
<col>51</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00238"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl asks what assistance is going to be given by the Government towards the great industry of which he is the spokesman and advocate. Last year the noble Earl took me somewhat severely to task because we did not send what he called apostles into the country to preach the gospel of sugar-beet growing to the benighted inhabitants. I then reminded him that this had already been done by subsidising the agricultural colleges, which grow beet-root and spread the knowledge of its culture among farmers. I am able this year to go further, and to say that the Board of Agriculture propose to make arrangements for further experimental growth and to give publicity to that fact; but I venture to think with the noble Earl that the experimental time is somewhat over, and it is now generally known, thanks largely to the advocacy of the noble Earl and his colleagues, that very good sugar-beet of commercial quality can be grown in this country where the soil is suitable. What then is the next step? The next step, of course, is the establishment of factories for the extraction of the sugar. For that a certain amount of capital is required&#x2014;I am told that a sugar-beet factory ought not to be begun or run under a less capital than&#x00A3;100,000&#x2014;and so far private investors in this country have been unwilling to subscribe to any large amount. However, several companies have been started in the localities which were enumerated by the noble Earl, and the promoters of those companies are more or less sanguine as to the result. Now we are told that to crown the edifice His Majesty's Government are to give what the noble Earl calls practical assistance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00239"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: No company has yet been started.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00240"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: They are being started, I think. I understand that practical assistance is asked for to bring them to such a state as would be safe to start. The noble Earl made three suggestions, and I think my task has been considerably lightened because he answered the whole of his suggestions himself. His first suggestion was the provision of debenture capital by the Government. What does that mean in plain English? It means either a Government guarantee of a mortgage or the advance of Government money on mortgage. It is very doubtful whether, if noble Lords opposite were in office, they
<col>52</col>
would give a very satisfactory answer to the noble Earl on that point. As regards the suggested grant out of the Development Fund, the noble Earl again answered the suggestion and told us truly that no grant could be made out of the Development Fund to a company trading for profit; and if the noble Earl will read the words I had the honour of using this time last year he will see that there was no distinct promise, and that no words of mine can be twisted into a distinct promise, of any grant from the Development Fund for this purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00241"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: I never said that the Government made a promise. I said they held out hopes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00242"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: It comes to the same thing. The next suggestion was a bonus of so much an acre to farmers who grow sugar-beet. The noble Earl again told us that that was impossible, and that it was no use thinking about it, because, as he pointed out, under the Sugar Convention of 1903 no bounties of any sort can be given. We need, therefore, waste no time on that. I now come to the suggestion which the noble Earl calls both practical and effective. The Government have been up to the present very severely censured for not doing something. Yet what the noble Earl now asks the Government to do is to do nothing&#x2014;to leave things exactly as they are in the matter of the Sugar Duty for five years. There is a sweet reasonableness about that period, because in the debate last year doubt was expressed whether the time should not be extended to ten years. But now we are asked to leave things exactly as they are for five years. In other words, the Government are to pledge themselves for five years to give no relief from taxation to the consumers of sugar and to the great industries that are dependent upon it as a raw material. I speak under correction, but I believe the price of sugar has risen under the duty from&#x00A3;8 or&#x00A3;9 per ton to&#x00A3;14 or&#x00A3;16 per ton. Yet we are asked to do nothing in any circumstances to give relief to the great mass of the population who consume sugar or to the great industries of which sugar is the raw material. The noble Earl quoted Mill, and it all comes back to the old policy of dry-nursing infant industries. The noble Earl must know that with the old and exploded policy of dry-nursing an infant industry His Majesty's Government will have nothing to do. We cannot hold out
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0052"/>
<col>53</col>
any hopes of assistance in that direction. At the same time, I do recognise, and I think everybody will recognise, the efforts that the noble Earl has made to introduce a new, important, and what might be a most beneficial industry, and I should be the last person holding the office I have the honour to hold to throw cold water upon them. I do think that we owe him a debt of gratitude for his well-meant efforts, and if the prospects of the cultivation of sugar-beet are so promising as he represents them to be, then surely plenty of money will be forthcoming from private sources to foster and develop it, and the noble Earl will go down to posterity as a pioneer of a new industry and as a benefactor of the farmers of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00243"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who represents the Board of Agriculture has dealt, with obvious knowledge and in a very interesting manner, with the question which my noble friend brought forward, but he laid down some general propositions with which, speaking solely for myself, I certainly cannot agree. I understood him to pat his foot down, or, if we may use the classical phrase, to bang, bolt, and bar the door against any effort on the part of the Department which he represents to assist a new agricultural industry. He said he would have nothing whatever to do with the policy of dry-nursing an infant industry. There is dry-nursing and dry-nursing. I think we should all be agreed t hat it is the duty of any Government to be very careful how it advances public money in t he support of a new industry; but I, for one, protest altogether against the doctrine that it is not the function of the Board of Agriculture, at any time or in any circumstances, to assist into being a new branch of agriculture. How can the noble Earl lay down this old, time-honoured, but now absolutely musty, doctrine in the face of the experience of the world?<lb/>
Look at; the wonderful agricultural industry in Canada. Would that be what it is if the Canadian Government had adopted the views of the noble Earl? Do we not all know that agriculture placed in circumstances of great difficulty in modern times without Government assistance when it comes to organisation? That is the difficulty of your farmer&#x2014;the question of organisation. The man who tills the land has limited capital. He is not in that constant contact with his neighbours
<col>54</col>
engaged in the same trade as are the cotton-spinners of Lancashire or the iron-masters of Yorkshire. Communication and exchange of ideas are difficult. He is not in constant contact with people whose business it is to finance industry. Our Colonies have shown, and foreign countries have shown, that the comparatively slow development of agriculture has been largely due to that cause, because when Governments have come forward and assisted farmers to do that which they cannot do for themselves, agriculture has then flourished and extended the producing power of the country in a way which thirty years before was not thought possible.<lb/>
I speak with some warmth on this subject because I have had personal experience of what can be done by Government in the way of assisting the organisation of agriculture. My noble friend, like me, and long before me, has been to the further parts of His Majesty's Dominions and learnt many things there. It is less than six years ago that I had the honour of going to South Africa as High Commissioner. When I went there I believe there was not one single sack of mealies, or maize, exported from South Africa to Europe. Last year there were 2,000,000 sacks of maize exported, and that, my Lords, I venture to prophesy is only the commencement of one of the most important agricultural trades of the world. If the Minister for Agriculture for the Transvaal had held the same view as to the functions of Government as my noble friend opposite, if he also had rather have died in the last political ditch than break the principle of never supporting an infant industry, there would not be one single sack of maize exported from South Africa to-day. The whole of that trade was created by the Transvaal Government in conjunction, before the days of Union, with the other South African Governments. They brought the farmers together, they arranged the railway and shipping rates, they supplied the stores for the grain and the necessary machinery. The whole organisation was got into motion, and the farmers were told, "We have sent from the Government farms so many sacks of mealies to Europe; the quality is pronounced universally good, and the maize has at once stepped into the front rank in the European market, even in front of American maize. Now is your chance. All you have to do is to grow the right sort of maize, the seeds for which you can buy from the Government
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0053"/>
<col>55</col>
experimental farms, and put it on the railway. We [the Government] will do the rest for you." That action of the Government of the Transvaal stands a chance of giving to South Africa that same close settlement and intense cultivation which the cultivation of wheat has given to Canada. This wonderful economic transformation of South African agriculture has been entirely brought about by the action of the Government. Therefore I could not remain seated and without a protest listen to the noble Earl, here and in the twentieth century, laying down the doctrine that it is not the business of the Department of Agriculture to foster a national agricultural interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00244"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we have all heard with interest the speech just delivered by the noble Earl, embodying, as it did, so much of his own personal experience. But, interesting though his speech was, I am not certain that it was entirely relevant to the subject of the Question asked by the noble Earl opposite. After all, Lord Denbigh, in his interesting statement, asked the Government to do one definite thing. He passed in review the various courses which the Government might have followed, and for one reason or another he decided that they could not be adopted; and he came at last to the final question as to whether the Government would pledge themselves for a fixed term of years to continue to impose the duty upon all imported sugar. I do not know whether the noble Earl confined himself entirely to beet-sugar, or whether he meant to make the same preferential arrangement with regard to cane-sugar imported from various parts of the Empire; but, in any case, so far as foreign sugar was concerned the duty was to be maintained for a fixed term, and no equivalent. Excise duty was to be raised on home-grown sugar. That is a proposal which does not seem to me to stand in any close relation to what the noble Earl who has just sat down calls organisation of agriculture, in regard to which he complained of the dictum laid down by my noble friend behind me. The things of which the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, spoke may, and perhaps in some ways do, conceivably infringe the pure doctrine of Free Trade, but at any rate they are not the things which Lord Denbigh asks should be done. The noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite mentioned railway rates. Well, I suppose that all points in
<col>56</col>
the direction of a scheme which is desired by some, but not by all&#x2014;namely, the nationalisation of the English railways, and the consequent fixing of rates for the benefit of particular industries. The objection which has hitherto been taken to that scheme is that it is of too Socialistic a. character. Indeed, this is just one of those cases&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00245"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I did not advocate nationalisation of railways. I only mentioned that to show in how multifarious a manner the Government intervened to complete the organisation of the industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00246"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understood the noble Earl; but I wished to point out that so far as we are concerned here that particular form of assistance could only be given by adopting the large policy of nationalisation; and I was going on to say one sees how near Socialism and Protection approach when it comes to this question of the encouragement of industries, and the well-known saying of Bastiat that a Protectionist is a Socialist with an income of 50,000 francs a year seems to be exemplified by the character of the proposals made by the noble Earl who has just sat down.<lb/>
Then we come to a different branch of the question. Lord Denbigh's proposal is frankly Protectionist. Of course, we do not quarrel with the noble Earl for making it, but it is frankly protective; and I think we are entitled to say further that it is Protection applied in a peculiarly dangerous and damaging way, both to British industries and to the British consumer. It is impossible to forget that when Mr. Chamberlain, in the autumn of the year 1903, developed his policy in two great speeches, one delivered at Glasgow and the other at Greenock, he particularly mentioned the Sugar Tax as one of those which he desired to do away with in consideration of the imposition of a tax upon corn, meat, and dairy produce; and we have understood to this day, because it has since been confirmed by Mr. Balfour and others who have spoken on behalf of the Tariff Reform creed, that if it were found that the food of the working-classes was in any way increased in price by the adoption of Mr. Chamberlain's policy, it was to sugar and tea that you were to look for a reduction of taxation to redress the balance in the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0054"/>
<col>57</col>
working-man's budget. That possibility is to be finally abandoned in order to give this particular industry of sugar growing in this country an extra chance. One is tempted to ask noble Lords opposite who would be responsible for the financial affairs of this country if they came into power whether they would be prepared to do what the noble Earl now desires. Then the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, spoke somewhat slightingly, as he was almost bound to do for the purposes of his argument, of the different industries which flourish when the price of sugar is low.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00247"><member>THE EA RL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: I did not speak slightingly of them. I said they were very important industries, but not so important as the agricultural industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00248"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I agree that it was purely by comparison that the noble Earl sought to prove that the industry of sugar growing in this country was more important than the possible damage to t hose great industries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00249"><member>THE EARL, OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00250"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I have, of course, no facts or figures at my disposal here, because I never intended to take any part in this debate, but I should very much doubt whether there was any prospect of sugar-beet growing in this country, even under the favourable circumstances which the noble Earl suggests, ever becoming an industry which would compete, on the mere question of employment and the number of labourers involved, with those great industries which depend upon cheap sugar. And, of course, apart from that, there is the question to which I have already alluded, that of the interests of the consumer, which are to be compromised for a term of five years. I really think that noble Lords opposite will agree that if we are to be asked to depart from Free Trade this is a somewhat extreme instance in which to begin to ask us to do it, because it is not merely that we are to compromise the Free Trade doctrine in respect of a particular industry, but we are also to tie our hands when it is a question of giving relief to a large class of consumers, with the further possibility of inflicting considerable damage on existing industries. In those circumstances I do not think the noble Earl, although I can quite understand that lie is disappointed with our answer, can wonder that it has taken the form which it has.</membercontribution></p>
<col>58</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00251"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who leads the House has devoted his observations almost entirely to the particular proposal which my noble friend behind me (Lord Denbigh) has made to your Lordships&#x2014;namely, the suggestion that His Majesty's Government should promise for a period of five years, at any rate, not to alter the present Sugar Duty, and not to impose an Excise duty on sugar grown in this country. I am somewhat in sympathy on that subject with the views of the noble Earl opposite, for this reason&#x2014;without entering upon the question of Free Trade or Protection&#x2014;that I do not think it would be possible either for the present Government, or for any Government likely to succeed them to make the promise which my noble friend Lord Denbigh desires. I think am right in saying that the present Government, through their spokesman in the House of Commons, have thrown out a suggestion, if not a promise, when the finances of the country permit to abolish, the existing duty on sugar, and, as my noble friend behind me admitted, what has been said by those who represent the Opposition in the House of Commons on this subject has pointed to their intention to do very much the same thing. I deeply regret that. I was responsible for the imposition of the Sugar Duty at the time of the South African war. It was supported by the highest financial authority of the Opposition of that day, Sir William Harcourt, and I believe that no better duty was ever proposed or carried by Parliament. Therefore I deeply regret to think that both sides are to a certain extent pledged by what they have said to its repeal at some future date. But that is the fact, and therefore I am not surprised at what the noble Earl has just said with regard to the position of the Government on that subject.<lb/>
But the noble Earl went on to attack my noble friend who sits on this Bench, and who has during the last six years governed South Africa with so much distinction. The noble Earl took him to task for suggestions which he made, not in regard to the proposal of my noble friend Lord Denbigh, but for some kind of assistance to the sugar-beet industry in this country in the way of organisation, and even in dealing with railway rates. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said that if you attempt to deal with
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0055"/>
<col>59</col>
railway rates in this matter you are suggesting Socialistic doctrines which are even worse than Protection. I happen to remember that as President of the Board of Trade, a good many years ago now, I was the responsible Minister for carrying a Bill through Parliament which laid down the rates for all the railways in the Kingdom on every conceivable subject they carried on their lines. Was that Socialistic, or was that nationalisation of railways? It is perfectly possible, if the Government of the day think it desirable, to establish a new and lower rate by legislation for sugar-beet over the railways, without any question whatever of Socialism or nationalisation of the railways. I think there was something wanting in the speech of the noble Earl. It was frankly admitted by the President of the Board of Agriculture that it has been proved that sugar-beet can he successfully cultivated in this country. Well, that is a very important admission. Everybody admits nowadays, even the most bigoted Free Traders, that anything that can be reasonably done by the Government to assist and improve the present position of agriculture in this country is very desirable. If a great new industry like the production of sugar-beet could be introduced it would give employment, and utilise the land in a way in which it is not now being. used.<lb/>
Why cannot the Development Grant be utilised in some way for this purpose? My noble friend said it was because nothing from that Fund can be devoted to a company that is "trading for profit." I remember that while that Bill was passing through your Lordships' House I moved the omission of those words, or their alteration in a way which would have permitted the employment of the Development Fund to assist in starting the sugar-beet industry. That Amendment was inserted by your Lordships. It went down to another place, and I need not say that, with all our other Amendments, it disappeared from the Bill when it became law. Is it impossible for His Majesty's Government to consider whether, through the promotion of some kind of agricultural organisation which might be of enormous advantage to the occupiers of small holdings&#x2014;for I believe the cultivation of sugar-beet is precisely one of the kinds of cultivation which can be dealt with by small holders&#x2014;they could
<col>60</col>
not do something towards giving this important industry a fair start? Would that be contrary to the principles of Free Trade? Would it not be doing precisely what every one has a right to expect, and what I am sure the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture would be himself the first to desire? I hope His Majesty's Government will not consider this question concluded, but that they will see whether, following the example of my noble friend Lord Selborne in South Africa and the Governments who acted under him, they cannot do something to promote the sugar-beet industry in this country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00253">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Question that stands in my name deals with a matter that has excited great interest, discussion, and diversity of opinion in Paris, Berlin, and St. Petersburg, and as we are as deeply concerned as the countries of which those cities are the capitals I think I may be excused in asking His Majesty's Government whether they can give the House any information on this rather important subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00254"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend might well have called this not only a rather important but a very important subject. Its importance is partly a reason why my answer must he brief, and, I am afraid, rather disappointing. It is this: Discussions on this subject between Germany and Russia are still proceeding and I am in no position to make any statement as to negotiations of a confidential character between two foreign Governments. That, I think, is pretty obvious. As regards

<title>THE DEATH OF EARL CAWDOR.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00265"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel certain that your Lordships will not desire to proceed to the business of the day without some reference being made to the sad event which we have all noticed in the newspapers of this afternoon. The long struggle which Lord Cawdor carried on against a fatal illness, carried on, as we were told, with the patience of a gallant spirit, has terminated. The career of Lord Cawdor was in some respects a unique one. There have been instances&#x2014;there are some among men prominent in public life to-day&#x2014;of those who have achieved high office without having climbed up any of the rungs of the official ladder, but I cannot recall any other instance of a man who, after a career of nine years in the House of Commons, hardworking and creditable, but not, I think, specially distinguished, then left active politics for a period of some twenty years, during which he devoted himself to local affairs and to the presidency of a great railway company, a post filled by him with the utmost distinction&#x2014;who at the end of that time was called to one of the highest and most responsible offices under the Crown&#x2014;who only held that office for a short time, but held it long enough to impress upon it his personality and to cause all those who were associated with him to regard him as one of the most capable Ministers who had ever been at the Admiralty.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0059"/>
<col>67</col>
Since then, and after that brief period of office, Lord Cawdor has held a position in the Party of noble Lords opposite and in the public esteem only very short of the highest. My Lords, that is a very remarkable career. We on this side have always recognised Lord Cawdor as a most formidable antagonist, but though his weapons were sharp, they were never barbed; in short, we recognised throughout his public career those same qualities of courage, straightforwardness, and invincible good humour which so endeared him to his friends in private life. I have one special qualification in speaking of Lord Cawdor. I was associated with him during the long days of the Constitutional Conference, and the noble Marquess opposite is the only other man in this House who can say the same. The noble Marquess can speak, and doubtless will speak, of the ability and of the originality of mind which Lord Cawdor showed during the progress of those negotiations, as on other occasions; but I am able to speak from a different standpoint of his breadth of view and that receptive quality of his mind which caused him to examine closely and even sympathetically all propositions that were set before him, even by those to whom he was at the time being opposed. So while we offer to noble Lords opposite our most sincere condolences upon the, as I hold, irreparable loss which they have sustained, we claim for ourselves also a share in the general sorrow which I know the House feels without exception at the bereavement which it has suffered in the death of Lord Cawdor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00266"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that it should have fallen to the lot of the noble Earl who leads the House to bring this sad subject before us, because he is able to address himself to it, not as we might have done as political allies of the late Lord Cawdor, but as the leader of the whole House. In that capacity he is able to bear witness to the extent of the loss which we have all sustained, and, as he has truly said, it is an irreparable loss. I do not think there is any member of your Lordships' House who has not during the last few weeks followed anxiously, amidst hopes and fears, the progress of that illness which Lord Cawdor resisted with peculiar and indomitable courage, but to which he has succumbed at last. As to Lord Cawdor's position in this House, I think it would be true to say that if any of us, no matter in what part of the House we sit,
<col>68</col>
had been called upon to draw up a list, a very short list, of the most able and conspicuous members of this Assembly, not one of these lists would have been found to have omitted Lord Cawdor's name. Lord Cawdor was an admirable debater&#x2014;ready, fearless, eloquent: a hard fighter who never was happier than when he was in the fighting line, but a fighter who, as the noble Earl truly said, always fought fairly. He had business abilities of no ordinary description. My noble and learned friend behind me (Lord Halsbury) would, I believe, be ready to testify to the manner in which he devoted himself at one period of his career to the business of his own county. In the management of his own great estates he showed the same thorough and businesslike disposition; and when lie undertook the affairs of that great railway company to which reference has been made it was by his businesslike ability that its position was so greatly improved. At the Admiralty he showed what he was able to do as the administrator of one of the most onerous Departments in the public service. I listened with interest and pleasure to the words which fell from the noble Earl in that part of his speech which dealt with the part taken by Lord Cawdor in the discussions of the Constitutional Conference. I gladly bear out every word that the noble Earl said upon that subject. But while we think of Lord Cawdor's many public qualities we also cannot help at this moment thinking of some of those personal qualities to which he owed so much of his popularity. Those who knew him intimately will, I am sure, agree with me when I say that there never was a more delightful companion or a more invaluable friend and counsellor. In all capacities of life he discovered the secret of attracting to himself the respect and affection of those with whom he came in contact; and perhaps my testimony on this point is worth something, for my acquaintance with Lord Cawdor dates from the time when we were boys together at school. Looking back upon t hat long vista of years I can recall no moment when Lord Cawdor was not surrounded by devoted friends, and when it would not have been true of him to say that he did not know how to make an enemy. To us who sit upon this Bench, Lord Cawdor's death is indeed a calamity. "We loved him; peace be with him; he is dead"; and we offer our sympathy to all those, to his family above all, but to all those who are mourning his loss at this sad hour.</membercontribution></p>

I sat with him for thirteen years as a member of the same County Bench, and then, as always, he appeared to me a true type of the English gentleman.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MILITARY ESTABLISHMENTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00268"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War the Questions standing in my name on the Paper&#x2014;viz.:
<ol>
<li>1. The total number of non-commissioned officers and men serving in the Regular Army in the United Kingdom on 1st February, 1911.</li>
<li>2. The number of the above under twenty years of age.</li>
<li>3. The number of non-commissioned officers and men due to proceed abroad before the end of the present trooping season.</li>
<li>4. The total number of officers, noncommissioned officers, and men deficient in all branches, combatant and non-combatant, of the Territorial Force on the 1st January, 1911.</li>
<li>5. The number of non-commissioned officers and men now serving in the Territorial Force under twenty years of age.</li>
<li>6. The number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men in the Territorial Force who have not completed their recruit's course of musketry.</li>
<li>7. The number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men in the Territorial Force who in 1909&#x2013;1910 failed to reach the qualifying standard for musketry, but who were afterwards, in accordance with Army Order 38 of 1910, returned as qualified, and the number who did not attempt to qualify under Army Order 38 of 1910.</li>
<li>8. The number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Territorial Army who have been absent with and without leave from camp on two occasions during their service.</li>
</ol>
<col>70</col>
The Questions need no explanation, as the information I seek is a more matter of numbers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00269"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the first three Questions of the noble Duke only the January figures are available. As to the first Question, the answer is 120, 837 non-commissioned officers and men. The answer to the second Question is 26,720 rank and file only, not including non-commissioned officers, but, of course, they are very few indeed in number. in answer to the third Question, the number of non-commissioned officers and men due to proceed abroad between January 1 and the end of the season is 3,523. As to Question four, the Territorial Force was below its establishment on January 1 by 1,514 officers and 44,106 non-commissioned officers and men. As to Question five, the latest figures obtainable are those of October 1 last, when 83,088 non-commissioned officers and men out of a strength of 257,337 were under twenty. The officers' ages are not available. As to Question six, out of a total strength of 73,813 officers and men who fired the recruits' course last year, 13,033 did not complete it. That does not mean that they did no musketry at all. Some may have done a good deal, but they did not complete the course. The Army Order to which the noble Duke refers in his seventh Question was issued in the month of February&#x2014;that was, before the musketry of the year had begun&#x2014;and therefore I think all the recruits who fired last year fired under the conditions of that Order. The number who did not attempt to qualify under that Order I cannot give; but the number of those who did not complete, though they may have attempted to do so, was 6,263. I am afraid I am unable to answer the eighth Question, as it would require a special return, which would take a great. deal of compiling. Of course, I can give, and have given, the number of men who did not attend camp in any particular year, but I cannot find out how far the men who did not attend camp in one year were the same who did not attend in another without asking for a special return.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LOCAL FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00334"><member>LORD BELPER</member> rose to move to resolve "That it is desirable that a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament be appointed to inquire into the application of the provisions contained in the Local Government Acts, 1888 and 1804, and the Local Government (Scotland) Acts, 1889 and 1894, relating to financial adjustments consequent on the alteration of the boundaries of a local government area or on an alteration in the constitution or <i>status</i> of the governing body of a local government area, and to report to the House if they are of opinion. that any amendments in such provisions are desirable."</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00335">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Motion which I have put on the Paper is the same Motion which was agreed to at the latter part of last session and in precisely the same terms, and is for the purpose of setting up a Joint Committee to try and solve the vexed question with regard to financial adjustments between counties and county boroughs in the case of extension or alteration of the boundaries of areas. This Motion was accepted last session by His Majesty's Government. Since then I have heard some criticism of the wording of the Motion, and the point has been raised whether the words "financial adjustments" need necessarily include the question of compensation, which is one of the questions with which it was obviously intended the Joint Committee should deal, because its suggested appointment arose out of the difficulties which had arisen between boroughs and counties in consequence of the judgment of the House of Lords in the Hartlepool case. In my view it is perfectly clear from the wording of the Motion that the Joint Committee would he appointed for the purpose of considering the whole subject, including the question whether or not compensation should be payable. Indeed, if that were excluded the appointment of the Joint Committee would be absolutely futile. Therefore I cannot conceive that there is any necessity to alter the wording of the Motion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00336">May I also remind the House that nearly every speaker both here and in another place specially alluded, in discussing this
<col>74</col>
subject, to the question of compensation, and as far as I myself was concerned that was the whole of my case in bringing forward the Motion, the difficulty having arisen in consequence of the judgment to which I have referred and in which it was decided that compensation could not he paid in these cases for loss of area or rateable value. I would further remind the noble Earl the Leader of the House that the President of the Local Government Board stated, in the discussion on the subject in the other. House, that he intended to refer the vexed question of compensation to county authorities for loss of rateable value to a strong and impartial Joint Committee of both Houses and that it would be set up as soon as possible. Unless, therefore, there is any authority in this House who thinks it necessary to make an alteration in the wording of the Motion as it stands on the Paper I do not myself propose to pay any attention to that criticism.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00337">Let me add that I hope the Joint Committee will be appointed as soon as possible. It is extremely desirable, not only that this vexed question should he settled, but that it should be settled before the Bills which are now before Parliament, and which may all be affected by the decision to which the Joint Committee would arrive, get through their various stages. There is the Birmingham Bill itself, out of which this proposal to set up the Joint Committee chiefly arose, and there are Bills for the extension of the borough of Reading and for the extension of Bath. The Bath Bill has already got in front of the other Bills in its passage through the House of Commons&#x2014;I believe it has practically passed through that House. Perhaps the noble Lord who is acting as Chairman of Committees will consider whether, when the time comes, it might not be desirable that the Birmingham Bill&#x2014;the principal Bill and the one on which the fight will really be fought&#x2014;should be taken in this House in front of the Bath Bill. I will not, however, go into that. question, which is not one for me to consider. I hope this Joint Committee will be appointed without. unnecessary delay, and that there wilt be an opportunity for them to fully discuss the matter and come to a decision with regard to the clauses which will have to be inserted in these Bills before the Bills reach their final stage, because the clauses to be inserted might reasonably affect the other clauses in the Bills. In the confident hope that the noble

Earl the Leader of the House will accept this Motion, as he did last year, I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00339"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need scarcely assure the House that I have no opposition whatever to offer to the Motion made by the noble Lord. On the contrary, I am glad that he has proceeded with it at so early a date in the session. The House will remember that in the early part of July last year we went with tolerable fullness into the whole of this vexed, difficult and complicated question, and it was agreed that the best chance of solving it was to he found in the appointment of a Joint Committee. That view was also accepted in another place, and the Joint Committee was authorised by both Houses. As regards the point raised by the noble Lord, or rather raised by other people against the noble Lord, in reference to the actual wording of the Motion, I confess it seems to me most unlikely, and indeed almost inconceivable, that the Joint Committee could take so narrow a view of their functions as to suppose that the term "financial adjustments" did not include the possibility of discussing and deciding on the question of compensation; and in the absence of any expressed opinion to the contrary I should not myself be disposed to advise the noble Lord to alter the wording of his Motion. I agree that for the reasons given by the noble Lord it is desirable that the Committee should be nominated as soon as possible, and I hope steps will be taken to that effect.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THOROUGHBRED STALLION SHOW.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00341"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member> rose to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether he would consider the alteration of the rule by which no exhibitor at the Show of Thoroughbred Stallions is allowed to enter more than one stallion in any class.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00342">The noble Lord said: My Lords, before putting this Question I should like to say that I realise that His Majesty's Government cannot alter the rule for this year, and that if a change is to be made it can only be made for the exhibition of horses a year hence. In putting the Question I am not in the least intending to cavil at the action of the Government, as this is the first time for many years that a British Government has taken any active step towards helping the important and very necessary industry of horse-breeding,. I recognise that in adopting this rule the Government are following one of the old rules of the Royal Commission on Horse-Breeding, but it seems to me to be a rule which has no sound basis in reason, and I want them to consider whether they cannot abolish it in future. For this rule I have never heard any serious argument advanced, except that without it people might make a business out of hunter stallions. But even if a business could be made out of them, it would he a very good thing. Hunter stallions are largely kept by country gentlemen, including many members of your Lordships' House, for the benefit of their own tenants and the farmers in their immediate neighbourhood. These gentlemen are doing an excellent public work, and why they should be told that this rule must continue for fear somebody may get two premiums I cannot imagine.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00343">After all, the object of this show of thoroughbred stallions is not that the Government may provide an interesting competition among stallion owners; the real object is that farmers and breeders may get hold of the very best horses available in the country, and if one man has two. three, or four of the best horses in England the rules ought to be so framed that that man should be encouraged. At present it is extremely difficult to keep in the country the class of horse that is most wanted. The agents of most of the European countries as well as the Japanese Government are spending large sums of money every year to secure our best horses. It is, therefore, very advisable that we should do every-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0064"/>
<col>77</col>
thing possible. to encourage the owners of the best. horses, and that can only be done by giving premiums to the best animals even if one man happens to possess two, three, or four stallions. This year you have another great advantage inasmuch as His Majesty has given a Champion Cup for this purpose. That will, perhaps, help as much as the additional grant given by the Government to keep good horses in the country, because owners will be induced to enter into competition in order to win the King's Cup as well as the grant. This will undoubtedly tend to encourage people to keep horses above the value for which they can reasonably expect to get a fair return; and it is, I contend, all in favour of the abolition of the rule. I hope the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will tell us that in another year the rule will be abolished.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00344"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene in this discussion mainly on the ground that from my youth upwards I have been a great lover of horses, while during the past twenty years I have had much experience in breeding stock. I have seen a letter sent cut by the Board of Agriculture to the various local authorities, and, as far as I can see, the proposals contained in it are of an able and practical kind. I am certain there will be only one desire in the country, and that is to assist the Board in this matter. I noticed two sentences in that letter. The first was that the President was anxious that the gentlemen appointed on the local committees should be intimately acquainted with the industry of horse-breeding; and the other, that it was all-important that the gentlemen appointed should possess practical experience and be closely identified with the industry. I cordially agree with those remarks and I would suggest that as these stallions are thoroughbred and of very great value, there should he at least one gentleman on each committee who has a thorough knowledge of thoroughbred stock and has studied the Stud Book. I am afraid the British public do not really understand the value of the animals embraced in the Stud Book, and are unaware very often that the Stud Book is quite different from the Herd Book. In the latter cattle can be entered after certain crosses have been obtained, but no animals can be entered in the Stud Book unless their origin can be traced to the original mares.<lb/>
<col>78</col>
When gentlemen are coming from all foreign countries to buy our best blood we ought to take care to preserve, as far as we can, the best character of thoroughbreds. I have had some experience of the damage sometimes done by the expenditure of money given by the Government with the best intentions for promoting the breeding of horses. Fifteen years ago I sat on a Commission appointed by a former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Cadogan, to inquire into Horse-breeding in Ireland, and we found that the Government had spent money on an animal known as the Hackney stallion, an animal of which I never approved. If that system of encouraging the Hackney stallion in the hunter-breeding districts had been continued, I believe that fine breed of hunters for which Ireland has always been remarkable would have very greatly deteriorated. There exists a magnificent breed of hunter brood mares got by thoroughbred stallions, and the produce of those animals, when mated with thoroughbred sires, used to fetch very large prices. If they had been mated wit h the perhaps rather taking Hackney stallion, the breed which has done so much good for the breeder in Ireland would have come to an end. Thus with the best intentions the Government might spend money on animals which were no good at all, and therefore they should be assisted by gentlemen with practical knowledge. I would urge on the noble Earl the absolute necessity of appointing on the committees gentlemen acquainted with the breeding and rearing of thoroughbred stallions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00345"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I may be permitted, before I answer the Question, to offer my best thanks to the noble Marquess for the generous words he has used in reference to the efforts of the Board to do something, at any rate, to promote the improved breeding of horses. The noble Marquess's words, which I hope will be well reported, will, no doubt, have great effect with the Advisory Council who have so kindly consented to help the Government. I understand the noble Marquess to mean that on the county committees gentlemen well acquainted with the breeding of racehorses should be appointed and that that should be left to the Lords Lieutenant who have kindly consented to form the committees. No doubt that suggestion will be warmly appreciated and acted upon.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00347"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The Duke of Richmond told me that he was taking a great interest in his county committee and that led me into the mistake. As regards the Question on the Paper, I can only remind my noble friend that the Government have only been five weeks in office, as it were, since their new departure, and, therefore, I hope he will excuse me for not having laid clown any very hard-and-fast rules on any subject yet. It is quite true that it is impossible to do anything this year, but the Advisory Council met yesterday under the presidency of Lord Middleton, when I know this question was discussed; and it will be gone into again most thoroughly. I do not like to give my own opinion on the subject, though I have one, as it is left entirely to the discretion of the Advisory Council; but I am not without hope that the wish expressed by my noble friend will before this day twelve months be practically carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE DECLARATION OF LONDON.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00389"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is clue to the House that I should give my reasons for withdrawing the Notice that is down in my name for to-morrow night with reference to the Declaration of London&#x2014;namely:
<quote>"To call attention to some of the reasons why the Declaration of London should not be ratified."</quote>
Since putting this Notice on the Paper I have been informed that a good deal of important correspondence is going on between the Foreign Office and the Associated Chambers of Commerce, and that both parties are agreed that it would be undesirable to have a discussion while this correspondence continued. I regret very much that the discussion of this subject is postponed. as I think there certainly ought to be a debate on it in this House before it is brought up in the other House. In the meantime I would suggest to His Majesty's Government that they might send the Declaration down to Portsmouth to be discussed by the officers going through the war course there, and that those officers should be asked their opinion as to the effect which the Declaration, if strictly carried out, would have on naval
<col>84</col>
strategy in the North Sea, and what could be done to prevent neutral ships, or ships disguised as neutrals, approaching our men-of-war provided the Declaration is strictly adhered to. I would also ask whether any noble Lord on the Government Bench can tell me when it is likely that the correspondence to which I have referred will come to an end, so that the subject may be brought before this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00390"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may say so, the noble Lord has acted wisely in suspending&#x2014;it is not more than that&#x2014;the Motion which was down on the Paper for to-morrow night. Your Lordships will probably remember that in the debate on the Address my noble friend the Leader of the House said that we proposed to defer consideration of the Declaration until after, or, at all events, during the tune of, the Conference, and we understood by a gesture by the noble Marquess opposite that he did not dissent from that intention. The noble Lord puts the issue too narrowly when he says that we are waiting for the correspondence with the Chambers of Commerce. A much wider set of considerations than that correspondence is affected and has to be taken in view. The noble Lord is mistaken in thinking that there could have been any discussion in another place. What the Government said in answer to questions in the House of Commons was that the matter was under discussion and consideration, and we could say nothing; and I am afraid that would have been the substance of my answer to the noble Lord to-morrow night if he had proceeded with the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00391"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount has referred to me, and I am anxious that there should be no misunderstanding as to our position in regard to this matter. I gathered from what I think was said by the noble Earl the Leader of the House that it was intended to bring up the Declaration of London for discussion at the Colonial Conference, and I may have made a gesture which seemed to signify approval of that proposal. But I certainly did not intend to convey the idea that, in my view, the reference of the Declaration of London to the Colonial Conference was in any way to preclude us from discussing the matter in this House
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0068"/>
<col>85</col>
should any Peer desire to bring it before your Lordships. I am under the impression, on the contrary, that the matter is likely to be brought up, and I cannot but think that the discussion will be extremely useful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00392"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: We may have misinterpreted the gesture of the noble Marquess. There is nothing at all unreasonable in the position he now takes up, and we shall be ready to meet the noble Marquess and his friends when the time comes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00393"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: I may say that 1 think it highly desirable that a discussion should take place in this House, so that the members of the Imperial Conference will be able to read that debate in <i>Hansard</i> before they come to conclusions themselves on arriving in this country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE WHITE SEA FISHERIES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00394"><member>LORD NUNBURNHOLME</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government what steps they proposed to take to protect British fishery interests in the waters of the Archangel district in view of the proposed Russian law to eliminate the three mile limit, extending the same to twelve miles.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00395">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in putting this Question I desire to say that do not wish to place any difficulties in the way of His Majesty's Government. As your Lordships are aware, there is a three mile limit round the coast of all European countries inside which no one is allowed to fish unless he belongs to that particular country. A certain Russian subject has lately purchased one or two old English trawlers and wishes to have the whole of the Archangel district of the White Sea put under the proposed Russian law for him to fish in. This is quite contrary to the present law, and I hope His Majesty's Government will not allow the existing three mile limit to be extended. It has been in existence for many years, and upon it are based many naval and commercial international rights. Only last week a leading Russian newspaper asserted that territorial limits were merely limited by the gun fire of shore batteries. Under that assumption the French Republic and the British Government might equally claim to control the Straits of Dover, and I am sure it would lead to endless international difficulties if our Foreign Office allowed to go through this proposal
<col>86</col>
extending the three mile limit to twelve miles. We do not stand alone in this matter; it affects other nations, but it affects this country perhaps more than any other, as the waters round our coast are comparatively shallow for a good way out whereas round the coasts of Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and Russia the waters become deep almost immediately, so that if they were allowed to extend the three mile limit to twelve miles it would practically preclude any foreigner from fishing in their fishing ground at all. Then there is another difficulty. It is very hard for any fisherman, or, indeed, any naval officer, to say, especially in hazy weather, whether or not a vessel is within the twelve mile limit, and there would be great probability of many squabbles in the Law Courts on this point. I hope His Majesty's Government will stand firm for international and British rights in this particular case. I beg to put the Question that stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00396"><member>*VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad my noble friend has not extended and amplified the various issues that might easily have been raised upon this point. I would only say this about the three mile limit. Those who arc well acquainted with the various views that have been taken by various nations of the sacro-sanctity of the three mile limit are aware that though the principle has always been firmly upheld by His Majesty's Government other Governments have occasionally put forward claims opposed to it. My noble friend said he hoped His Majesty's Government would stand firm in vindication of the rights and interests of British fishermen. I think there is no question whatever of the firm resolution of His Majesty's Government not to give way in that respect; and perhaps the shortest way of convincing your Lordships that that is so will be for me to state exactly what has happened.<lb/>
We have been informed by the noble Lord that the reason for the introduction of the Bill by the Russian Government is that they probably want to foster their own trawling industry, which is at present in its infancy. They also wish to prevent the continued destruction of what are called worse seal, and bear I am not enough of a naturalist to be able to define what those creatures are&#x2014;along the northern coast by Norwegian fishermen.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0069"/>
<col>87</col>
Last summer the Russian authorities arrested the British trawler "Onward Ho&#x0021;" off the north coast for illegal trawling outside the three mile limit&#x2014;they considered it illegal. In consequence of representations made by His Majesty's Government as to the capture having been made on the high seas, the Russian Government had to release the vessel, and His Majesty's Government have handed in a claim for compensation. It was probably this case that lead the Russian Government to take such steps as in their opinion would vindicate their position, and they accordingly introduced a Bill to regulate trawling on the northern coast without any further delay. British trawlers only fish for plaice, it appears, and we are assured by the secretary of the National Sea Fisheries Protection Association that they never have any reason for going within the three mile limit, except, of course when compelled by the state of the weather.<lb/>
For several years past His Majesty's Government have contributed to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which is studying the state and nature of the fisheries of the North Sea. This body have not yet completed their investigations, but the work they are at present engaged upon is explained on p. 141 of the North Sea Fisheries Blue Book [Cd. 5022]. As the House well knows from the many discussions on this subject which have taken place during the last ten or twelve years, it is not merely fishery interests that are concerned. There are, too, broad and very important national interests. In time of war those interests might be of the most serious kind, and before, therefore, we could agree to an international convention providing for the national control of fisheries and spawning grounds beyond the present three mile limit these investigations must be brought, if not to a close, to a further stage. My noble friend may be quite sure that we are protesting, and that we shall protest, if necessary, again. This very morning a telegram was received from the Ambassador at St. Petersburg giving the latest views of the Russian Government in reply to our protest. That telegram has, of course, not yet been considered, but my noble friend and your Lordships may feel quite assured that we are alive to all the considerations that are involved in this new departure, and that we shall
<col>88</col>
certainly defend every right and every interest., whether narrow or broad, which is involved in the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00398">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00399"><member>LORD FARQUHAR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I have the privilege for the third time of introducing to your Lordships' notice a Bill which proposes to amend the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884. I have on two previous occasions gone fully into the objects and details of this proposed change in the law relating to the conduct of elections. I must almost apologise for troubling your Lordships on this third occasion, but I am anxious to lose no time, so that the Bill may at last have a free passage in another place. This Bill has, as your Lordships are aware, already received the cordial support of the Lord Chancellor and of Lord James of Hereford. Its object, stated shortly, is to extend to municipal candidates the same protection against slanderous and mendacious statements at election times as that possessed by Parliamentary candidates under the provisions of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act of 1895. This Act provides an immediate remedy by summary proceedings against any person who circulates slanderous statements against a candidate at election times, often made just before the poll and when too late to be corrected. Your Lordships will doubtless have seen in a recent report of a case of the nature which would be affected by this Bill how tardy and ineffectual is the civil remedy. This Bill would act as a wholesome deterrent; it is not contentious, and it will, I feel sure, receive the general support and approval of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ASYLUMS OFFICERS SUPERANNUATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00460"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown had been taken on any question relating to the administration of the Asylums Officers Superannuation Act, 1909, and whether His Majesty's Government would make any statement on the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00461">The noble Lord said: My Lords, although I was in charge of this measure when it was before your Lordships' House it. 1909, I make no apology for asking His Majesty's
<col>94</col>
Government questions with regard to it, because we had very little assistance from the Government until the Bill reached the Third Reading. Questions of doubt have arisen, and I hope His Majesty's Government will be able to assist us with legal opinions upon them. The most important question is connected with Section 15, the section which allows an appeal to the Home Secretary. As your Lordships will remember, the right to a pension depends on having contributed during the period of service, and I he point arises whether there lies an appeal to the Home Secretary on the question of the right to contribute for pension. The point is, as I have said, an important one, and I trust that His Majesty's Government will be able to answer it satisfactorily. I the more hope that His Majesty's Government will answer it because in November, 1910, a question was addressed to Mr. Churchill in another place, in reply to which he said he was taking the opinion of the Law Officers op the point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00462">And out of that arises the second question. When the Home Secretary gives his decision as to whether or not a certain man is an established officer, will he decide also whether he is in Class 1 or Class 2? I know that the classification lies with the local authority, but I think it is important that in a question of this sort the Home Secretary should state whether the man is to be in Class 1 or Class 2. From that we get to the third question. Supposing a man in Class 2 appeals to be put in Class 1, is that a matter in which an appeal lies under Section 15? I believe those are all legal questions, and as I understand that the Law Officers of the Crown are considering the matter I hope we shall be given their opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00463">The matter is one of importance, because the issue has become more involved lately. Last March the Lunacy Commissioners invited a conference to consider questions connected with this Act. They invited the Medical Psychological Society, the asylum workers, the County Councils Association, and the representatives of Visiting Committees, but after the conference was held the Commissioners stated no opinion in writing in regard to their views, and different people said different things about what took place at that conference. The County Councils Association issued a circular to the local
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0073"/>
<col>95</col>
authorities in which they stated that Class I was to consist of the medical staff and the attendants and nurses directly engaged in care or charge, and that Class 2 was to consist of those whose duties were merely incidental to looking after patients. They represented that as the opinion of the Commissioners. That statement of the County Councils Association is disputed by the Medical Psychological Society, and the Home Secretary was asked in the other House last April whether any authoritative statement had been issued with regard to the administration of this Act. Mr. Churchill replied that no directions had been issued with the sanction of the Home Office. Therefore the statement of the County Councils Association need not he taken as official.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00464">There is a lack of uniformity at present in the way in which this Act is administered. The noble Earl the First Commissioner of Works comes from Worcestershire. That is a county which has distinguished itself from other counties in regard to the treatment it has accorded to a gardener. This gardener is in charge of patients under the rules of the asylum, but because he is not a medical attendant he has, I understand, been refused a pension. In the West Riding of Yorkshire, again, the chaplain has been excluded altogether from the benefit of the Act. It is a hard matter to expect these poor people to establish their claims, as I believe they can only do if the matter is left in complete doubt, by a suit in the Court of Chancery. This is much too expensive for them, and His Majesty's Government ought to come to their assistance by making a clear and concise statement with regard to these points.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00465">There is one other point that I would ask His Majesty's Government to clear up, rather in the interests of the local authorities. It relates to Section 12 of the Act, which states that pensions are to be paid out of the fund out of which the

salary or wages and emoluments are paid. In most cases that would be the maintenance fund of the asylum, but a case has arisen where a carpenter's salary is paid out of the building. fund, and con- building sequently his pension would be paid out of that fund, and would, therefore, be in a different category from the pensions of most other officers. The point is not a large one, but I have called attention to it as it may have come under the purview of the Law Officers of the Crown. I beg to put the Question standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00466"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown is being taken by the Home Office with reference to several questions which have arisen under the Asylums Officers Superannuation Act, 1909, in connection with appeals to the Secretary of State under Section 15 of the Act by officers and servants of certain asylums. The Law Officers are being asked to advise as to the extent of the Secretary of State's jurisdiction to determine disputes as to the right to superannuation allowance or as to the amount of such allowance, and generally as to the circumstances in which there is any appeal from the decision of a Visiting Committee under the Act. As soon as the opinion of the Law Officers is received the effect of it will be made known to Visiting Committees and others who may be concerned. I may add that the Local Government Board have already obtained from the Law Officers an opinion as to the proper construction to be placed on Section 12 of the Act, with reference to the fund out of which superannuation allowances and gratuities are to be paid, and the effect of this opinion is being communicated in a circular-letter&#x2014;a copy of which I will hand to the noble Lord&#x2014;to the Visiting Committees of asylums in England and Wales.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MOVABLE DWELLINGS BILL. [H.L]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00471" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00472">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00473"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have introduced this Bill this session in the form in which it left the Select Committee to which your Lordships referred it. The Bill came back from the Committee considerably altered one or two points. The whole question of registration was struck out by the Committee, although a careful perusal of the evidence will show that nearly every witness whose opinion was asked on the subject spoke in favour of registration, or in no way disapproved of the principle. I think, therefore, that I might be justified in saying that the Committee came to the conclusion adverse to registration more than anything from an objection on their part to the trouble and inconvenience always attendant upon every system of registration. Personally I have always attached considerable importance to registration, because the difficulty throughout has been not with regard to the powers which existed for coping with the evils so much as the difficulty of putting those powers in force on account of these dwellings being able to be moved constantly from place to place, and by that means to evade the ordinary rules which have been adopted for the regulation of dwellings of a more fixed nature. I think it would have been very useful in many
<col>98</col>
other ways, and for police regulation generally, that these movable dwellings should be registered and known, and that there should be some means of following them up. Your Lordships will remember that when this Bill was first introduced in your Lordships' House it contained much more than it did when it was last here, for it at first contained regulations with regard to the education of children in movable dwellings. Those provisions were, of course, dropped when the Children Act passed giving very large powers to local education authorities for enforcing the education of these children. In enforcing the law under the Children Act the local education authorities have found that it was more or less necessary for the ordinary working of the Act to make a list of movable dwellings which were habitually within their area, and I conceive that it would have very much facilitated the dealing with this question had some system of registration been introduced by which it might be clearly known to what persons the regulations wit h regard to movable dwellings applied, rather than leaving the matter vague and uncertain. But the question of registration has, as I have said, been set aside by the Select Committee to whom the consideration of the Bill was referred. I have, therefore, introduced the Bill this session in the form in which it recommended itself to the Committee, feeling sure that that was the feint in which your Lordships would give it the most favourable consideration.<lb/>
The provisions of the Bill as so amended are really confined to what was originally Clause 5 of the Bill, which gave power to the county council, or whichever was the registering authority in the area, to prohibit certain places as unfit for encampments, either on sanitary or health grounds, or because they were in other ways unsuitable. That principle, with a limitation, is the foundation of the Bill as it left the Select Committee. Clause 1 lays down that where it appears to any county council that the presence of movable dwellings on any specified place or places within the county would be dangerous to the public health, the council may by by-law prohibit any movable dwelling from being on such specified place or places. Clause 2 enables a county council to prohibit the encampment of a movable dwelling upon any common or roadside waste or upon any land in private occupation, provided the persons who proposed to encamp there had
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0075"/>
<col>99</col>
not the necessary permission; and the clause further gives power to the county council to prohibit camping even upon private ground where it appears that it would constitute a nuisance to the neighbourhood. Then there is this very important provision with regard to the exercise of these powers, that they must be under rules to be laid down by the county council and approved by the Local Government Board, and before the powers are made use of the county council must have already provided suitable camping grounds. Thus the effect of their restrictions will not be open to the objection that was urged against the original Bill&#x2014;that if put into force without any such provision as this it would have the effect, first, of driving dwellers in movable dwellings into counties where such restrictions did not exist, and, when those counties had in turn made similar protective provisions, of driving them, as the expression went, "off the face of the earth." This has, we hope, been prevented. I think it was the admitted view of the Select Committee that such provisions as are in the Bill would only be put in force in places where movable dwellings had become an aggravated nuisance and danger to the district, and would be left to lie dormant wherever it was found that the existence of the movable dweller was not an aggravated inconvenience to those who lived around him.<lb/>
I have in the course of my connection with this Bill received a large number of letters and appeals from admirers of the wild and free life of the gipsy, in favour of preserving his freedom. But I am afraid they overlook the fact that the habits of the gipsy are not altogether suited to the refined and elaborately regulated state of community life in which we live. No doubt we all of us, particularly, perhaps, when we are bothered with the variety of returns which we have to fill up and the inquisitions into all our private affairs, wish sometimes that we were left with the old freedom to do very much as we liked without the careful and parental supervision of Government; but I am afraid we must admit that in the highly-organised state of society in which we live such is impossible, and that the free and romantic life of the gipsy must be sacrificed somewhat to the well-being of the crowded community in which we live. I ask noble Lords to give the Bill a Second Reading, and I trust that if there are objections to any of its provisions they will
<col>100</col>
be allowed to stand over until the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00474">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clifford of Chudleigh</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00475"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading has reminded your Lordships of the Parliamentary history of this Bill, and has referred to some of the changes which were made by the Select Committee on which he sat. When the Bill was before your Lordships' House for Second Reading two years ago there was, I think, a general feeling that, if not a universal nuisance, still a distinct nuisance was caused in certain parts of the country by these movable dwellings which called for a remedy by legislation if one could be found, but your Lordships appreciated the fact that the Bill as then introduced was not quite so simple as it appeared to be at first sight, and consequently it was referred to a Select Committee. That Committee, as your Lordships are aware, gave a considerable amount of time to the Bill and endeavoured to meet the objections that were entertained to it, and in the course of doing so they to some extent transformed the Bill. Though the Committee may not have succeeded in meeting all the objections, they are to be thanked for their labours. For myself I can express appreciation of their work disinterestedly, because although originally appointed to serve on the Committee I was unable to attend owing to indisposition and absence abroad.<lb/>
I can say at once that it is the view of the Local Government Board, which Department I represent in your Lordships' House, that the labours of the Select Committee should not be thrown away, and that the Bill should be amended in Committee with the view to making it a more workable measure than it would seem to be at present. Besides the Department which I represent, the Home Office would have something to do with the administration of this Bill if it became an Act. They, I believe, foresee some greater difficulties in the administration of the measure than do the Local Government Board; but my noble friend Lord Beauchamp, who represents the Home Office, is here to deal with the objections from their point of view and that of the police. I am glad that the registration proposals which appeared in the former Bill have been abandoned. That was a very much
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0076"/>
<col>101</col>
more difficult matter than appeared at first sight. The principle of registration seemed easy enough, but when it came to putting it into practice and to registering every little tent, and perhaps a tarpaulin on two or three sticks, it would have been found quite unworkable. Other objections were stated by the Committee in their Report, and I think there will be a general feeling of satisfaction that the principle of registration has been abandoned.<lb/>
The Bill as amended embraces three chief purposes. There is, first, the prohibition of encampments on specified places on the ground of public health; secondly, the provision of camping grounds by county and county borough councils, with certain provisions ancillary to that; and, thirdly, the transfer from district councils to county councils of the powers and duties under Section 9 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885. With regard to the prohibition of encampments, Clause 1 of the Bill in its present form will enable a county or county borough council to prohibit by by-law any movable dwelling from being on any specified place where its presence might be dangerous to the public health. In regard to that, I may say that it appears somewhat doubtful whether prohibition by by-law is a suitable procedure. A resolution oft lie county or county borough council, approved by the Central Department and published by means of notices throughout, the area, would, I think, be a more appropriate procedure. As to the provision of camping grounds, Clause 2 of the Bill would enable county and county borough councils, with the approval of the Local Government Board and by agreement, to purchase or take on lease land. for camping grounds. I have no wish to raise any difficulties in that matter, which would be one for the county councils or whatever authority the power is given to in the various counties; but as the object of the Bill seems to be to some extent to restrict the use of grounds, I think that in the counties where legislation on these lines is desired it may be found somewhat difficult to acquire land, and though some landowners may be willing to sell or let land for the purpose yet their neighbours would very likely find considerable grievance in the encampment of gipsies close to their dwellings. But that, as I say, is a matter for the county or county borough councils concerned.<lb/>
It will have been noticed that in their
<col>102</col>
Report the Committee express the opinion that no legislation is called for with respect to showmen, or entertainers as they are called, and I think some provision might be made for eliminating this class altogether from the Bill. It may be rather difficult to draw a strict definition of what is meant by "showman" or "entertainer," but if no legislation is to be better that they should be eliminated altogether from the provisions of the Bill. As to the encampments, it is places should be subject to approval by some central authority, probably the Local Government Board, otherwise a council might use the power to exclude gipisies from their area altogether. These are several of the directions amongst others in which the Bill might be usefully amended. It seems to me that Clause 3 is quite unnecessary and should be omitted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00478"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The point of Clause 3 is that it transfers the powers to the country councils.

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00479"><sup>*</sup><member> LORD ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: That is a matter which can be dealt with when the Bill is in Committee, but the view is strongly held that the clause is unnecessary. As the noble Marquess has said, Clause 3 would transfer to country councils the powers and duties of sanitary authorities under the enactment so far as they relate to movable dwellings. As to cost, considerable expense would no doubt be incurred in regard to requisitions for obtaining camping grounds. This is a point which probably the Committee did not fully appreciate. Still, if the ratepayers in a district demand legislation of the character proposed in this Bill and are willing to have a charge placed upon them for the purpose, it is, of course, their affair. The Local Government Board and His Majesty's Government are very anxious that the labours of the Select Committee should not be thrown away, and therefore I join in hoping that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<col>103</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00480"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISEURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say first, on behalf of the Select Committee of which I w s a member, that we are very grateful to the noble Lord who has just sat down for the kind way in which he has received the result of our efforts, and for the promise which he has given on behalf of His Majesty's Government that they will not in any way interfere with the Second Reading of the Bill. The noble Lord, in the course of his speech, went into a good deal of detail, of w rich I do not in any way complain, but he will forgive me if I do not follow him into that detail because some of the matters with which he dealt are more appropriate to the Committee stage.<lb/>
I should like to call attention to one or two points which emerge from the Report of the Select Committee, a id which, I think, arc of public interest. The Report, in the first place, will help t he public to realise what the dimensions of the problem really are. There was a vague, idea that it was a vast and grievous problem which had to be dealt with. Speaking for myself, I carried away from the evidence which we heard the conviction that that was an error, and that the grievance is not of a very large character. The areas to which the grievance applies are relatively small and rare. That is the first consideration. The second is that the mischief which those who live in movable dwellings are accused of doing has been greatly exaggerated. This erroneous view of the public is largely due to the fact that the gipsy van-dwellers have been confused with ordinary tramps. That is not surprising. Where, in districts where there are both, an unwashed person of a violent character intimidates somebody or other the victim does not accurately distinguish whether the aggressor is a tramp or a gipsy, and probably does not know the distinction between the two.<lb/>
It is important for the public to realise that, so far as major crime is concerned, gipsies came very well out of the inquiry. As far as we could make out, they are not any more criminal&#x2014;in any extreme sense of the term&#x2014;than persons of a corresponding class who live in ordinary houses. No doubt they belong to a low class and are not strictly orderly- in their behaviour, and there is a good deal of petty pilfering and taking of rabbits which do not belong to them; but, taken in the bulk, and considering crime of an important kind, we
<col>104</col>
had very strong evidence before us that they were not responsible for it. Nor can it be said that they are more immoral or dirty than other people as poor as themselves in this country. It is very important, I think, that that should be realised, and that we should recognise that no amount of legislation with respect to movable dwellings will reach the most extreme form of the evil which is associated with the tramp and vagrancy, and which urgently requires attention as soon as His Majesty's Government have finished meddling with the Constitution.<lb/>
The next point is this, that the actual condition of the law is not deficient. The difficulty is in its enforcement. Take the sanitary law, for example. The sanitary law extends to movable dwellings, but the difficulty is to apply it, and it was with a view of a more general application of the sanitary law that the Select Committee proposed to transfer the authority from district councils to the county councils, because as a movable dwelling is <i>exhypothesi</i> moved from one district to another it ought to be under the jurisdiction of the larger authority. The criminal law, too, applies to movable dwellings, but there is a difficulty in enforcing it in the case of small crimes such as cutting sticks out of hedges, leaving the gates of fields open whereby cattle stray on the public roads, and mild poaching in the sense that they poach not to sell but to eat. There is a great deal of difficulty in enforcing the law in regard to these offences, for the police cannot be ubiquitous and keep in touch with the vans. It was for that reason that the Committee made the important proposal which is inserted in the Bill. If you cannot keep the police in touch with the van-dwellers by putting a policeman wherever there is a camp, then the better method is to limit the places where there can be camps so that the police can exercise adequate supervision. It was with that object that Mr. Justice Bray suggested that, in the few areas where the gipsy difficulty is an important one, the proper remedy was to set aside certain places in which gipsies could camp and where they would be conveniently under the supervision of the authorities. We did our best to put Mr. Justice Bray's proposal in drafting form, and it appears in the clauses in the Bill.<lb/>
I ought, perhaps, to notice what Lord Clifford said on the subject of registration.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0078"/>
<col>105</col>
May I interject the observation that I think your Lordships have every reason to be grateful to my noble friend for the trouble he has taken in connection with this Bill, both for having brought it before the House and for the exceedingly conciliatory way in which he allowed us to deal with it in the Select Committee. The Committee were not agreed on the question of registration. Although my noble friend was, in fact, overruled, he was overruled by a small majority, and it is clear, after the statement of the noble Lord who spoke last, that His Majesty's Government agree with the majority of the Committee. Therefore it is pretty certain that the original provision with regard to registration will not be reinserted. I may say I still doubt the value of the registration proposal, and thought, as the noble Lord said, most of the witnesses were in favour of it, there is some limitation to be added to that general statement. For instance, Mr. Justice Bray was not in favour of registering vans, but he was in favour of registering the individuals who live in the vans&#x2014;a very different proposal. I do not think there was any great enthusiasm for registration on the part of the official witnesses, and that is confirmed by the speech of the noble Lord who spoke on behalf of the Local Government Board.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Allendale, asked us why we deal with showmen if it is our opinion that showmen ought not to be included in this legislation. We intended in the Amendments which we inserted in the Bill to exclude showmen. That was the object which the Committee had in view, but there was this difficulty, that there is no definition in law of a showman. We turned all sorts of authorities on to search for a definition, but could not find one. Therefore we did not like, in so many words, to say that the Act should not apply to showmen, because we thought that afterwards the great profession over which the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack presides would make mincemeat of our Act of Parliament. Consequently we adopted the only other device open to us, and made clear our intention of leaving to the authority whose business it would be to enforce the law discretionary power to interpret our wish according to the spirit in which it was made. The Local Government Board are not to agree to any regulations which interfere with showmen. That was, in effect, tine method by which we tried
<col>106</col>
to get round the difficulty. I see that the Lord Chancellor thinks that our amateur efforts were not worthy of very much respect. No doubt when we get into Committee the noble and learned Lord will be able to show us how it ought to be done, and we shall gladly accept his advice. I speak on behalf of the whole Committee. We are entirely in the hands of the Departments in this matter. We have no wish to enforce upon them legislation which they tell us is unworkable, and we are in the position of accepting anything which the Government suggest by way of amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00481"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the noble Marquess who has just sat down recognises how much the police authorities of this country are interested in the subject before your Lordships. I therefore venture to intrude upon the House for a few moments in order to say something upon this Bill from the point of view of the Home Office. If Lord Camperdown will allow me, I should like on this occasion to drop a tear over the disappearance of the Standing Committee. It seems to me that a Bill of this kind, when everybody is agreed that something should be done and the difficulty is really one of administration, is a measure which might have been discussed by a Committee of that kind somewhat more easily perhaps than can be done in your Lordships' House. The Bill which is now before us is based, as the noble Marquess has said, very largely on the recommendations of the Select Committee. In that way it differs from the Bill first introduced into your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I should like, in order to make the position of the Home Office quite clear, to quote some of the evidence which was given before the Select Committee. The view of the Home Office is that what is needed is a more effective enforcement of the existing law in cases where gipsies are guilty of offences. I would refer your Lordships to the evidence given to the Select Committee by Mr. Pedder, a Principal Clerk in the Home Office. In reply to a question [p. 49, Q. 1029] Mr. Pedder said&#x2014;
<quote>"I think our information does go to show that it is a failure to enforce which is at all events largely responsible for failure of effect, for this reason&#x2014;that for many years complaints have come to us from different counties, mostly the Home Counties, that new powers were wanted, and so on and so on. When inquiry has been made, when the Home Secretary has written back to say, 'Please
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0079"/>
<col>107</col>
direct your attention to these powers and tell me what you have done with them,' the answer Las been extremely vague, and sometimes none at all, and the matter has dropped."</quote>
Clause 5 of the last Bill tried to deal with the matter by giving local authorities practically an unrestricted power to prohibit movable dwellings by by-law. That is not found in the present Bill. Clause 2 of this Bill endeavours to deal with the matter in a different way, and, in the opinion of the Home Office, it is open to some objections, though necessarily not the same objections.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00482"><member>THE MARQUESS OF. SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Although Clause 5 of the original Bill does not reappear, a great deal of it does. Clause 1 is, in its essence, a large part of Clause. 5.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00483"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I agree; but I was only dealing with it in so far as the police are concerned. It is Clause 2 of this year's Bill with which the Home Office are more particularly concerned. Your Lordships will notice, in the first place, that the noble Lord below the Gangway (Lord Clifford of Chudleigh), who speaks, I think, on this occasion on behalf of the County Councils Association, proposes to add to the powers of county councils various powers which will enable them to spend more money out of the rates, because by the first part of the clause county councils are allowed to purchase or take on lease land for the purpose of camping grounds. But it is not so much the addition to the rates with which I am concerned, but the effect which the provision must have upon the police. The proposal in the latter part of Clause 2 places on the police the duty of removing from commons and private land persons who encamp there without authority. That, in our opinion, involves a wide and rather questionable extension of the functions of the police. At present it rests upon private owners to remove trespassers; and the duty of the police is confined to seeing that there is no breach of the peace. The Home Office think it undesirable to make an exception from the ordinary law of trespass in respect of one particular class&#x2014;namely, van-dwellers&#x2014;and to subject that class alone to prosecution for trespass.<lb/>
The effect of Clause 2, it is thought, might in certain cases lead to considerable difficulty. If the facilities for camping are reduced the feuds and fighting between gipsy families, which are already not uncommon, are likely to be more numerous, as
<col>108</col>
hostile gipsies would then find themselves compulsorily encamped side by side. The Chief Constable of Surrey takes the view that the policing of camping grounds would he necessary, and he says lie is not able to undertake that duty with the present staff under his command. So your Lordships will see that in that wav a still further burden might be thrown on the rates. It would be a question whether the county council should not appoint a special staff of men for this purpose. At any rate, a special staff would be necessary to collect the fees referred to in Clause 2 (3) (<i>d</i>). Then we find some difficulty with regard to another matter. The policeman or other officer finding more than the prescribed number of movable dwellings upon a particular ground would often be unable to discover who was the last coiner responsible for the excess, and, even if he were discovered, it might be that his horse was in a condition which would not enable him to get further. Again, it is not clear whether the provision in Clause 2 (3) (b) is intended to enable councils to authorise certain gipsies to encamp in certain places, or whether it is only intended for holiday makers in caravans. The provision is unsuitable to gipsies who would find it hard to understand such regulations and would not know where to apply for the written permission. As your Lordships will have seen, there is no matter of principle on which I have had to criticise the measure, and perhaps, with the assistance of private negotiations before the Committee stage, we shall be able to put down Amendments which will be agreeable to all parties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00484"><member>LORD FARRER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have risen to address your Lordships were it not for the fact that the noble Marquess opposite seemed to make more light of the difficulties with regard to van-dwellers than we who live in the Home Counties think is the case. As a member of the Select Committee who considered this matter, I certainly came to the conclusion that these people were increasing largely, and were a great danger to the health and the safety of the public. Even this short debate has shown the extreme difficulty of dealing with the question at all, but as a resident in the Home Counties I must say that the evil has reached a pitch which really demands that some action should be taken on the part of the administrative authorities. I seldom take up a local paper without finding some reference to this subject. In a report,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0080"/>
<col>109</col>
in a Surrey paper last week, of a meeting of the Reigate Rural Council I read that
<quote>"Mr. B. W. Parsons, in accordance with notice of motion, moved that the Surrey Standing Joint Committee should be again urged to make arrangements at once for a police constable to be domiciled at Irons bottom, as the nearest constables were at Henley (3&#x00BD; miles distant), Salfords (4 miles), and Reigate (4 miles), and continued complaints were made as to the insolence of gipsies and the destruction of property, and annoyance caused by the nuisance Of filth and by dirty clothes exposed on the hedges of the highways. The mover said that at the present time there were fourteen vans by the side of the road, and in each there were 110 fewer than four or live people. There were absolutely no sanitary arrangements. People were in the habit of giving gipsies water, and if they were unable to get it they would not stop in the place. He did not know whether the water company could help them, as people had no right to give the company's water away, Gipsy people were like beggars, they were always on the "cadge." He thought it was very hard that if a poor man in the borough were to beg he would get a month, but yet these people were free, because there was no policeman to look after them.&#x2014;Mr. Garland said that in the district in which he lived they never saw a policeman.&#x2014;Mr. Hallett said it was certainly a matter of urgency, and if their request was not acceded to, lie would suggest a deputation being sent to the county council. They had to pay a heavy police rate and they wanted protection for their property.&#x2014;The Chairman said he entirely sympathised with what the speakers had said. A nuisance of an unspeakable character undoubtedly existed. He would he only too glad if the resolution was also sent to the Home Secretary.&#x2014;The proposition was carried."</quote>
Then, again, at an inquest held at Kingston on the eighteen-months-old son of wandering parents it was shown that the child had been badly burnt in the kitchen of a lodging-house; but, in spite of medical advice, the parents dragged the child about with them until it ultimately died from the effects of the burns and exposure. At the inquest Inspector Parry, of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, said the father kept a diary of the places visited, which showed that since last October they had stayed in forty-one different towns in all parts of the country. The Coroner, Dr. M. H. Taylor, said that&#x2014;
<quote>"If anybody wanted to move a pig from Surrey into Middlesex, he would find all kinds of restrictions placed upon him. Yet people like these could go anywhere and take with them a sick child needing the most careful treatment, and nobody interfered.

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00485"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to detain the House, but I desire to thank your Lordships for the reception you have given to this Bill. I have no doubt that many improvements in it will be able to be made in Committee, and I hope that, with the assistance of the Local Government Board and the Home Office, the Bill may be brought into a form in which it will prove of great use. I should like to say a word regarding Clause 3. The whole purport of that clause lies very much in the evidence of Mr. Pedder, which has been quoted by the noble Earl. It was clearly shown, in the course of the evidence which the Committee took, that it is not so much powers that are wanted as the getting of some body who can and will use the existing powers. For instance, Mr. Pedder said that there were about 1,800 authorities who might have made by-laws but only 216 had made them, and that the best use had not been made of the by-laws even in those 216 cases. Therefore there is something wrong in the distribution of the powers. We came to the conclusion that for these wandering and movable people the area of the sanitary authority is too small, arid that the powers should be confided to larger authorities. As regards the noble Earl's statement that I am endeavouring to increase the charge on the county rate, I can only say that this is a permissive power. What county councils complain of chiefly is the increase in the rates caused by matters in regard to which they have no option. If every increase in the county rate was entirely on the initiative of the county council, as this would be, they would have comparatively little cause for complaint. With regard to the police, I admit that in some cases the Bill might increase their work, but we had evidence to show that if the system of camping grounds was adopted the labour cast on the police would be very much decreased, inasmuch as they would know exactly where to find the people whom they would have to look after. As to the further stages of the Bill, I will not put it down for Committee until I have consulted with the noble Earl. I agree that a great deal may be done by private consultation with the Local Government Board and the Home Office, and 1 hope that when the Committee stage is taken there will be a set of Amendments which will render the Bill a more workable measure than it is at the present moment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ARMY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00487"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call attention to&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. The numbers of the Regular Army and Regular Reserve.</li>
<li>2. The numbers required to complete the Expeditionary Force of six Divisions.</li>
<li>3. The number of troops left in the United Kingdom in event of the departure of the Expeditionary Force on foreign service.</li></ol>
I am not surprised that at present the prevailing opinion is that our military forces are fully adequate for the requirements of home and Imperial defence. That impression has been produced upon public opinion by the Government constantly and continuously assuring us that we possess armies on a scale quite unprecedented in our history. For instance, the Secretary of State for War told us in 1908 that so far from having reduced the Regular Army he had added 90,000 men to its strength. In January, 1909, when addressing his East Lothian constituents, he told us that&#x2014;
<quote>"He could now mobilise four Divisions of the Expeditionary Force by touching a button, and he had the weapons, stores, and men to mobilise all six Divisions and have a surplus over."</quote>
In explaining the Army Estimates in 1909 the right hon. gentleman promised us a Regular Reserve of 200,000 men. In October, 1910, at the Cutlers' Feast at Sheffield, he announced that the Expeditionary Force would mobilise at about 180,000 men, and on the same occasion the right hon. gentleman added&#x2014;
<quote>"What we get at home is a Force that would compel the enemy to come in such large numbers that the Fleet would either destroy them, or, if they come in small numbers, our Territorial Force and a very considerable number of Regular troops, Which in any event we should have at home, would be able to fall upon them and crush them by their weight."</quote>
Finally, in December last at Grimsby we were informed that we had 580,000 troops organised in twenty Divisions of ten Army Corps.<lb/>
It is interesting to compare the numbers of officers and men shown as available for national defence by War Office Returns and Army Estimates with the figures mentioned by the Secretary of State for War in the speeches to which I have referred. It is necessary to remember that the policy of reducing the Regular Army initiated by the Government in 1906 will not be fully
<col>112</col>
realised until 1913. Consequently all calculations regarding the numbers of the Regular Army must be based on the strength of the Regular Reserve, not as it now is when a diminishing quantity, but as it will be in 1913 when the reductions have touched bottom. We were assured in 1908 that 90,000 men had been added to the strength of the Regular Army. If that had been the ease these men would have passed in due course from the Colours into the Regular Reserve, and would have remained available in the first class Army Reserve till 1920. War Office Returns, such as the Army Annual Return, 1906, and the Army Estimates of 1910-1911, and the Army Reserve Return of March 31, 1909, show that the Regular Army, with the Regular Reserve and the Militia, if it had remained at its strength as in 1905, would have been 87,626 men stronger than the Regular Army and the Regular and Special Reserves will be in 1913. The addition of 90,000 men in 1908, therefore, results not in an increase in numbers in 1913 but in a diminution of 87,626 men. We ought to have 90,000 more men available, according to the Secretary of State for War; but according to War Office Returns we shall have nearly 90,000 men less&#x2014;a difference of some 180,000 men.<lb/>
I next take the case of the Regular Reserve of 200,000 men, which was promised to us by the Secretary of State for War when introducing the Army Estimates for 1909. This Reserve in 1913 will be made up of the three following groups: Of the first class Army Reserve, with a strength of 106,372, as estimated by Lord Erroll's Return; of Section D of the Regular Reserve, hitherto known as the second class Army Reserve, with a strength estimated by the Under-Secretary of State for War at 24,985; and of the Special Reserve, with an establishment of 70,000 non-commissioned officers and men. These three separate groups, when added together, will give a gross total of 201,537. But this number of Regular Reservists can only be obtained by assuming that the Special Reserve will always be up to its full establishment of 70,000 men, which it is not now and never yet has been. It is also necessary to ignore the fact that the Special Reserve depends for its existence on the enlistment of boys of 17, and that War Office Returns show that one-third of our Special Reservists&#x2014;that is, 20,000&#x2014;must always be boys of under 20, and not available for foreign service. Let me give
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0082"/>
<col>113</col>
your Lordships an instance as to the age of these promised Regular Reservists. Last week at the West London Police Court a deserter from a Special Reserve battalion was brought up. His age proved to be 15 years and 9 months. The magistrate said&#x2014;
<quote>"This is a more child dressed up as a soldier. As ho is tot16 years old I cannot deal with him. He must go to the Children's Court at Westminster."</quote>
But that child on mobilisation is counted&#x2014;this is an absolute fact&#x2014;as a Reserve soldier of the Regular Army&#x0021;<lb/>
As regards Section D, hitherto known as the second class Army Reserve, this section of the Reserve is composed of those men who, on completion of twelve years of Colour and Reserve service, can be persuaded to re-enlist for a further period of four years. The number of 24,985, the estimated strength for 1013, must be pure guess-work, because the re-enlistment is voluntary. The men may re-enlist or they may not, according to the circumstances of the moment. Last July the Under-Secretary of State for War hoped to get from 15,000 to 20,000 of these men by 1913. Now the noble Lord reckons on almost 25,000. It is the abnormal outflow from the great Reserve created by the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, which alone justifies any such expectation. When that extraordinary outflow ceases, then Section I) must dwindle, because there will be far fewer time-expired Reservists eligible for re-enlistment. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War has told us that the men in Section of the Army Reserve will be required for instant, service with the Expeditionary Force. I should like to ask the noble Lord if he can tell us any good reasons for considering these men fit for this duty, because I can quote excellent reasons to prove the contrary. To do so, I must refer to the evidence given by General Sir T. Kelly-Kenny and Lord Methuen as to the value of Section D men during the South African war. The evidence is lengthy, but my excuse for quoting it is that it bears upon a point of extreme importance&#x2014;namely, the adequacy or the inadequacy of the Regular Reserve provided by the Government for the requirements of the Expeditionary Force. If the Regular Reserve is wholly insufficient to complete the Expeditionary Force, then that Force becomes impossible, and the whole military edifice of the Government collapses
<col>114</col>
and must be reconstructed from the foundation.<lb/>
The question, then, is, Would these 25,000 men&#x2014;whom, by the way, you have not yet got, but in the event of your getting them&#x2014;would they be fit to go on service with the Expeditionary Force? The evidence which I ask your Lordships to allow me to read supplies the answer. The following questions were put to Sir P. Kelly-Kenny by Sir G. Taubman Goldic&#x2014;
<quote>Q.&#x2014;Did you see much distinction in quality between Reservists and the men who had been serving up to date?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;I think there was a distinction in the older Reservists, the Section D, but in the case of the others who had not left the ranks long I did not see very much.</quote>
<quote>Q.&#x2014;You did not bear of any difficulties as regards discipline?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;I did with regard to Section D&#x2014;in fact, I experienced them myself; when they came up they grumbled a great deal.</quote>
<quote>Q.&#x2014;Dut the other sections were quite up to the mark of the soldiers who were in the ranks before?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;I think so.</quote>
<quote>Q.&#x2014;They bad not lost their military habits.</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;No, they had not; I could not trace anything against the Reservists I had.</quote>
<quote>Q.&#x2014;Except Section D?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;That is so.</quote>
Then I come to the evidence given by General Lord Methuen. He was asked by the Chairman (Lord Elgin) as to the marching, and Lord Methuen replied&#x2014;
<quote>"As soon as the weak men were weeded oat and the troops were in condition there was no question as to the men marching well. I cannot ever recollect the men not being ready to do more than I asked them to perform. I gladly include the Militia and the Volunteer companies in this statement. As long as the men are well fed and taken care of by their officers one need not fear stragglers. I except, as a rule, the men of Section D from the above remarks, as they fell out, and we left a good many behind at different places."</quote>
Lord Methuen was further questioned as follows&#x2014;
<quote>Q.&#x2014;What does that mean with regard to Section D?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;They are men having special qualifications. I was going to say they are more or less veterans who go into Section D.</quote>
<quote>Q.&#x2014;And he [a Section D man] is a man who has gone through the Reserve and is allowed to conic back?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;-Yes, and only for special reasons ho is allowed to go on.</quote>
<quote>Q.&#x2014;He may have fallen out because he was physically unfit?</quote>
<quote>A.&#x2014;That is so, I think, because he was more or less a cripple.</quote>
Lord Methuen is more than satisfied with the marching and willingness of the men in
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0083"/>
<col>115</col>
the Regular Army, the Militia, and the Volunteers, but he specially excepts the men in Section D of the Regular Reserve. Sir T. Kelly-Kenny also emphatically puts Section D men in a class by themselves. The fact is that men in Section D&#x2014;that is, the second class Army Reserve&#x2014;have been far too long away from the Colours. They must have been nine years, and may have been thirteen years, absent from the Colours. Now a Cavalry soldier, who has not been on a horse for twelve years and weighs several stone heavier than when he left the Regiment, would be what is termed a "little out of practice" when he first starts riding, and that in the presence of the enemy. Your Lordships may rest assured that there is no Commanding Officer in the Regular Army who would not far rather take his Regiment on instant active service without Section D men in the ranks than with them.<lb/>
Last November the noble Lord told us that&#x2014;
<quote>"Section Section D is not the second class of the Army Reserve; it is now always classed in the first class of the Army Reserve."</quote>
It is always open to the Secretary of State for War to call black white and white black, and the Army Council must agree with him, but that is the only plan on which the second class Army Reserve can he converted into the same value as the first class Reserve. It is a case of mixing up the second class with the first class and calling the blend first class. As regards the service strength of Section D, the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War allows on the mobilisation of the second class Army Reserve the same ten per cent. rate for wastage as he does for serving soldiers. Men with the Colours live under the eye of the surgeon, under the very best of sanitary surroundings. Men in Section D are some twenty years older than the men with the Colours and have had to shift. for themselves for many a long year without food, clothing, and medical attendance provided by the State. Moreover they have often been engaged for years in work and trades which impair both eyesight and hearing. I accept the ten per cent rate, because I am calculating strictly on <i>War Office data</i>, but at the same time I cannot refrain from pointing out that it is clearly contrary to all common sense to allow the same rate for unfitness with men of the second class Army Reserve as for men serving with the Colours.<lb/>
<col>116</col>
To sum up our promised Regular Reserve of 200,000 men. First you begin by reducing the Regular Reserve from 137,000 to 106,372&#x2014;a reduction of 30,628 noncommissioned officers and men. Then you suppose that all Special Reservists are of the same value as Regular Reservists, and that you have got 70,000 men in the Special Reserve, although you have not got that number. Next you assume that 20,000 boys in the Special Reserve are old enough for instant foreign service, although they are not. Finally you reckon that 24,985 men, whom you have not yet got, in the second class Army Reserve&#x2014;that is Section D&#x2014;are fit for active service abroad, although the experience of the South African war has proved that they are not.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00489"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: You assume it because you promised a Regular Reserve of 200,000 men. I am suggesting to the noble Lord how he gets them. The noble Lord will admit that the Government promised a Reserve of 200,000 men?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00491"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I next come to the numbers required to form the Expeditionary Force, which, according to the Secretary of State for War, is to mobilise at about 180,000 men and have a surplus over. By the War Office Table of April 8, 1907, and by War Establishments, 19091910, the total strength of officers and men, including two Mounted Brigades since added, is 171,095. The Secretary of State, in his speech at Sheffield, mentioned 180,000 men, but that figure includes the Special Contingent, which ought to number 15,173 men. Last November the noble Lord informed us that the deficiency in the Special Contingent amounted to 6,622. I take the numbers of the Army of 1909 as given in the Army Annual Return dated 1910 as a standard of comparison, because that is the last complete Return now available. I refer to Table 1 of the Army Memorandum of 1907, which gives the composition of the Expeditionary Force, and to answers given by the Under-Secretary of State for War last November. I find Section A and B of the Regular Reserve&#x2014;that is, the body of men hitherto known to us as the first class Army Reserve&#x2014;would
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0084"/>
<col>117</col>
in 1913 be 15,637 men deficient of the requirements of the Expeditionary Force. But assuming that mobilisation takes place in or after the month of May&#x2014;that is, after all foreign drafts have gone abroad&#x2014;then, by the answers of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War last November, an additional 13,603 men over twenty years of age would be required from the Regular Reserve to complete the numbers of the Expeditionary Force. This makes a total deficit of 29,240 men in the first class of the Regular Reserve for the requirements of the Expeditionary Force. The deficiency of 29,240 men is met to a limited extent on paper, but cannot be overcome in any way in the field, by the 22,100 men, the estimated strength of Section D less ten per cent. allowed for casualties. The result, then, is that all sections of the Regular Reserve, including 22,400 men of Section D, will not suffice for the requirements of the Expeditionary Force after the drafts have gone abroad by 6,834 men.<lb/>
In this connection I would venture to remind the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State of his statement on July 7 last year, when he said&#x2014;
<quote>"In 1913, when the Regular Reserve will be at its lowest, we shall require no Special Reservists to bring the Regular battalions up to the full war establishment. We shall only require them subsequently for drafts and a successive series of drafts so that there will be time to mature."</quote>
I hope the noble Lord will disclose to us the source front which he draws these Regular Reservists upon whom he relies with such confidence to more than complete the Expeditionary Force, because the Returns supplied to Parliament show, not a surplus, but a deficit of nearly 30,000 men in the first class Army Reserve, and of nearly 7,000 if Section D men are added. But common sense tells us that men who have left the Colours for twelve or thirteen years must be quite unfit to take their places in the ranks, some serving as non-commissioned officers, in the First Line and go into action within a few weeks of mobilisation. Now this deficit must be met by the Special Reserve and by the men in the Territorial Army who have agreed to serve abroad on mobilisation. I assume that the whole six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force are to go abroad made up to a strength of 180,000 men, and will leave a surplus over.</membercontribution></p>
<col>118</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00492"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Duke again, but would he mind telling me what figures he takes when he makes that calculation as to the number of serving Regulars available on mobilisation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00493"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: They will be found in War Office Table of April 8, 1907. Now for the surplus. First of all, it is recognised that if the Expeditionary Force is to be of full value in a great emergency it must proceed abroad as a whole within two or three weeks of the outbreak of war. It is obviously essential that the whole weight of the striking force must be thrown into the scale of battle at one moment, or the opportunity will be irretrievably missed. To dribble the Expeditionary Force abroad by slow degrees because you want it for home defence is to ensure the defeat of the Expeditionary Force in detail overseas. Besides, to retain the striking force for home defence is a breakdown of all our military machinery and a confession of inability to take the offensive overseas. The Secretary of State for War has informed us that we have 580,000 men organised in twenty Divisions of ten Army Corps. Six Divisions go abroad. How many would be left at home? This simple sum worked out by War Office figures gives the following answer. On the departure of the Expeditionary Force we shall be left with seven Regular Infantry battalions, three regiments of Cavalry, and some 15,000 men of the Royal and of the Special Reserve Artillery. These numbers are easily obtained by subtracting the number of battalions and regiments tabled to go abroad with the Expeditionary Force from the total number serving in the United Kingdom, as shown by the Army Annual Return. In the same way it is easy to calculate the number of Regular Infantry officers available for duty at home by subtracting the total tabled to go abroad with the Expeditionary Force from the total serving at home, as shown by the January Army List. It is, of course, necessary to deduct all Infantry officers shown in the Army List as filling Staff appointments and seconded&#x2014;for instance, a large number required for Mounted Infantry duties, then a large number employed with the Territorial Army, from which they cannot be withdrawn on mobilisation. The result is startling. It is this. If the Expeditionary Force went abroad, taking with it every officer belonging to the seven home battalions, then the Expedi-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0085"/>
<col>119</col>
tionary Force would still be 150 Regular Infantry officers short of its requirements, and not a single Regular Infantry officer would be left with any Regular battalions at home. According to the War Office Returns the plan won't work.<lb/>
On the departure of the Expeditionary Force the lesser half of the home Regular troops must be sent at once to garrison Ireland&#x2014;that is, 7,000 Artillerymen, three battalions, and one regiment of Cavalry for the whole of Ireland, leaving in Great Britain one Regular Infantry Brigade of four battalions, two Cavalry regiments, and some 8.000 Artillery details. So much, or rather so little, of the Regular Army is left for home defence according to the War Office Tables, but referred to by the Secretary of State for War as a&#x2014;
<quote>"very considerable number of Regular troops which in any event we should have at home."</quote>
Now the words "in any event" must include the event of the departure of the whole Expeditionary Force. It is true that on mobilisation all Special Reservists become, not by virtue of any efficiency but by magic of a War Office order, of the same fighting value as Regular soldiers. It is the intention that the Special Reserve shall receive all the unfit from the Line and all the unsound from the Regular Reserve. You may go on adding the unfit to the immature and the untrained to the unsound as much as you please and call them Regular soldiers if you like, but you cannot improvise Regular officers. Neither can you hastily change a drafting depot into a battalion of the Regular Army and use it as such in action against the pick of Continental troops without meeting with (lire disaster. I am glad that this fact has now been recognised by the military authorities.<lb/>
The Secretary of State for War definitely stated, on June 27 last, that the Special Reserve is not for mobilisation. We need go no further. But until that statement was made, I had always assumed that the 27 fourth battalions of the Special Reserve were to be used as battalions. It seems, however, that the Secretary of State for War has consigned them to the general drafting pool. I am not surprised, for this is their condition. Their establishment is only 530 men, and many battalions are not up to establishment. By the Army List for January, 1911, out of an establishment of 28 officers per battalion every single battalion is at least 10 officers
<col>120</col>
deficient, one is short by 20 officers, and two more are each 18 officers deficient. By Appendix VI of the Army Order of December 23, 1907, each of these 27 battalions must send on mobilisation four subalterns to the Regular battalions to help meet the deficiencies of the Line, thereby reducing the number of subalterns available for service with the 27 fourth battalions of the Extra Special Reserve to 12. That is a fraction less than half a subaltern to each battalion. These battalions have no Reserve. On mobilisation their numbers are not even augmented by the unfit and the useless from somewhere else. They have no Brigade organisation and they have no transport. They are mere nucleus battalions, but nucleus battalions without any provision for the addition of men on mobilisation although ample for the subtraction by drafting to the Line. It is certain that, owing to the great shortage of men in the Regular Reserve and to the great shortage of officers in these Extra Special Reserve battalions, that they must be absorbed into the general drafting pool. By the last War Office Return the whole Special Reserve Infantry is 1,357 subalterns deficient from an establishment of 1,915; that is to say, there are 558 subalterns where there ought to be 1,915.<lb/>
So I pass from the Special Reserve, which by the decision of the Secretary of State for War and by the necessity of its composition can be used for drafting purposes only and not for mobilisation, to the Territorial Army. The Territorial Army, although it is our second line in time of peace, will become in time of war our first and only line of military defence after the Regular Army has gone abroad. On the departure of the Expeditionary Force a part of the Territorial Army must be at once sent to garrison Ireland. The present garrison in Ireland, when brought up to war strength&#x2014;and I am dealing with war conditions&#x2014;would be about 36,000 Regular troops. But it would be only reasonable when replacing Regular by Territorial troops to increase that number. At least 45,000 men of the Territorial Army would be required on permanent duty as a garrison for Ireland. This suggests the possibility of the employing of the Territorial Force in aid of the civil power. I understand that under no circumstances can the Territorial Army be employed for this duty. The Secretary of State for War, in answer to a Question on March 16 last, stated that&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0086"/>
<col>121</col>
<quote>"The Territorial Force cannot be called out or embodied in whole or in part in aid of the civil power for the purpose of putting down riots or disturbances."</quote>
The seven Infantry battalions and three regiments of Cavalry left at home are certainly inadequate by themselves for the duty of aiding the civil power throughout the whole of Great Britain and Ireland in time of war. Last year the Government used troops in aid of the civil power in considerable numbers and for a considerable period. Quite recently troops fired 500 rounds of ball cartridge down the streets of London, again in aid of the civil power, and this time in the presence of the Home Secretary himself, and all this in time of profound peace. So it would seem idle to deny that the military force which replaces the Regular Army in the United Kingdom during the stress and strain of war may be required for this very difficult duty.<lb/>
As 45,000 men of the Territorial Army would be required to garrison Ireland, we should be left with 212,257 Territorial soldiers in Great Britain, according to the present strength of the Territorial Army. But that strength is a diminishing strength, as I shall presently show. Moreover, in 1913 the whole batch of recruits who joined the Territorial Army when enlistment was first opened for that force in 1909 will become time-expired. But of this gross total of 212,257 men a portion only can be made available to act as the swiftly moving central field force described by the Secretary of State for War as ready at any moment to crush the Continental invader by sheer weight of numbers. Deductions must be made for men who are physically unfit, for absentees at home and abroad, for men who have emigrated, for recruits untrained, for boys of tender years, of whom there are a vast number in the Territorial Army, and, lastly, for men who have agreed to serve with the Army Reserve on mobilisation and have consequently been absorbed by the Expeditionary Force, thus depriving the Territorial Army of some of its keenest and best soldiers. Then large numbers&#x2014;I cannot give figures, because these are the secrets of mobilisation&#x2014;must be allotted for coast defences and for garrison duties in Great Britain, from which it is obviously impossible to remove them in time of war. Take the case of the garrison of London. We have only four Regular Infantry battalions left in Great Britain, two Cavalry regiments, and some 8,000 Artillery details.<lb/>
<col>122</col>
Are you going to leave London without a single Regular regiment? We know by experience that we have in our midst a hostile alien population armed with the most deadly weapons, and very ready to use them. We know that the ranks of the civil police will be depleted by calling out the Army Reserve, because many policemen are Army Reservists. We know that the Territorial Force cannot be used in aid of the civil power: neither is it fitted for that duty. Of course, garrisons cannot hastily abandon their posts and go flocking haphazard to any expected points of invasion. I suggest to the Under-Secretary of State for War that, after making all these inevitable deductions&#x2014;and the noble Lord cannot deny that they are inevitable&#x2014;the famous swiftly moving central field force cannot exceed 50.000 men, including Regular troops if any are available.<lb/>
Now the Imperial Defence Committee has told us that the Territorial Army should be in the proportion of four to one against an invading force in order to ensure success. Sir John French has told us&#x2014;it is in his evidence before the Norfolk Commission&#x2014;that&#x2014;
<quote>"You must have an enormous preponderance in numbers to overcome deficiency."</quote>
According, then, to the opinion of the Imperial Defence Committee and to the evidence of Sir John French, our available home Field Army of 50,000 men would have no chance against a force of 15,000 Continental invaders, because we should not have the necessary superiority of four to one. Sir Ian Hamilton, in his last book, writes as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"If defeated the Territorial Force would go absolutely to pieces for a time."</quote>
What is going to happen in this interval of time? I presume the occupation of London would be one of the incidents. If you send abroad the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force, as you claim to be easily able to do, then by War Office Returns and by the opinion of the Imperial Defence Committee you cannot hope to deal successfully with 15,000 Continental invaders in Great Britain. In Ireland a force of 10,000 men would be certain of success. This would be the state of affairs according to War Office Returns and the opinion of the Imperial Defence Committee; but the Secretary of State for War tells us&#x2014;
<quote>"I think between these three lines of defence, the first and second naval lines and the military line&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0087"/>
<col>123</col>
behind this triple line of defence we are pretty well protected, and it is a nervous person, I was going to say a cowardly person, who gets into a state of blue funk over these things."</quote>
If we consider for a moment the state of the Territorial Army I think we shall understand the reasons which have induced the Imperial Defence Committee to advise us that the proportion of four to one is essential for safety. We know that in the Territorial Force last November there were 83.346 boys of less than twenty years of age, and that among them there were thousands of boys less than seventeen years old. In April, 1910&#x2014;that is the last complete Return rendered to Parliament of the musketry of the Territorial Army [Cd. 5018]&#x2014;there were 100,000 officers, noncommissioned officers and men not qualified in musketry. We must remember that a Territorial soldier can qualify in musketry without ever having fired upon a full distance range. The question has often been asked but never yet answered by a plain "Yes" or "No," Can a Territorial soldier qualify in musketry by firing a certain number of rounds without ever hitting the mark? As far as I can make out from the Regulations, the answer is "Yes." It would be interesting to know how many of these marksmen are now in the Territorial Army. I do not consider these facts discreditable to officers and men of the Territorial Army in the least. They are inseparable from the nature of the Force. The Territorial Army consists of a mass of patriotic citizens who soldier as much as they can in their spare time on the go-as you please and do-as-you-like plan. For instance, last summer 1,321 officers and 24,000 men did not attend camp at all, so there is sonic latitude allowed in the matter of training. I asked the noble Lord how many officers and men had missed two trainings out of three. The noble Lord explained that to ascertain this number would entail laborious research. I am not surprised that no record is kept at the War Office of officers and men who miss two or three trainings, and are, therefore, scarcely trained at all, because the authors of the Territorial Army never contemplated the Force beginning to carry out military training with any strictness till after war has been declared. General Cowans, the present Director-General of the Territorial Force, said on January 19 last that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial Force was what the Secretary of State himself had called it, a half-baked Force."</quote>
Anyhow, the present state of the Territorial
<col>124</col>
Army is a source of sincere satisfaction to its authors. Indeed, it is exactly what they desired. At least the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War is reported to have said on December 16 last&#x2014;
<quote>"The Force was slowly and steadily going forward and was fulfilling the best expectations of the best critics at the present time."</quote>
The Territorial Force was 1,514 officers and 44,106 men deficient on January 1 last. That is a drop of very nearly 12,000 men since last April.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War is not the least disturbed by the fact of a diminishing intake now and the certainty of an extraordinary outflow in two years time, because on December 16 last he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They had this year felt so encouraged that they were prepared to spend considerably more money on the Territorial Force than they had spent previously."</quote>
These increased grants are, no doubt, designed to check this wasting of the Force. But any effect they might have had in that direction wilt be cancelled by the recent declaration that invasion is impossible. If officers and men have good reason to believe that they will be required to defend their hearths and homes, those who are patriotic will honestly try to make themselves efficient for the expected day of battle. Tell them to sleep quietly in their beds and not to be disturbed by bogies of invasion, tell them that an invasion on even the moderate scale of 70,000 men is practically impossible, and then you will very soon take the whole heart out of the Territorial Army. The Territorial Force deprived of any serious purpose will be regarded, and rightly, as a play-about Army. Yet for all that it seems likely that we are to see a further financial starvation of the Regular Army in order to keep the Territorial Force alive. The financial position is this. War Office Returns and Army Estimates inform us that if half a million more money is spent on the Territorial Army the result will be that in 1913 we shall have Army Estimates as high as in 1905, but 87,676 men fewer amongst those forces which were then available for foreign service. The only setoff against this reduction of nearly 90,000 men in our foreign service line would be the number of men in Section D of the Army Reserve, re-opened for enlistment last year.<lb/>
I cannot refrain from expressing a hope that there will be no more reductions in the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0088"/>
<col>125</col>
Regular Army for the sake of the Territorial Force. For my own part I have always regretted, and I have always opposed, the sweeping reductions made in the Regular Army and the total destruction of the Regular Militia in order to create a force which does not begin professional training till after war has been declared, which cannot be used in aid of the civil power when embodied at home during the absence of the Regular Army, which is forbidden by law from operating in an enemy's country, and whose use, since invasion on even moderate scale has just been declared by the highest naval authority to be impossible, is most obscure. But additional grants have been definitely promised to the Territorial Army. The Government must contemplate higher Array Estimates than in 1905 with the certainty of nearly 90,000 men fewer in the foreign service line, or else they must still further reduce the Regular Army in order to finance the Territorial Force.<lb/>
My Lords, I have dealt with these questions of numbers entirely according to the Returns of the War Office, taking the greatest care never to travel beyond them or to use any figures except those supplied by the Government. In no respect do these War Office Returns support the confident anticipations of the Government, least of all in regard to the Expeditionary Force. War Office Returns show that this Force will be absolutely impossible in the numbers represented to us by the Government. I know no greater boon to a commercial nation than a well-founded sense of security. But assuredly no evil is more dangerous than a false sense of security which rests, not upon facts and upon figures, but upon promises and predictions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00494"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this debate certainly marks a milestone in the progress, or perhaps I should say in the understanding of Army Reform in this House. Though the noble Duke does not praise us for what we have done, there is for the first time in his speech to-night, and in the form in which he has put the Notice on the Paper, a tacit admission on his part that we are carrying out what we set ourselves to do&#x2014;namely, the organisation of an Expeditionary Force of six Divisions, with its Cavalry Division and lines of communications. If five years ago anybody had discussed an Expeditionary Force of that size, lie would have been considered mad. Had you conducted
<col>126</col>
this debate five years ago you would have been discussing, not the possibility of mobilising six Divisions, but the bare possibility of mobilising three, and you would have had great difficulty in doing that and giving them their proper complement of all arms. [Viscount MIDLETON dissented.] The noble Viscount shakes his head. We have discussed it so often. There was a large superfluity of some arms, but the whole difficulty from the point of view of mobilisation on the outbreak of war was that you had not got sufficient of the more requisite arm of all&#x2014;Artillery. We have got it now.<lb/>
The noble Duke based his case, not upon our present position, but upon what the position would be in the year 1913. I gathered from his speech that that is the year which he brings under review. It is the year which he referred to in those articles of Iris which we read during the summer, and it is, we understand, the year in which, in his opinion, we are going to be put to the test. I should like first to say something about our military position in the year 1913. That position will not have been caused by us. It will be one of our inheritances. The reductions which we have made in the Infantry will not in the slightest degree affect our position in that year. If we had not reduced tire battalions and they had continued to exist, not one single man who would have been enlisted into them after the time when they were, as a matter of fact, disbanded could have passed into the Reserve, and it is the condition of the Reserve in 1913 that constitutes, as I understood the noble Duke's speech, the position of danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00495"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Why? Will the noble Lord explain what he means?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00496"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: For the reason that all the men who were in those battalions were absorbed into other battalions, and no man enlisted in 1906 could have affected the Reserve in 1913.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00497"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Surely the men who would have enlisted in these battalions in 1906 would have been passing into the Reserve in 1913.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00498"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: But that is after the critical moment. The position with regard to 1913 is this. We have at the present time&#x2014;I confine myself to the Infantry, because it is only in the Infantry that the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0089"/>
<col>127</col>
position is difficult&#x2014;we have in the Infantry men serving under three different terms of service. From 1002 to 1904 men were enlisted for three years with the Colours, with the option of extending to eight years, and nine in the Reserve. All the three-years men who are now with the Colours are, therefore, the men who have extended and may be called eight-years men. From 1904 to 1906 the terms of service were nine years with the Colours and three in the Reserve, and there are a considerable number of nine-years men. After 1906 we returned to what I think has been the best all-round 'term of service&#x2014;seven years with the Colours and five in the Reserve; and ever since then we have had none but seven-years men in the. Infantry. The men who pass into the Reserve in the years 1910, 1911, and 1912 are the eight-years men who enlisted in 1902, 1903, and 1904. The difficulty about the three-years system was that you did not get enough men to extend. Therefore we find that the eight-years men who will be passing into the Reserve during the three years previous to the critical moment of 1913 will only average 5,500 instead of from 10,000 to 12,000, which is about the normal annual outflow of men into the Reserve. Then in the year 1012 comes the end of the eight-years men who enlisted in 1904, and it is not until 1914 that the nine-years men begin to conic in in any numbers, so that you have a gap during the year 1913 between the end of the eight-years men and the beginning of the nine-years men. The result is that in 1913 the total number of men who pass into the Reserve will be only 2,677, and consequently the Reserve drops to 106,372. Then in 1914 the nine-years men who enlisted in 1905 begin to pass to the Reserve and also the seven-years men who began to come in in 1906. The result is that you get a double flow of men into the Reserve.<lb/>
I should like, having explained that, to call the attention of the House for one moment to the way in which the noble Duke makes up his figures. I think I am right in saying that he takes the normal number of men serving with the Colours as being available on mobilisation. He takes the lowest point which the Reserve ever reaches, and he adds those two together to show that there would be a deficiency. But I should have thought it would not require a very profound student of military matters to realise that when you have the tap which allows men to pass from the Colours to the
<col>128</col>
Reserve practically turned off, you will have a very much larger number of seasoned men available with the Colours than at any other time. It is true that in 1913 the Reserves will be low, and it is because the men who in normal circumstances would be with the Reserves will be with the Colours. Therefore the position, if you look at it only from the Reserve point of view, is not half so bad as it looks, because you have a much larger number of matured men serving with the Colours than at ordinary times. Then in order to complete his figures, although the noble Duke is discussing the year 1913, he takes the Territorial Force in 1910, and he takes their musketry standard of 1909. He pays no attention whatever to what may be the outcome of the Territorial Force Reserve, the Veteran Reserve, then, when, as we think, the Territorial Force will be much nearer its establishment than it is at the present time.<lb/>
The position in 1913 is going to be extremely abnormal, though even if it were left as it is there would not, from the point of view of mobilising the Regular Army, be any danger, and we could do it perfectly well. But, of course, these unevennesses are things that one wants to get rid of if one possibly can, because if you are only to pass 2.600 men to the Reserve in one year and 16,000 men the next year, it is going to knock all your recruiting to pieces, and you will be below establishment. So we are going to do what has been done before with success, namely, allow men who are with the Colours&#x2014;we are not going to put any pressure upon them&#x2014;to go to the Reserve prematurely. That is to say, some of the 16,000 men who will be passing out in 1914 and some of the 21,000 men who will be passing out in 1915 will be allowed, if they wish, to go into the Reserve in 1913. That was done in the time of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, and met, as I have said, with success. By that means, if we can stimulate the flow into the Reserve it will not affect the general position on mobilisation, but it will help us to equalise the number of recruits who are wanted, and the drafts to India, and other matters of that sort.<lb/>
We have also taken steps of another kind. We have increased the additional numbers, or the pool, considerably. It is already very nearly double what it normally is, and we shall probably, before we have done, treble it. This is a second string to our bow if we
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0090"/>
<col>129</col>
do not get sufficient numbers to transfer. I will explain the pool. It is allowing the establishment of the Infantry battalions at home to be exceeded, to recruit beyond their establishment, and it really will have the same effect as raising the establishment of the Infantry, and it is clone with the object of tiding us over the bad time and of meeting the big outflow of men into the Reserve. Therefore the position in 1913, as far as we can see, will not be so bad as the noble Duke makes out, and, in the next place, we shall probably by these means approach to something about the normal.<lb/>
Now I come to the question of the general position of this country both in regard to the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force and our position after the Expeditionary Force has left these shores. As to that I state what the position was in June, 1910. We have, as a matter of fact, got later figures, but sonic of them are not checked, and I prefer to give figures that have been checked throughout. The position last December was a little different from this, but not different in essentials. In June, 1910, we had 124,129 Regulars. Of those there would be detailed to the Expeditionary Force 68,141, leaving at home 55,988. Then comes the Regular Reserve, the strength of which at that time was 136,663. You have to deduct from that ten per cent. for wastage and unfitness. The noble Duke challenges that ten per cent., but it is the actual deduction which we have found by experience it is necessary to make. You have also to deduct further, some 7,000 odd Reservists who are serving abroad and not available on mobilisation. That brings down the numbers to 116,811. Some 81,000 of these men are required, leaving 34,871. Then there is the Special Reserve, consisting of 65,106 men, and there would be required 5,691 of those men already enlisted, leaving a total of 59,455. Then you have the Territorial Force, 260,981 men; the Militia and Militia Reserve, 4,076; and the Regular Reserve from abroad, who would not be available on mobilisation but would be thrown in as the war proceeded, 7,225. That gives you your Expeditionary Force, and it gives you also 422,596 men, of whom 98,084 would be Regulars and Regular Reservists&#x2014;that is, after deducting the ten per cent. It will be seen, therefore, that for the purpose of the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force last June there was an ample margin in every particular. The
<col>130</col>
55,988 Regulars do not by any means all represent men under twenty years of age. Similarly with the Regular Reserve, there are 34,000 men left over. That is the figure which will be altered when we come to the normal in that respect. The position last June was abnormal. When we come to the normal, the Regular Reserve instead of being 136,000 will, according to our calculations, be 126,000, and that will make the surplus left at home 24,000 instead of 34,000.<lb/>
The noble Duke asks me about Section D. We have had some discussion upon that before. It is impossible to say how many men of Section D will be employed, for the reason that the requirements of different Infantry battalions vary so much. It may be possible that the gross total of Section A and Section B men may be quite sufficient to mobilise the whole of the Regular Infantry, but it is possible that there will be a certain number of battalions which will have to fall back on Section D again, because Section A and Section B may, for the reasons I have given, be abnormally low. Therefore it is impossible to say what the position would be in regard to Section D, but under normal circumstances Section D will number 26,000 men. The surplus of the Regular Reserve not absorbed by the Expeditionary Force, after deductions fir men abroad, will give you 24,000 men left over, which is within 2,000 of the figure required for Section D. I think that shows that our position with regard to the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force both now and when we reach the normal is perfectly secure. We could at the present moment mobilise the whole of the six Divisions, and, with a certain amount of improvisation in arms which are not; the fighting ones, we could get the Cavalry Divisions and the lines of communication complete. Our chief difficulty is in the Army Service Corps, but our needs there are being decreased every day by the introduction of mechanical transport. Really the only important thing in which we should have to make a certain amount of improvisation is in the matter of the Royal Army Medical Corps, where we should want 1,000 men.<lb/>
On the question of the Reserve, it is perfectly true that we have stated that we have 200,000 men at the present moment who are liable by their terms of service as a reserve for the Regular Army, but, after
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0091"/>
<col>131</col>
all, the basis of our scheme has not been that they should be immediately available. The reason why we converted the Militia into the Special Reserve was that they should give us the means of replacing wastage, and that the supply should last over a considerable period. There lies the <i>crux</i> of the whole thing. Out of the 98,000 Regulars left at home when you mobilise, a number of those men will be Section D men, who, to take the worst estimate, would not be men whom you would desire to have until, at any rate, you had given them a certain amount of training. There will be the immature soldiers and the Special Reservists. Those men are not intended to be immediately used on mobilisation. They would not be used until they had had a certain amount of training on embodiment. The result is that you have a very large reservoir there which will be gradually ripening, and which will enable you in three months, six months, or in a year or two years, as you want them, to maintain your Expeditionary Force in the field. We have never thought that a great part of those men would be immediately available, and we have not intended that they should be.<lb/>
I pass to the question of the Special Reserve. The noble Duke occasionally when he lets himself go, gets quite lurid on the subject of the Special Reserve. I remember a good many things that he said in his article in the <i>Morning Post</i> on the subject of the Special Reserve. However, he has not said very much about them this afternoon. It has always been the contention of the critics of the Special Reserve that that Reserve was simply a funnel through which men passed on their way into the Regular Army. All that we have said was that it was impossible to say at the time exactly what was going to be the effect, but that, as far as we could see, there would be a certain number of men who would remain and serve out their time as Special Reservists. We have now available a certain basis of calculation&#x2014;though it is not very much&#x2014;upon which some comparison of the Special Reserve with the old Militia can be made. The average number of men of the Militia who used to pass on and enlist in the Regular Army was 42 per cent. In the last two years 47 per cent. of the Special Reserve have passed on to the Regular Army, so that there is only a difference between the two of 5 per cent. It therefore looks as if the
<col>132</col>
old conditions under the Militia are, in that respect at least, being reproduced under the Special Reserve. Another satisfactory point is that the result of another year's work shows that the percentage of men under twenty years of age has decreased. Last year I think it was two per cent. over what it used to be in the Militia. This year it is just about the same as in the Militia in 1905&#x2014;namely, twenty-seven per cent.<lb/>
This is the crucial point with regard to the Special Reserve: If we do not get a sufficient number of men of the Special Reserve to stay on, and if the contention of the noble Duke and other critics should prove to be true that it is simply a funnel, then we will frankly admit that the Special Reserve will have failed in the purposes for which it was intended. But, as far as we can see, the position as it was in the old Militia is being more or less reproduced. We do not consider that satisfactory, and when my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War makes his statement in introducing the Army Estimates in another place, he will take the opportunity of announcing certain modifications and alterations which we are going to make in the Special Reserve for the coming year. But, generally speaking, according to the reports which we have received about them, the Special Reserve is a success. There is no doubt that it is a much better Force compared with the old Militia. Of course, they are the same in a great many particulars. The age of enlistment is the same, the physical standard as regards measurements is the same, the percentage under twenty is about the same, and the percentage who join the Regulars is about the same; but, on the other hand, the Special Reserve men are longer and better trained. We find, as a result of last year's training, that it is those battalions which have the smallest number of old Militia men in them which are best reported upon from the point of view of efficiency. Again in the very severe test that we put them to by calling them out for the last Man&#x0153;uvres and making them do work which they would not have to do on mobilisation because we brought them straight up and made them march the day that they joined, which could not happen to them on mobilisation&#x2014;they acquitted themselves well, and were favourably spoken of by the officers who had to do with them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0092"/>
<col>133</col>
There is one point in particular as to which a considerable improvement is noticeable&#x2014;that is, the general physical soundness of the Special Reserve. The physical standard as regards measurements is the same, but, having regard to the liability of the men to serve abroad, great care is taken to ensure a higher standard of health as well as greater efficiency. The noble Duke is in the habit of saying that the Special Reserve is an altogether inferior force. I would remind him that we insist on their bringing references when they join, which was not done in the Militia. Nevertheless, I have seen them described by the noble Duke as being the "conscripts of hunger," as being drawn from a lower strata of humanity, and as being the unemployed or the unemployable, whereas the Militia was said to be the only force which was capable of carrying out the arduous duty of reinforcing the Regular Army abroad. Be that as it may, the Militia was not without its faults. I was told a story which I think will be of interest to the noble Duke because it concerns his battalion. In 1893 there was a Brigade of Militia, training at Aldershot. In that Brigade was the noble Duke's battalion, as well as the battalion now commanded by the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury. At the end of the training, out of this Brigade 140 men decided to volunteer for enlistment in the Regular Army, and they were sent up to undergo medical examination. Fewer than six of those men were accepted, the others being rejected. Another interesting point is this, that last summer during the three training months we were rather surprised to observe that there were more men being invalided out of the Special Reserve than were joining it. On inquiring the reason we found that, owing to the strict medical test now applied, a very large number of the old Militiamen who had transferred had to be invalided out of the service. There is no question at all that the Special Reserve is better trained, that the physical health of the men is better, that the standards are altogether higher, and that the Special Reservists are in a far better position to fulfil the important role that we have assigned to them than the old Militia ever were.<lb/>
I pass from that to the question of officers. I never have, I hope, held out any very rosy picture with regard to the supply of officers. It has always been a
<col>134</col>
very difficult problem, and there is no doubt that we have not solved it yet. We have sufficient officers for the purpose of mobilising the six Divisions, but we have not got anything like the number on the scale of supplying wastage over a considerable time. There is one satisfactory feature, and that is the working of the Officers Training Corps.</membercontribution></p>

It is of considerable size now, and the movement is being taken up with the greatest keenness in the public schools and Universities. Ninety-six officers have already taken commissions in the Special Reserve, and 242 in the Territorial Force. Another satisfactory feature is that, partly through the existence of the Officers Training Corps, the Universities have taken more interest in the Army than they used to do, and the supply of University candidates for the Regular Army has increased considerably.<lb/>
I do not wish to go into a long and detailed exposition with regard to the Territorial Force. I maintain absolutely the truth of my previous statement which the noble Duke quoted, that the improvement which the Territorial Force has shown during the past year has been very marked indeed. It has been remarked upon by all the very distinguished Regular Officers who command it directly, or under whose command it comes, or who have had the opportunity of seeing it and inspecting its work in the field. As I have said, we are perfectly satisfied with the improvement that is being made. The system is by no
<col>136</col>
means complete yet. We are still at work devising fresh means for improving its efficiency and its training, but there can be no question that it is fulfilling the purpose for which it was originally designed. We should have in this country, therefore, during the early period after mobilisation, the time when the Territorial Force would be at its weakest, 422,000 men, of whom 98,000 would be Regulars. When we reach the normal that will be reduced by 14,000, but again may well be increased by the Territorial Force, and that will give you, not what the noble Duke said was required by the Committee of Imperial Defence, a Force of four to one, but of six to one, as compared with that which any possible invader might bring against it. There are not, therefore, on these figures any grounds for saying that our provision for home defence, in the event of the Expeditionary Force leaving these shores, is in any way inadequate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00513"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the difficulty one feels in following the noble Lord is not that he has not conscientiously endeavoured to meet the very detailed criticisms of the noble Duke behind me. If I may venture to say so, I think the noble Lord makes a mistake in attempting to defend every item of the indictment that has been made against him. In the first place, I do not think he can satisfactorily do so, and, if your Lordships will pardon me, I will endeavour to draw together the figures in the noble Duke's elaborate and admirable statement which have not been shaken in the slightest by the noble Lord's reply. In discussing the position in 1913 the noble Lord tried to prove that if the men of the battalions which were disbanded by Mr. Haldane seven years before had not been disbanded there would not have been a larger Reserve than there would be after they had been disbanded. No amount of elaborate argument can possibly prove that, if you disband nine battalions of 700 men apiece, even if you distribute those men among other battalions, the men you would have enlisted in those battalions, at the rate of 300 a year, would not have passed into the Reserve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00514"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: My point was that they would not be in the Reserve in 1913, which is the year the noble Duke has laid stress upon in his criticism as being the dangerous period.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0094"/>
<col>137</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00515"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke's point was that by 1913 all the three-years men would cease to pass into the Reserve, and that all the men who would have passed into the Reserve if Mr. Haldane had not broken up those battalions would not be forthcoming. But I do not wish to elaborate that point. I protest against the tone of exaggeration in which the noble Lord imitates the Secretary of State for War in statements which he cannot possibly make good, which do not deceive anybody who knows the facts&#x2014;though I am sure the noble Lord genuinely believes them himself&#x2014;and which are entirely at variance with all the figures which can be culled from official documents. I will give an instance. The noble Lord congratulated the noble Duke on having made a step forward and on having treated as a serious matter the probable power of the country to send six Divisions abroad. I do not intend to be drawn into a duel as to what it was possible to do a short time ago and what it is now possible to do. What we want to be assured is that the six Divisions which are spoken of can be sent abroad, and that when they have gone there will be at home a force which can be mobilised. I challenge in every particular the statement that the noble Lord has advanced a single man on the numbers who could be mobilised five years ago, except with regard to the Reserve which was then being made up but which could not be made up fully until the men enlisted by the noble Marquess could have gone to the Reserve. I throw that out as a challenge, and I will make it good on any occasion and against any competitor. I say that His Majesty's Government have not advanced one single Regular since that time, except in regard to those whom we enlisted but who had not then become effective. But that is not the point which I rose to make.<lb/>
The noble Duke's figures as to what the strength of the Expeditionary Force could be have not been disproved in any single particular by the noble Lord. The noble Duke took for his text the statement of the Secretary of State that we are 90,000 men stronger now, and that we can, therefore, send 160,000 men abroad. That number has lately been advanced to 180,000. The noble Duke proved by figures that, taking into consideration the Special Reserve, you are not 90,000 men stronger, but 87,000 men weaker. You cannot have it both ways. You have reduced the Army Reserve by
<col>138</col>
31,000 men. You say you are going to make that up to some extent by taking in Section D men of more than twelve years' service. It was equally open, with an Army Reserve of 136,000 men, to take in Section D men and make that number up to 160,000. Therefore, in so far as you make a comparison you are weaker by the 31,000 men you have knocked off than you were when you came into office.<lb/>
To place against the reductions shown by the noble Duke there is the fact that the Special Reserve is now available for foreign service. I was very much struck with the account which the noble Lord gave of the increased care now being taken to secure the medical fitness of the Special Reserve as compared with the old Militia. I by no means desire to pass any sort of stricture on the usefulness of that Force. But I would point out that the noble Lord, while he was eloquent as to the power of the country to send these six Divisions abroad, did not deal with any of the points I am now going to mention. In the first place, the noble Duke alleged that when the Expeditionary Force had been sent abroad, every Infantry Regular officer in the country would have been taken, and that you would have left at home a large body of heterogeneous troops, men serving with the Colours who were unfit to go abroad, some Reservists who had been abroad and had come back, and others&#x2014;98,000 in all. I ask, Is the noble Duke correct when he says that every Infantry Regular officer would have left the country and that these troops would remain without a Regular officer to command them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00516"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00517"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Then I would suggest to the noble Lord that he should give us distinct figures in support of that. If the noble Duke is correct, it is a most serious statement. It is one that requires to be refuted, because it involves the whole question of the usefulness of the force left at home. Again, we ought to be told what number of boys enlisted at seventeen are included in the estimates of 200,000 for the Regular Reserve, and what number of the 426,000, after you have taken the Special Reservists you mean to send abroad, are men whom you really can turn out for service at home. Then, again, what about the officers of the Special Reserve? The noble Marquess asked a question on that
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0095"/>
<col>139</col>
point, and I think we ought to have been told whether it is true that the Special Reserve is so deficient in officers that it could not be mobilised in case of invasion. It is a serious error that we should be told that there are 200,000 men in the Regular Reserve when the figures include boys of seventeen belonging to the Special Reserve who could no more be employed as Regular Reservists than if they had never joined. The citation of these large figures, such as 426,000 troops remaining in England, is misleading. We ought to know how many of that large force have got officers, and for how many there would be Artillery left in the country. Not a word was said about Artillery&#x2014;a most important point. I do not ask how many would have transport and equipment, but on the occasion when the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts brings forward his Motion I shall press for an answer to the question&#x2014;What is the military composition of the troops that will remain after these six Divisions have gone abroad, and how many of the 426,000 could be mobilised to-morrow as an organised force with proper officers?<lb/>
I do not wish to say a word to-night to depreciate any of our forces, but I do ask your Lordships to remember that, even in the elaborate answer prepared by the Under-Secretary, he has not for a moment disputed the great reduction in Regulars, the great reduction in the Army Reserve, the great reduction in the Artillery, and the fact that corps which you cannot organise in a hurry have been reduced below the level at which they were left in 1905, and lie has by no means shown us that this great heterogeneous body of troops which he mentions exists except on paper, because we do not know that they have the requisite number of officers and scientific corps. When we return to this matter, as we must do, I hope we shall be told whether there is an adequate defence force after the six Divisions have gone. I hope the noble Lord will not mind my pressing him on a subsequent occasion to release us from this mass of figures and show us perfectly clearly what is the military force available in the country after the six Divisions have gone, taking only into account those men who could really be paraded and for whom officers and the proper equipment of scientific corps could be found.</membercontribution></p>

I would ask the noble Lord to give his careful attention to this point when he returns to the War Office. You cannot open a single page of the Army List on which Infantry regiments appear without finding that the officers are counted twice over&#x2014;namely, under the Regular battalions and under the Special Reserve battalions. At any rate, it would seem to the ordinary observer that they are counted twice over, and I would ask the noble Lord to look into the matter when lie is again verifying figures which are supplied to him.</membercontribution></p>

I can give the information from page 27 of the Annual Return of the Army. In the Cavalry of the Line there ought to be 752 officers; there are 732. In the Artillery there ought to be 1,128; there are 1,070. In the Infantry of the Line there ought to be 4,682; there are 4,550. The noble Duke referred to the men in Section D and quoted the words of two General Officers who had had Section D men under them. Let me ask him to look at this return. He will there see that in the whole strength of Section D there are only 111 men&#x2014;a mere bagatelle of the whole&#x2014;over 40 years of age.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00525"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: I am taking the last Return, and the figures I have given represent the state of affairs at that time. What is going to take place in the future it is impossible to foresee. I would observe, further, that it is incorrect to designate the Territorial Force as one composed of immature boys. The Territorial Force is 260,000 strong. Of that Force those under seventeen only number 2,079. It is impossible correctly to designate the Force in the way the noble Duke did because there happens to be a small percentage under seventeen. The noble Duke, and the noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, are continually asking questions as to how many of the men are under twenty years of age. The fact of a man being under twenty does not make him an inefficient soldier. There were thousands of soldiers under twenty who fought in the Battle of Waterloo, and numbers of soldiers from eighteen to twenty
<col>142</col>
were sent to the Crimea. Even to-day, if you look in <i>The Times</i>, you will see that at Sydney the Government there have passed a law by which every man after the age of eighteen shall be enlisted for the defence of his country and properly trained. These young men do just as well as men much older. I cannot follow the noble Duke in his elaborate attack on the Territorial Force. Who would suppose that if we were likely to have an invasion of this country we should send an Expeditionary Force of 180,000 men abroad? According to the noble Duke, we are to assume, not only that we should send 180,000 men abroad, but that the Fleet would be pierced and that we would be left without anything but the Territorial Army to rely upon. Such a supposition is absurd.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00557">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00558"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD, LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I do not propose to say much, but I think it is due to the House to say a little. This Bill is the first of a series of Bills which, as I have stated to the House, I propose to introduce for the purpose of the consolidation and codification of the criminal law of this country. This is a thing in itself very desirable, both for our own sakes at home and also because there has been from time to time a demand from the Colonies and Dependencies of the Crown for some statutory statement of what the criminal law of England really is, so that they might adapt it as far as they could. The Bill was read a second time in the last Parliament, and referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, over which I had the honour to preside. We met some eight or ten times, and we did our very best simply to reproduce the existing law both statutory and common. That, I think, we have succeeded in substance in doing.<lb/>
It is only right, however, to tell your Lordships that the Bill introduces a very slight alteration in the law, which arises
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0098"/>
<col>145</col>
from the fact that there are scores, if not hundreds, of different Acts of Parliament which contain the laws relating to perjury and the punishment of it, and to false statements not on oath and the punishment of them, and these we had to consolidate with the common law on the subject. It so happened that those who had drawn many of these Acts in the past never took the slightest trouble to see that the punishments for the same class of offence in one Act corresponded to the punishments for the same class of offence in the other Acts of Parliament, and if, therefore, we had absolutely reproduced the offences and the punishments for them as they appear in the Statutes we would have had an enormous schedule which would have shown not any very great diversity, but still diversity, without any apparent reason and without any practical justification.<lb/>
What the Joint Committee say is this&#x2014;
<quote>"As the Bill was originally introduced it contained a schedule so as to preserve the existing punishments unaltered (see Clause 5 and First Schedule;, and as an example of the diversity of these punishments the Committee. would draw attention to the case of the Government Annuities Acts. By the Act of 1853 a false declaration under that Act is made punishable as perjury; that is to say, it renders the offender liable to the maximum punishment of seven years' penal servitude. By the Act of 18872 false declarations for the purposes of the Government Annuities Acts (including the Act of 1853) are made punishable with the maximum. term of twelve months' imprisonment."</quote>
They give other illustrations, and then the Committee say this, as summing up what we thought it was necessary to do&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee recognise that the amendments they have introduced in Clauses 5 and 6, for the purpose of making punishments more uniform and generalising the law so as to make it applicable to false statements under future as well as past Acts, go beyond codification and consolidation in the strict sense. But unless such a change be made the Committee consider that it would hardly be worth while to attempt to codify the law at all, and they think it undesirable that so small an obstacle should prevent the realisation of so desirable an object; the more so as the alterations they are making are merely in the maximum punishments which may be inflicted, and generally in the direction of decreasing them, and will in practice probably have little or no effect on the punishments actually awarded."</quote>
With that exception, and it was an exception absolutely necessary unless we were to introduce a large schedule which would make the Bill so cumbrous that it would be of no value to anybody, we have loyally attempted to reproduce the existing law. It has been a very laborious business
<col>146</col>
&#x2014;twelve pages of the Bill are taken up with repeals of old Statutes&#x2014;and I am sure that all the members of the Committee did their very best and we came to a unanimous decision without having differed upon any single point. I trust that, in these circumstances, your Lordships will not think it necessary in this Parliament to again send to another Committee, which would probably be composed of the same persons, a Bill which was so fully considered only last year, but will accept the finding of that Committee as if it were made this year. I understand that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice proposes to introduce one Amendment in Committee which I believe I shall be able to assent to altogether. I hope my noble and learned friend will not have more Amendments, because, if we are to try to work this business out on the floor of the House, we cannot do it. It is far too detailed and complicated, and I hope your Lordships will take it on the faith of the Committee. </membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00559">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Chancellor.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00560"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to tender my personal thanks to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor for his extreme courtesy in this matter. He was good enough not only to send me the Report of the Committee before it was published, but he also allowed me to see the draft of the Bill and the reports of the draftsmen on the various changes&#x2014;a privilege I had no right to expect, but which has been of the greatest assistance to me. I should like to be allowed to congratulate the Lord Chancellor on the Bill, and to assure him, speaking for the Judges, barristers, and other practitioners, that we are deeply indebted to him and the Committee. I need only mention, as indicating the extent of the Committee's labours, that the Schedule repeals from 100 to 200 Acts of Parliament. One could never be quite certain, when one took up these Acts, that there was not some amending Act which required to be considered; and although, of course, there are valuable text books, the administration of the law with regard to perjury has always been a matter of very great difficulty. A further illustration of the value of the Bill is afforded by the fact that under Clauses 5 and 6 alone the punishments under twenty
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0099"/>
<col>147</col>
Acts have been made uniform, whereas, previously, there was a discrepancy as to what the maximum sentence might be. It is very important to have such a law as that of perjury in as few clauses as possible. There is one other amendment of the law to which the Lord Chancellor has not called attention. By Clause 1, sub-clause (6) it is provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"The question whether a statement on which perjury is assigned was material is a question of law to be determined by the Court of trial."</quote>
The question whether the materiality of a statement should be treated as a question of fact and left to the jury or should be decided as a matter of law has been a good deal discussed for many years. This Bill decides, rightly in my judgment, that materiality should be a question of law, as it is difficult to convey to juries what is material. There may be statements which are morally wrong, but which, after all, may not be essential or material. I sincerely trust that this Bill, which is only the precursor of many other Bills, will not only be read a second time, but will be passed into law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00561"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with interest to the statement of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack in moving the Second Reading of this Bill. It is obviously impossible in the case of a Bill of this kind, which deals with a great number of Statutes, to go into detail. The Bill must be taken on trust. It has been examined by the Joint Committee presided over by my noble and learned friend; it has been read by those most competent to express an opinion on the subject; and as it has passed their criticism I am sure none of your Lordships would lightly desire to intervene in such a difficult and complicated matter. There is only one point to which I would call attention. I refer to the clause which excludes Ireland front the operation of the Bill. I always prefer, if possible, that when there is an amendment made in the law it should be extended to Ireland, rather than that a separate Codification Bill should be required for that country. I do not, however, intend to make that a subject of discussion. I merely rose to express my entire approval of the course suggested by my noble and learned friend.</membercontribution></p>

<ol>
<li>1. What was the establishment of the Territorial Army in officers and men on 1st January, 1911.</li>
<li>2. What was its actual strength on the same date.</li>

<li>(<i>c</i>) had completed a full course of musketry, and fired at an open range.</li>
</ol></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00591"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first question is 11,210 officers and 301,262 non-commissioned officers and men. The answer to the second question is 9.696 officers and 257,156 non-commissioned officers and men. As to the third question, we have no particulars regarding the ages on January 1, 1911, but we have the ages on October 1, 1910. At that time, out of a strength of 257,337 non-commissioned officers and men, 83,088 were under twenty years of age.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0102"/>
<col>153</col>
As to the number who did fifteen or more days training in camp during the year 1910, the figures were 7,102 officers and 161,073 non-commissioned officers and men. The answer to the last part of the third question is that out of 195,585 non-commissioned officers and men who have to do a course of musketry 180,724 were tested in the standard test on an open range.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00592"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask my noble friend whether there would be any practical difficulty in getting, up to a more recent date, a statement with regard to the number of men under twenty years of age. The noble Lord has only been able to give the number up to October 1 last year. Would there be any difficulty in obtaining the return up to January 1, 1911? As regards musketry, the noble Lord has not answered my question in the form in which I asked it. I inquired how many men out of the total strength had completed a full course of musketry and fired at an open range. Could the noble Lord answer that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00593"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Earl will not press me on the question of a later return as to age. There is only a difference of three months between the date as to which I have given the figures and the date in the noble Earl's question. To give the figures at the later date would mean asking from every unit for a special return of the age of every man, and an enormous amount of clerical labour would be involved. I should have thought that the figures as they were in October would have been sufficient. The figures, however, would, on the whole, be better on January 1 last than before, as we take few recruits between October and January and certain of the men in the ranks would during that time be passing the age of twenty. Therefore I hope the noble Earl will not press me on this point. I do not think the result obtained would be sufficiently different from the figures I have given to justify the labour involved. The strength of the men who do the musketry course was 195,585, and of that number 180,724 had been tested in the standard test on an open range. If I had stated that only 180,000 odd men had been tested in the standard test it might have conveyed an erroneous impression, for there are certain arms in the Territorial Force who
<col>154</col>
do not have to go through a course of musketry. It is not the case that out of the whole strength of the force 180,000 odd men only passed. You have always to take into consideration the fact that there are a considerable number of men whose military duties do not render it necessary for them to do musketry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00594"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether we quite gathered the explanation given by the noble Lord at the close of his remarks. In reply to Question No. 2, the noble Lord stated the strength at, I think. 257,000, in round figures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00595"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00596"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Do we understand that out of that strength only 180,000 have completed a full course of musketry? The noble Lord pointed out that only 195,000 odd were expected to go through the musketry course. So that the number is 180,000 out of a possible 195,000?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00597"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes. The men whose military duties do not render it necessary for them to do musketry include the Garrison Artillery and the Royal Army helical Corps, and it is not compulsory for the Army Service Corps.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00598"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Would the noble Lord find any difficulty, in reference to what took place the other night, in giving us in a succinct form the shortage in officers on, say, January 1 last, taking care that no officer detailed from the Regulars to the Special Reserve is shown twice over? Would there be any difficulty in giving us that return?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00599"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I will ask my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War. Perhaps the noble Viscount will give me notice of the question.</membercontribution></p>

I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill, the object of which is to amend the Parsonages Act, 1838, and the Church Building Act, 1839. The Bill has been once through your Lordships' House in all its stages, and on a previous occasion it was introduced and discussed, but it has never received the slightest objection from any quarter that I am aware of either inside or outside Parliament. It deals with a technical matter&#x2014;namely, with certain powers belonging to the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, which they wish to have enlarged, with regard to the disposal of moneys realised from the sale of parsonage houses. I could again explain to your Lordships the provisions of the Bill, but it would weary rather than
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0105"/>

interest you were I to do so. I explained them fully last session [5 H.L. Deb. 5s., p. 954 and I venture to hope that, in view of the fact that the Bill has emanated from the Governors, who have considered it in detail and are agreed upon the subject, and been fully considered outside without any objection of any sort being raised, your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00634"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the Bill which your Lordships have just read a second time, this Bill has been frequently before your Lordships' House, and on the last occasion it passed through all its stages here. I do not, therefore, propose to reiterate the objects of the Bill. There is only one change of any consequence, and it refers to the supply of liquors to children. An Amendment was necessary in order to meet the provisions of the Children's Act of 1908. The new provision in this Bill is to allow, under a certificate of the justices, particular public-houses to be exempt from the provisions of Section 120 of the Children's Act, 1908. I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00635">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lamington,.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00636"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I gather from the title of this Bill and the Memorandum attached. to it that my noble friend's object is to improve the condition of public-houses. As I have given a good deal of thought and time to this task, I could not possibly take exception in principle to a Bill which has such a laudable object. There is no doubt, as my noble friend pointed out when he moved the Second Reading of the Bill on the last occasion, that in exercising their discretion in licensing matters justices are very often influenced by prejudice, and do exercise
<col>160</col>
their discretion in a manner to prevent public-houses being improved and being used for catering, refreshments, and quite harmless purposes. It is to prevent that that my noble friend has introduced this Bill but I am very doubtful whether it is possible by any legislation to restrict the action of the justices in this one particular without also very seriously limiting their jurisdiction in matters where, in my opinion, it is vital they should retain it. I think my noble friend himself is aware of this danger because he endeavours, by a proviso at the end of Clause I, to give back to the justices the very discretion which he takes away from them by the earlier words of the Clause. I confess I am not at all satisfied with the wording of this proviso. The proviso states that the provisions of this Bill are not to apply in cases where, in the opinion of the licensing justices, any alteration in the premises or fittings would&#x2014;
<quote>"merely have the effect of increasing the consumption of intoxicating liquors."</quote>
I think it would be almost impossible to bring forward cases where the premises of a public-house had been improved or enlarged in which it could be said that the chief effect of those alterations had "merely been to increase the consumption of alcoholic liquors," because, even supposing the consumption of alcoholic liquors had been increased by the alterations to the premises, it is almost certain that other effects would also have taken place. Therefore the presence of the word "merely" in the proviso is a serious objection to the whole clause.<lb/>
Then again, I think there is considerable objection to the new clause to which my noble friend referred. It was not, I think, in the last draft of his Bill. My noble friend said that it was rendered necessary by the provisions in the Children's Act. That, I think, is hardly a correct expression of the effect of this new clause. Your Lordships are probably aware that under the law at present children are admitted to those parts of a public-house where there is no bar. They are only excluded from the rooms of a public-house which contain a bar. The effect, therefore, of Clause 2 of this Bill would be to allow children to be introduced into public-houses in those rooms where there is also a bar. It would, in fact, lead to the creation of a sort of schedule of two different
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0106"/>
<col>161</col>
classes of public-houses&#x2014;those which were merely drinking shops and those which also supplied food and light refreshments; the result of which would be that children would be admitted in one class to all parts of a house in that class, and excluded from another. I feel that the House ought to pause before accepting a Bill with this clause in it. But both of the matters which I have raised are Committee matters. I only mention them now in order to warn my noble friend that some criticism will he levelled against these particular points in his Bill when we get into Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00637"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have on previous occasions expressed my strong opposition to this Bill or a Bill analogous to it, and I must say that my sense of almost despair at the prospect which this Bill opens up only increases on further consideration. The noble Earl who has just spoken has treated the very grave objections to the Bill which he indicated as though they were subject-matter for Committee, but there is not a line in this Bill which is not open to the objections&#x2014;the unanswerable objections&#x2014;raised by the noble Earl.<lb/>
There are two clauses in this Bill, apart from the formal clause, and the first of those clauses would destroy the discretion of the licensing justices in most important matters relating to the licensing laws. It would obliterate the discretion of the licensing justices, because if a man hereafter, supposing this Bill to pass into law, were to come and ask for the structural alteration and extension of his premises, and he said that he wanted to do this work in order to provide accommodation for the supply of food or light refreshments, permission could not be denied to him. The justices would be obliged to grant it under this clause. Yet the extension might be used, when it had been constructed, for the general expansion of his business. In the same sort of way, if he wanted an alteration for the purpose of making his premises, or any part thereof, more open, airy, commodious, or comfortable, he would be entitled to enlarge to any extent without the consent of the justices, and over their heads. He could also do so for the purpose of the provision of games, other than unlawful games, newspapers, music, gardens, or any other means of useful recreation, thereby adding to what is essentially a drinking place any kind of
<col>162</col>
attraction which would tend, although that might not be the first and obvious reason, to increase or enlarge the consumption of drink in that place.<lb/>
There is a proviso, which the noble Earl pointed out, that&#x2014;
<quote>"no alteration in the premises or fittings, the chief object of which would be, in the opinion of the licensing justices, merely to increase the consumption of intoxicating liquors, shall he deemed to come within the provisions of this section."</quote>
That is to say, if the alteration has other effects as well as increasing the consumption of liquor, away goes the discretion of the licensing justices. That is a provision which, I am quite certain, in the enlightened days in which we live now in regard to this subject, has not the ghost of a chance of passing the other House of Parliament. whatever majority may sit there, and I sincerely hope that it will not pass this House either. It is, to my mind, destructive. It goes a considerable distance towards destroying the thing upon which we chiefly rely in controlling this admittedly dangerous trade&#x2014;a trade which, in my opinion, is not half sufficiently controlled already, and the control over which is now sought to be abated by the first provision of this Bill.<lb/>
The second provision is, to my mind, although not so serious in effect, in a sense more serious in principle. There is in the Children's Act of 1908 a law preventing children from being admitted to a bar&#x2014;and who is there who cares for children and for the community at large who is otherwise than anxious to maintain a provision of that kind? What does this Bill do? I will read the Clause&#x2014;
<quote>"Where licensed premises are not merely places for the consumption of intoxicating liquors, but contain adequate provision for the supply of food and light refreshments, and are airy, commodious, and comfortable, the licensing justices shall, on the application of the holder of the licence, certify&#x2014;</quote>
It is, your Lordships will see, compulsory upon them to do so&#x2014;
<quote>"certify to that effect, and any premises so certified shall be exempt from the provisions of Section 120 of the Children's Act, 1908."</quote>
That is to say, children may be allowed, notwithstanding the Act, to go into the bars if the licensed premises are not merely places for the consumption of intoxicating liquors, but contain certain adequate provision for the supply of light refresh-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0107"/>
<col>163</col>
ments. That is undoing an Act which is only two months more than two years old, and which was passed for the protection of little children in this country. I decline to believe that your Lordships will agree to give such a Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00638"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words in reply. I fancy that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack thinks that this is an insidious attempt on the part of those interested in the liquor trade to get greater facilities for their trade. The whole intention of this Bill is exactly the reverse. The noble and learned Lord said that in these days it would be absurd to pass legislation of this character. As a matter of fact, the object of the Bill is to improve the tone of public-houses, to make them more respectable, to bring about a higher principle so that they should not be mere drinking dens. I do not know what will pass in another place, but I trust that your Lordships, having given a Second Reading to this Bill on a previous occasion, will again read it a second time. The whole object of the Bill is the reverse of what the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack tries to make out. The Children's Act is rather vague as to which part of the premises children may enter. The definition in that Act of what is an open bar is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"In this section the bar of licensed premises means any open drinking bar or any part of the premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquors."</quote>
Surely that is very vague. All that is sought in this Bill is to define more closely what parts of public-houses children may enter. I would point out that children</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>MARRIAGE LAW&#x2014;THE "NE TEMERE"<lb/>DECREE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00647"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> rose to call attention to the interference with the stability of the marriage tie caused by the conflict between the law of the United Kingdom and the Ordinances recently brought into force by the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, and to the steps which have been taken to enforce the latter; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00648">The noble Earl said: My Lords, it is with considerable regret that I have felt it my duty to place on the Paper of your Lordships' House a Notice criticising in any way the heads of any religious denomination. I should have hoped that we should have all done our best to live in amity with our religious neighbours, and that Motions criticising the action of any denomination towards another denomination might have been absent from discussion in Parliament. I do not think the most bitter partisan can deny that during the past few years the Protestants in this country have shown increasing readiness to live in amity with their neighbours. During only the past few years Parliament passed a law by which the British taxpayers provided the funds for a sectarian University in Dublin. Why, my Lords? Simply and solely in order to satisfy the consciences of their Roman Catholic fellow-subjects. Similarly last year your Lordships took your share in Parliament in passing the Royal Declaration Act&#x2014;an Act which was passed, I believe, almost entirely from the belief that it is undesirable
<col>166</col>
that there should be anything in any public document. offensive to any religious denomination.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00649">Have there been any very powerful steps taken on behalf of our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects to reciprocate the feelings winch we genuinely feel towards them? Speaking for Ireland, where I live, there has certainly of late years been a most satisfactory coming together of the various Protestant denominations in social matters, but I am sorry to say&#x2014;and I do not think the statement will be contradicted&#x2014;that our Roman Catholic friends continue to hold themselves aloof, working, obviously&#x2014;and I hope it will not annoy them when I say so&#x2014;towards what they seem to consider the ideal state of affairs which is best summed up in the expression, "Heads I win, tails you lose." This ambition is shown nowhere more clearly than in the recent ordinances promulgated not in Ireland only but in the British Isles, on the subject of marriage. They are contained in what is now known as the celebrated <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, which involves in these Islands an attempt at the enforcement of a marriage law which it has not been considered advisable to attempt to enforce for 350 years; and, as I think I shall be able to show before I sit down, this is only a part of a policy to enforce with greater strictness in these Islands portions of the canon law referring to the question of marriage which have been in force in these Islands for years past but have not been enforced as strictly as it is now desired to enforce them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00650">I wish to say, frankly and at once, that I should be the last person to maintain
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0109"/>
<col>167</col>
that any denomination had not the right to make ordinances or orders, or whatever you like to call them, for the conduct of the members of their particular profession. Every denomination would claim that right. I should certainly claim it for my own denomination, the Church of Ireland. But, my Lords, the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree goes a great deal further than that. It cannot be maintained, or at any rate proved, for an instant that the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree is purely a domestic matter. I know that this decree is published under the claim of the Roman Catholic Church to legislate for their own people. They have a perfect right to legislate for their own people. I should regret it extremely if any denomination legislated for their own people in opposition to the law of the land, but I do not think I should complain here in Parliament. I should regard it more as a domestic matter. But if a denomination legislated for its own subjects alone, but still contrary to the law of the land, I should regret it, and I should certainly expect the Executive to do three things. I should expect the Executive to see that no man or woman was deprived of his or her civil rights under the civil law; I should expect the Executive to see that public decency was not outraged; and I should expect the Executive to see that the subjects of no other denominations were affected, even indirectly, by the legislation of that particular church. If a religious denomination objects to the civil law, or to any part of it, the only honourable course for that denomination to follow is to come to Parliament and persuade Parliament to alter the civil law. It is not straightforward to attempt to get an alteration in the civil law by indirect means. But this evidently is not the view of the high Roman Catholic authorities, and this <i>Ne Temere</i> decree is an attempt to alter the marriage law of the country without coming to the only authority that has a right to alter the marriage law of the country as affecting the various denominations&#x2014;namely, your Lordships' House and the House of Commons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00651">I said just now that it is claimed by our Roman Catholic friends that the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree is a purely domestic arrangement affecting only Roman Catholics. I have the decree here, but I am not going to trouble your Lordships by reading it. The most cursory perusal of it, however, will prove conclusively that not only is
<col>168</col>
its whole effect to go outside the Roman Catholic denomination and affect other denominations, but it must have been drawn with that object and with that object alone. I need not trouble your Lordships with the history of the decree. A convenient starting point in its history is the Assembly of the Council of Trent, which met originally in the year 1543 and held a number of sessions, and which at one of its sessions declared all marriages null and void unless contracted in the presence of the parish priest., or some one deputed by him, and two or three other witnesses. This teaching was reaffirmed in the year 1864 in the <i>Syllabus Errorum,</i> the document which called forth Mr. Gladstone's two celebrated pamphlets, in which he declared the state of affairs set up in that document as dangerous to the morals of society, to the structure of the family, and to the peace of life. But, be it noticed, these decrees of the Council of Trent have been very seldom, if at all, applied in Protestant countries, although they have always been the law of the Roman Catholic Church. I only mention this in order to point out that the policy embodied in the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree is not a new law. It is rather the application of an old law to new countries, and amongst those countries we count the whole of the British Isles.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00652">It is not necessary, I think, for me to quote the actual words of the decree. I am saved the trouble of doing that by the fact that when the decree was published in the Archdiocese of Dublin, Archbishop Walsh wrote a long covering letter which he ordered to he read in all the Roman Catholic Churches at the same time as the decree. I think that two paragraphs in that letter roughly tell the whole story. Here is the first&#x2014;
<quote>"Hitherto in Ireland, by virtue of a rescript granted by Pope Pius VI in 1785, if a Catholic contracted a mixed marriage <i>clandestinely</i>&#x2014;that is to say, in the presence of a priest not authorised for the purpose, or a minister of another religion, or of a merely civil official or without any witnesses&#x2014;the marriage, grievously sinful as it would have been, would nevertheless have been a valid marriage constituting the contracting parties husband and wife."</quote>
The second paragraph which I shall quote&#x2014;it appears later in the letter&#x2014;runs:
<quote>"All this, however, is now at an end. Henceforth in Ireland, as generally throughout the Church&#x2014;</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0110"/>
<col>169</col>
I will allude to a notable exception before I sit down&#x2014;
<quote>"no mixed marriage can be validly contracted except in the presence of the parish priest and two witnesses."</quote>
I do not wish to go into the reasons why the Roman Catholic Church found it necessary to bring this into force; I need only say that whilst the Roman Catholic Church does very often allow mixed marriages, on terms, it is, of course, obviously to their interests that when those terms are settled they should be settled by the priest of their own church and not by the minister of any other.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00653">That decree came into force here at Easter, 1908. As we have been told in some of the correspondence outside your Lordships' House that our protest is a little belated. I would mention that the General Synod of the Church of Ireland met within a fortnight of the publishing of the decree and protested against it, owing to its being fraught with danger to uninstructed Protestants. Experience has proved that that fear was amply justified, but, as usual, it needed a specific case to really call the public mind to this matter. The general publishing of the decree I do not think resulted in very much notice being taken. The case which has drawn the public mind and attention to this matter is what is known as the Belfast Marriage Case&#x2014;the McCann case&#x2014;a case in which a husband has deserted his wife, has taken away his children. has shut up his wife's house, sold all her belongings as well as his own, and. disappeared. The McCann case is by no means an isolated case. We know of a case in Edinburgh. I noticed that my friend the right rev. the Primate of Ireland has told us that of his own knowledge he knew of two other cases. In a letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> on January 31 Mr. Herbert Pym spoke of another; and in London at this moment there is a man awaiting trial for bigamy. I do not wish to go into this case because it is <i>sub judice,</i> but the man is accused of having married a Roman Catholic wife having previously married a Protestant wife in the presence of a Protestant clergyman. But the McCann case is the most important of the cases that have come before us up to the present&#x2014;cases which, I am afraid, are only the first crop of what will probably be a greater number; and as this case has caused a great deal of public interest, it is
<col>170</col>
I obvious that it must be referred to in the course of a debate such as this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00654">I do not desire to go into the McCann case in detail myself, though I have plenty of material here with which to answer the defence that has been given by our Roman Catholic friends in another place, consisting as it did largely of gross attacks upon the personal character of the unhappy woman in the case. I am sorry to have to say it, but nobody has ever fallen foul of the high authorities of the Roman Catholic, Church without having his or her character instantly blackened, and this case has been no exception to the rule. My noble friend Lord Londonderry is in his place. He has recently been in Belfast, where interest in this case is very great indeed. I believe he intends to take part in this debate, and I therefore gladly say nothing about the case myself as I feel that the answer to what has been said in the House of Commons in defence of the action of the Roman Catholic authorities will come with much greater force from him than from me.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00655">My Lords, I ask leave to touch on only two points, and then to refer for a moment to the case as far as it affects the general question. A fresh defence of the other side of the case was published only a couple of days ago for English consumption in the pages of <i>Reynolds Newspaper,</i> which I believe is one of the official organs of the Party opposite, by Mfr. John Redmond. This article, I think, appeared on Sunday. It also appeared in the Belfast papers last Friday, but they stated that they had been supplied with advance copies. In this article Mr. Redmond says&#x2014;
<quote>"The facts of the case have not yet been established. We have an <i>ex parte</i> statement made on behalf of the wife. We have another <i>ex parte</i> statement of the husband contradicting the statement made by the wife."</quote>
And then Mr. Redmond goes on to draw, as naturally he would from his point of view, the obvious conclusion. I ask your Lordships to keep that point very strongly in your mind. You have an <i>ex parte</i> statement by the wife and an <i>ex parte</i> statement by the husband. Whom are you going to believe? Regarding the statements as unsupported&#x2014;and the wife's statement is not unsupported&#x2014;but regarding them as unsupported, you have a wife who is anxious to take her place in a Court of law and to prove her right to her full rights, and you have a husband who has fled from justice, who is in hiding, and who,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0111"/>
<col>171</col>
in the words of Father Power, a well-known Jesuit, written in one of the Scottish papers, is&#x2014;
<quote>"far out of the range of the Ulster guns, and is not going to be extradited."</quote>
Which is the most credible? The veracity of the woman, the wife, anxious to prove her rights before all, or the veracity of the coward who dare not face the music? I am content to let those two witnesses be judged against each other by your Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00656">In the article to which I have referred Mr. Redmond, I will not say sneers at its, but at any rate makes the point that the whole of the agitation, the very considerable agitation, that is taking place and is growing on this subject, was only trumped up when we knew that a General Election was coming. It was trumped up on December 3, he says, just before the polling in Mr. Devlin's constituency in West Belfast. The facts are that this agitation really first attracted the public eye on November 13 owing to the preaching of a sermon by Mr. Corkey, the Presbyterian minister very largely concerned in this case&#x2014;November 13, which, as your Lordships know, was two days before any one suspected that the General Election was coining. The noble Earl opposite made the announcement of the General Election in your Lordships' House a day or two later; but we had the official announcement of the General Election on November 15, in a letter which the Home Secretary wrote to a prominent supporter in Dundee. If the agitation, therefore, can fairly be said to have started, as I think it can be said to have started, by Mr. Corkey's sermon on November 13, when nobody outside the Cabinet knew that a General Election was coming, I think that is a sufficient answer to Mr. Redmond's charge that this agitation, which has been carried on by many men who have never been on a political platform in their lives, has really been raised for political purposes. But the real answer&#x2014;and this is my reason for referring to this point&#x2014;appears in the Dublin papers of yesterday, in Cardinal Logue's Lenten Pastoral, where he speaks of the agitation as&#x2014;
<quote>"having been got up avowedly for the purpose of moving the civil authorities to fetter the action of the Church and block the execution of her laws."</quote>
I do not know that I should have put it in exactly the same words as His Eminence,
<col>172</col>
but at any rate there is no sign of the expression "political agitation" in that statement by the Cardinal, and I commend it to the notice of our Roman Catholic friends who are raising this political agitation cry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00657">That is all I desire to say with regard to the McCann case except so far as regards its bearing on the general question. The main facts of the case are these. Mr. and Mrs. McCann were married in a Presbyterian church in County Antrim in May, 1908. Their first child was born in June, 1909, and the second child in August, 1910. What is the claim of the Roman Catholic Church? The claim of the Roman Catholic Church is that because McCann was a Roman Catholic this marriage is null and void. There is no doubt whatever about the claim. The last number&#x2014;and we are sorry to understand that it is the last number&#x2014;of a publication which we have many of us read with much interest in Ireland, the <i>New Ireland Review,</i> contained an article by Father Finlay, the well-known Jesuit and a great educational expert. In that article Father Finlay lays clown clearly that&#x2014;
<quote>"The marriage ceremony in the Presbyterian Church was wholly invalid. McCann was conscientiously bound to separate from the Presbyterian woman unless she consented to a revalidation of the marriage, and he is under the gravest obligation to see that his children are baptized and brought up Catholics."</quote>
The marriage was wholly invalid, and McCann was conscientiously bound to separate from the Presbyterian woman That is the claim of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00658">Oh, but we are told that no member of the Roman Catholic Church can be charged with active action in this case. The wife's story is that a priest came and caused all the trouble. Show us the priest, we are asked. We do not know the priest. The woman does not know the name of the priest. But I pay my tribute to the ingenuity of the answer given in another place by Mr. Devlin. He produced statements by three priests, who all said they had not done what Mrs. McCann said had been done. Possibly none of those three men did. But there are 3,000 priests in Ireland, and unless you can produce a testimony from every one of the 3,000 you cannot prove the negative that some priest did not have to do with it. But, on the other hand, we have a state-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0112"/>
<col>173</col>
ment from another leading Jesuit saying definitely that a priest did have to do with it. On January 14, in the <i>Scotsman,</i> Father Power makes no doubt whatever about this matter. Towards the end of his letter he says&#x2014;
<quote>"The priest has done Ins duty as part administrator, not of the civil, but of the sacred law of matrimony "</quote>
The priest has done his duty&#x0021; What was that duty? Father Power tells us earlier in the letter. He tells us what the Jewish Rabbis do in similar cases where there is a conflict between the law of the land and the law of Israel. In such a case they declare the marriage to be null and void. Then Father Power goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"The authorised exponents of the <i>Ne Temere</i> law said the same thing to Mr. and Mrs. McCann."</quote>
Does that prove that a priest had to do with it, or the contrary Then Father Power goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"Sometimes the Rabbis and the Catholic priests are heeded and sometimes not. Over and over again I have made the same representations to couples similarly circumstanced. I was always listened to&#x2014;"</quote>
then follows a sneer at some of the speakers at the Belfast meeting which I need not quote&#x2014;
<quote>"but my advice was not always taken. I. had done my duty and bowed myself out, not to return to the charge till next time."</quote>
We ought to be grateful to Father Power for his frankness. He describes quite definitely what the high Roman Catholic authorities did in this ease, what they always do in similar cases, and what they intend to do in future cases. I commend that letter from Father Power, which was published in the <i>Scotsman</i> on January 14 last, to our friends the defenders of the action taken in this miserable case in Belfast.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00659">But, apart altogether from the particular case, look at the circumstances. A man and a woman are married in a place of worship in the presence of a Protestant clergyman, or a Presbyterian clergyman, or whatever you will, but that clergyman is, apart from his ministry, a recognised State official for the purpose. He has the same recognition for the purpose that a Roman Catholic priest has&#x2014;no more and no less. Two things are done. There is the public plighting of the troth before the congregation and afterwards the signing of the register&#x2014;a register specially provided by the State for the purpose, a copy of
<col>174</col>
which, of course, must be sent to the proper official within a certain time. The contract is duly witnessed by the clergyman, who may be an Archbishop or a Bishop. and it is also witnessed by the friends of the parties, who may be of any rank from a Prime Minister downwards. Is that a legal marriage or is it not? Unquestionably, say all the Protestant denominations. Unquestionably, say the Roman Catholic Church if both parties are Protestants, but if one of the parties is a Roman Catholic that marriage is null and void. Why? Because the Roman Catholic Church say so, and for no other reason. The Pope has decreed that on and after Easter Sunday, 1908, that the marriage is an illegal marriage if one of the parties belongs to our denomination, and the Roman Catholic- is bound conscientiously to separate from such a union.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00660">The worst side of the whole thing is the keen support that the Roman Catholic authorities give to their followers in this matter. I notice that my friend Lord Edmund Talbot, in another place, was good enough to say that he had no doubt that when the facts were established it would be found that at any rate the ecclesiastical authorities of his Church had no share in the gross and brutal conduct of this man. I am grateful to him for the use of the words "gross and brutal" conduct, although it is difficult to understand how the conduct was gross and brutal if his marriage to the woman was invalid. But surely Lord Edmund Talbot, is answered by Father Finlay and by Father Power. According to them the marriage was invalid, and the man was bound to treat his wife as he did. That claim is a most outrageous one upon the liberties of this country as enjoyed for centuries, and we are bound on every possible occasion to make our strongest possible protest against it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00661">Will your Lordships allow me to refer to one other point? I said just now that I believed that the publishing of this <i>Ne Temere</i> decree in these islands is part and parcel of a settled policy to stiffen up, if I may use the phrase with all respect, the enforcement of the marriage laws of the Roman Catholic Church, whether they are concerned with mixed marriages or any other part of the canon law. Late last night an account of a most astounding case&#x2014;it is two years old, but I had not heard of it before&#x2014;was placed in my hand,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0113"/>
<col>175</col>
which certainly lends colour to the view I have advanced. It is the case of a trial in Wexford for bigamy, reported in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> on July 5 last, and there was no doubt whatever about the facts. Two first cousins were married in the year 1892. It was a perfectly legal marriage by the law of the land, but an illegal marriage by the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church. The couple were married for sixteen years, and finally&#x2014;this was proved up to the hilt, and I have the letters here and the final judgment of the Lord Chief Justice who tried the case&#x2014;with the advice of their Bishop, they each married somebody else and were tried for bigamy. I will read the Lord Chief Justice's remarks in finishing the case. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"No moral blame attached to the parties, having regard to the advice of the Bishop. Although they were guilty in point of law, he would discharge them without inflicting any punishment."</quote>
I am not attacking the decision of the Lord Chief Justice. I have no doubt that his decision as to what to do in giving sentence, acting with all the facts before him, was perfectly right, for he is one of the most able and courageous men who ever sat on the Irish Bench. But surely it is time that some protest was made against the working of a system which after sixteen or seventeen years of married life enables subjects of His Majesty, with the advice of their Bishop, to marry again, just as if there had never been any marriage at all in the original case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00662">What is the position in which we find ourselves? Surely this is a case calling for action by the Government. I do not suppose that the keenest friends of the Government would maintain that they showed any very great energy in dealing with the McCann case. The Lord-Lieutenant, I have no doubt on Mr. Birrell's advice, refused to take any action last December. Why? Because the children, he understood, were in the father's keeping. Your Lordships, I am sure, will appreciate what would be the humour of the position if it were not so tragic. The father has deserted his wife because his marriage is invalid, but the children must be secured to him because his marriage is legal. I cannot imagine a more ridiculous position, or a more ridiculous decision. I sympathise with Mr. Birrell for having had to give it. But we understand now, from the debate that occurred in another place, that Mrs
<col>176</col>
McCann is to receive the assistance of the police in finding her husband, although he is "out of the range of the Ulster guns," and in finding her children. I hope that some representative of His Majesty's Government on the Front Bench will be able to tell us that that search is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00663">I have put down a Motion for Papers. I am quite certain that there must be a shoal of papers dealing with this subject, and I think we should see some of them. I notice in <i>Hansard</i> that on February 7 my friend Mr. Moore asked the Chief Secretary in another place whether he would write to the Bishop of Belfast to find out whether these children are in any school or institution in his diocese, and Mr. Birrell said he would do so. I should like to know whether any answer has been received to that letter. If the answer was favourable so much the better. If it was not favourable, I should like to know what further steps His Majesty's Government have taken. But, apart from this particular case, surely the whole matter is one calling for Government action. Surely the time has come when the Government might approach the high ecclesiastical authorities of the Roman Catholic Church in order to put an end to a state of things which is a scandal and is bound to remain a scandal. There is a ray of hope. The Roman Catholic authorities have made the first advance&#x2014;at least I think they have made the first advance. In Mr. Redmond's article to which I have already referred I notice that he quotes an extract from this month's issue of the <i>Irish Ecclesiastical Record,</i> which says on this mixed marriage question
<quote>"If it can be shown that the new law of the Church inflicts any serious grievance on Protestants&#x2014;"</quote>
and I think we can show that is the case in this country&#x2014;
<quote>"we are satisfied that due consideration will be given to any representations that may be made on that head."</quote>
I should have paid no attention whatever to that paragraph if Mr. Redmond had not, metaphorically, given it his blessing. It is the first ray of hope. It is an invitation to the Government to do something, and I hope they will not neglect the opportunity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00664">At this moment the decree is not in force throughout the whole of the German
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0114"/>
<col>177</col>
Empire. Surely what is good enough for Germany is not too good for us. The parallel is encouraging. We all know that the German Government depends largely for its stability upon the support it receives from the Centre Party&#x2014;the Roman Catholic party. We also know&#x2014;and I hope I shall not annoy noble Lords opposite by saying so&#x2014;that this Government very largely depends for its stability on the support it receives in the House of Commons from the Roman Catholic party. It would not, I think, be derogatory for His Majesty's Government to take a leaf out of the German Government's book, and approach the high ecclesiastical authorities of the Roman Catholic. Church in this matter. It really is not a great outrage on their feelings that we ask the Roman Catholic Church to permit. We ask them to restore a system which, after all. they tolerated in this country until Easter, 1908. They tolerate it still in Germany. It cannot be so desperately immoral that they cannot go on tolerating it here. I am encouraged by a letter I saw this afternoon on a kindred, though not a similar subject. Your Lordships are probably aware that there is some trouble going on in South Africa between the high authorities of the Roman Catholic Church and the Government there on the subject of the marriage laws. I noticed a letter that had been written by the Roman Catholic vicar apostolic of Kimberley, in which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"It ought to be enough for the State to be satisfied that a marriage has been contracted according to the formula of any recognised religious body, and to afford it formal sanction."</quote>
Is it unfair to paraphrase that, and to say that it ought to be enough for the high Roman Catholic authorities to be satisfied that a marriage has been contracted according to the formula of any recognised religious body?</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00665">Cannot we come to some agreement between all the denominations on this matter? Surely it ought to be done. Then let all the denominations agree to discourage mixed marriages. We know that the Roman Catholic Church dislikes mixed marriages. So do 1. So do all denominations. Let us discourage them all we can; but surely discouragement is the proper way to deal with them, and not tyranny. At present one cannot shut one's eyes to the position of affairs. The person who chiefly benefits&#x2014;I am quite certain the Roman Catholic Church
<col>178</col>
never desired that he should&#x2014;the person who chiefly benefits is a RomanCatholic who would be seducer, who can now encourage a Protestant woman to marry him according to the form that he knows she would prefer, that is, in her own church, with the sure knowledge that he can&#x2014;indeed that he must&#x2014;subsequently repudiate that marriage under the orders of the authorities of his own church. Surely that is a wrong state of affairs. I am perfectly certain that the idea of making such a thing possible never entered the heads of the high authorities who have introduced this <i>Ne Temere</i> decree into this country. But it is one of the results of it, and it might be the most serious result. The matter does, I think, most urgently call for the attention of His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00666"><i>Moved,</i> That there be laid before the House Papers respecting the interference with the stability of the marriage tie caused by the conflict between the law of the United Kingdom and the Ordinances recently brought into force by the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church,&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Donoughmore.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00667"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in replying to the noble Earl, I will take the various points with which he dealt more or less consecutively, and I hope to mollify, at all events partially, his statement with regard to the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree. As Lord Donoughmore said, this decree had not been active in the United Kingdom for a great number of years, and only became effective here in the year 1907. When it did become active here the Registrar-General for England approached Archbishop Bourne, and pointed out that the declaration, in his opinion, might lead to certain difficulties. A note was published in the <i>Tablet</i> which, I think, is important in that respect, and if your Lordships will permit me I will quote the two sections which deal with this question. Archbishop Bourne said, speaking of the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, that it only referred to the canonical nullity or validity of marriages&#x2014;that was to say, in the judgment of the Church and in the sight of God. He added&#x2014;
<quote>"The Catholic Church, though she does not acknowledge that the State has any right to determine what marriages shall be null or valid, has no power&#x2014;"</quote>
and these are important words&#x2014;
<quote>"to change the civil law of marriage."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0115"/>
<col>179</col>
The noble Earl will be the first to acknowledge&#x2014;he said so in his opening remarks&#x2014;that it would be a difficult thing to attempt to alter any particular tenets of any particular Church. If you attempted it you would be steering very near the question of interference with religious liberty. The civil law of the realm allows marriage with a deceased wife's sister, but there are a great many churchmen who very strongly object to that decree although it is the law of the land. Perhaps the noble Earl will permit me to refer to a speech which he delivered on Saturday, with several points of which I am in entire agreement. The noble Earl said the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree&#x2014;
<quote>"went far beyond the rights that. any Church bad ever claimed to possess, but if it concerned Roman Catholics alone objection to it might be minimised."</quote>
I do not quite understand how you can minimise it in one case and not in the other. Neither do I understand how you are going to maintain a civil objection to a certain tenet of a religious denomination. You may say you dislike it, but I do not see that any dislike on your part will prevent people from holding certain tenets of belief. The noble Earl went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"No one desires to encourage mixed marriages."</quote>
I quite agree with the noble Earl, but as long as human nature is human nature I do not see that any discouragement will absolutely stop mixed marriages, and it is precisely on the question of mixed marriage that we come into conflict with the various religious denominations. The only laws which the people in this country recognise, said the noble Earl, were those made at Westminster&#x2014;not those made in Rome. I think every one in this House will agree with that. Archbishop Bourne has said frankly that no law made by the Roman Catholic Church could interfere at all with the civil law of the land. The noble Earl passed on to the McCann case. I think everybody will allow that that case is not pleasant reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00668"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: What was the date of the statement in the <i>Tablet?</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00669"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: It appeared, I think, in the summer of 1907&#x2014;I cannot give the noble and learned Lord the actual date. The Government is not concerned to defend this decree of <i>Ne Temere;</i> it is a domestic regulation of the Roman Catholic Church, declaring, <i>inter alia,</i> the laws under which marriages are valid in
<col>180</col>
the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church. Marriages between Roman Catholics and persons of different denominations can only be valid in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church if the persons are married according to the regulations which have come into force in this <i>Ne Temere</i> decree. But there is reason to doubt whether rather more is not made of the actual decree as regards the validity of the marriage than the decree has called for. The noble Earl stated that in the debate which took place in the House of Commons a fortnight ago Mrs. McCann's character was a good deal blackened. I have read the whole of the debate, and, raking it all through, I confess that. there did not appear any particular wish to blacken Mrs. McCann's character. I think the general desire throughout was to hear both sides of the case. Though Mr. Devlin quoted an extract from the husband's statement of the affair I do not think he in any way desired to blacken the character of Mrs. McCann, even though he may not have agreed with the statements which she made. Until one can hear both sides it is a little hard for the noble Earl to say that during the debate Mrs. McCann's character was vilified or blackened. The noble Earl put the question as to whose word could be most believed&#x2014;that of the husband, or that of the wife. At first sight I can only say that personally I thoroughly agree with what the noble Earl said as to the man being a mean sneak in going off as he did. but I do not think one can put the whole blame upon his shoulders before he has been heard. He has not been heard in a Court of law.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl stated that there was no political point in this matter at all, that the agitation was not at all political. I do not wish to touch upon this, as the matter was gone into fully in the House of Commons, but I was glad to hear the noble Earl disavow
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0116"/>
<col>181</col>
any political intention in the case. The fact, however, remains that at a special meeting of the Presbytery of Belfast on December 2, on the eve of the General Election, two of the clergymen there expressed the opinion that the McCann case had been brought about by Divine Providence in order to enlighten the people of Great Britain. I am very glad that the noble Earl disavows that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00674"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHINTORE</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble Earl does not wish to misrepresent me. I quoted the accusation which is made&#x2014;that it was the sole or primary object in raising the case. I do not think I put it furl her than that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00675"><member>THE EARL, OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree. I have not seen the cutting to which the noble Earl referred containing Father Power's statement that a Roman Catholic priest had visited Mrs. McCann. I do not see that there is any reason to disbelieve the parish priests and their curates in the parish in which Mrs. McCann resided, who all deny having brought personal influence to bear in the case; but, as the noble Earl said, you can get people from anywhere and. it is difficult to say that no priest visited Mrs. McCann. but to the best of our knowledge that was the case. Reference was made by the noble Earl to the promise which Mr. Birrell gave to Mr. Moore in the House of Commons to the effect that he would write to the Roman Catholic Bishop of the diocese and ask whether these children were in any school or institution in his diocese. A letter to that effect was sent to the Bishop, who replied in the negative. I can only say that everything that is possible to be done in this case is being done. It would, however, have been impossible to have stepped in in the first case, and it would also have been impossible to have taken the children from their father. The police could not step in until a summons had been taken out by Mrs. McCann against her husband for desertion and consequently to obtain alimony, and so long as the husband had not committed a criminal offence he is by law entitled to the custody of the children. I am afraid I shall not convince the noble Earl on that point, but I am given to understand that that is the law on the matter. I have nothing further to say, except that I think the case has been somewhat overstated as regards the power of the <i>Ne Tonere</i> decree with relation to
<col>182</col>
the alteration of the marriage laws. The Roman Catholics are, perhaps, more emphatic in their declarations than other denominations, but so long as the civil law of the land remains no decree from any religious denomination can nullify or invalidate a civil marriage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00676"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOCNT LLANDAFF</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust your Lordships will extend your indulgence to me if I trespass on your attention for a few minutes. I do not propose to go into the facts of the McCann case. I will accept all that the noble Earl who brought, forward this Motion said about the husband, about-his desertion of his wife, about his improper and cruel treatment of her by removing her young children from her care. I accept all that. All I wish to bring before the House is the colour which the noble Earl put on the whole of this case, as indicating some deep design on the part of the authorities of the Church of Rome to impose their canon law on this country as against; the civil law of the land. I believe that to be an entirely mistaken view of the facts.<lb/>
The noble Earl said, quite truly, that the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree was merely a reaffirmation of the decree of the Council of Trent of the Sixteenth Century. You cannot understand the merits and the motives of the decree of the Council of Trent unless you recall what was the state of the marriage law of Europe at that time. For centuries before the Council of Trent sat the whole of Christian. Europe had accepted as law that a legal as well as a sacramental marriage was constituted merely by the free interchange of words of present consent by the two parties, without the presence of a priest, without the presence of any State official, and without the need of any witnesses except for the purpose of evidence. That was a state of things that led to infinite disorders and mischief. I need not go into instances. In the first place, there was no record of those marriages; in the second place, there was the temptation to young persons to disregard the desires of parents. Scotland, as far as I know, is the only civilised country in which what I may call the old common law of marriage still prevails, and in which an interchange by present words of consent still constitute a legal as well as a religious marriage. All other countries have by degrees introduced various modifications
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0117"/>
<col>183</col>
in what they require for the validity of the contract of marriage: publicity, either in the shape of banns or in some other way, in order to discover hidden impediments that might hereafter render the marriage void; celebration in the presence of an official, either clerical or lay; and clue record of the marriage in some official register.<lb/>
These things have been done by various stages in Europe. What was the Church to do? The Church is concerned only with the sacrament. In the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church marriage is a sacrament. She deals with it in that aspect, and in that aspect alone. She has nothing to do with the legal rights that arise from it, or that the State may choose to attach. She deals with marriage solely as a sacrament, and it was legitimate for her to safeguard the sacrament of marriage in the same way as the State safeguarded the civil contract of marriage. The course adopted by the decree of the Council of Trent was not to alter the form of the sacrament, but to require that the parties, who were members of her Communion, should be married in the presence of two witnesses and that of the parish priest of one of the parties. I do not know who else could have been chosen by the Church of Rome as the official witness and the official minister of the sacrament of marriage than the parish priest. He alone could properly inquire into the canonical impediments that might exist to the marriage; he alone could know the duties of the parties in respect to each other, and in respect to their parents, if any.<lb/>
My Lords, did the Church of Rome attempt to override the civil law under the decree of the Council of Trent? Nothing of the kind. The decree of the Council of Trent applied to Catholics only; non-Catholics were not affected in any degree by its canon. It had no effect until it was promulgated, and, even after it had been promulgated, in certain districts if the country was overwhelmingly non-Catholic in character the decree of the Council of Trent did not bind even its Catholic subjects. An historial instance of that will be present to the minds of most of your Lordships&#x2014;I mean the case of the marriage of Jerome Bonaparte. Pius VI was called upon by the master of many legions to declare the marriage void. It had been celebrated not in accord-
<col>184</col>
ance with the decree of Trent, in America, and Pius VII refused to declare that marriage void. The noble Earl referred to what Pius VI had done in 1795&#x2014;not 1895, as he said. Pius VI issued a rescript of propaganda that the decrees of the Council of Trent did not apply to mixed marriages celebrated in that country not according to the decree of the Council of Trent. That certainly was not attempting to impose the decree where the laws differed. In England up to the reign of William IV Catholics could not legally be married except by a clergyman of the Church of England, who had to publish the banns, celebrate the marriage, enter it in his register, and keep the record of it. What was the action of the Church of Rome? In order to facilitate as far as possible harmony between the canon law and the law of the land the Church of Rome during all those years never promulgated the decree of the Council of Trent in this country. The consequence was that while Catholics received the privilege and benefit. of a legal marriage by the action of a clergyman of the Church of England, they also received the privilege and benefit of a sacramental marriage by the interchange of consent, all that was required by the canon laws before the decree of the Council of Trent was published. That was an honest endeavour to bring the law of the land and the canon law into harmony by enabling the same ceremony to satisfy both.<lb/>
What is the state of things at present in Ireland? Since the Marriage Acts of William IV great advances have been made, as the noble Earl very truly said, to conciliate and meet the wishes of different denominations in this country. At the time the decree was issued a marriage by a priest in the Catholic Church was a legal marriage, and it was intended to be the law for Catholics. It was for Catholics that the change in the law was introduced with regard to this marriage by a priest in a Catholic church. What is the effect of the decree <i>Ne Temere?</i> The whole effect of the decree is that if you choose to step beyond what the canon law allows you to do, if you choose to go and be married in a Presbyterian Chapel or in a Church of England church not according to the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, you will have a legal marriage without doubt; all the legal rights that flow from the marriage ceremony will follow; but you will not
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0118"/>
<col>185</col>
receive the sacrament, and, moreover, you will be disobedient to the law and the direction of your own Church. I fail to see how it can be pretended that that is forcing canon law on the law of the land when all that the decree of <i>Ne Temere</i> does is to prescribe for Catholic subjects, and none others. All non-Catholics are specially excepted.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl read passages from a letter by Father Power and somebody else speaking of these marriages as null and void. Father Power was referring to the sacramental marriage, which is the only thing that concerns him. He is not so silly as to suppose that the marriage is legally invalid. No human being in his sane senses ever contended such a thing as that. The legality of the marriage, the rights of the wife, are all untouched and unaltered. What Father Power, and everybody else who has written in the same sense; means is that the sacramental marriage has not taken place. That is the only marriage with which the Church is concerned; that is the only marriage about which she interests herself; and if Father Power is silly enough to suppose that Mrs. McCann is not entitled to the rights of a wife just the same as every other wife in the kingdom I feel sorry for Father Power. That cannot be his meaning. Indeed, so far as I could catch what the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite said, it is explained in the sense that the invalidity meant is the invalidity of the sacramental marriage and not the in-validity of the legal marriage. What has the Church to say to one of her subjects who has chosen to disregard her commands and contract an insufficient marriage, although he has contracted a marriage which is sufficient according to the law but insufficient as a sacramental marriage? She says to him, "You can remedy this if you please. You are legally a husband, but you have not received the sacrament. You are, therefore, living in a state of sin. In that sense your marriage is void and illegal. It is void in the eyes of conscience, though not in the eyes of the law. The remedy is that you should be married again in the way that the law allows you, by a priest in the Catholic Church." His wife will not do that. She is an obstinate Presbyterian, like Mrs. McCann, and refuses to be married again in accordance with the Church. It then comes to what Lord Edmund Talbot said in another place,
<col>186</col>
and I find that it is so on ample authority. It is then the priest's duty to report to his Bishop the state of things, and the Bishop either by a general authority or a special authority granted to him by the Holy See, may ratify the marriage and declare it valid as from the date that he believes both parties concurred in consenting to the matrimonial union. To read that as an attempt to set the canon law above the law of the land seems to me a most extravagant conclusion to draw.<lb/>
What the Church by the <i>Ne Tonere</i> decree has enjoined is simply a choice of one of the several legal modes of contracting marriage that the law affords, such mode being satisfactory to the conscience of her own subjects and members. She certainly does her utmost to provide means for remedying anything spiritually wrong although not legally wrong in the marriage, and cases of that sort occur on many other occasions besides marriage. Take, for example, the case of a bequest to a legatee with no legal trust expressed, but with the knowledge of the legatee that the money was left to him to be devoted to some particular purpose, and, in spite of that knowledge, he keeps the money in his own pocket. In a case of that kind he is legally justified, but he is morally wrong. In the same manner Mr. McCann was a perfectly legal husband, but he was in a state of sin because of his disregarding the legal means at his command and at his disposal. Allusion has been made to the difficulties which arise in all countries when the law of the Church and the law of the land conflict. The Church of England herself has had recent experience of that. I can only say that it seems to me that the best way of dealing with those unhappy differences which do and must arise in course of time is to do as the Church of Rome has done in this case&#x2014;namely, to recognise to the full the legal effects of the Acts which are against the law of the Church and to treat the offence only as a moral one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00677"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I might detain the House for a few moments it appears to me that a reference to a few facts would tend to clear up the discussion which has taken place on this very interesting question. The noble Viscount, who has done so much to clear the question up, has not completely exhausted the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0119"/>
<col>187</col>
question, because the real difficulty at the present time is why the decree of the Council of Trent should be promulgated now with regard to England and Ireland. The difficulty really arises in consequence of the promulgation of the decree. The decree of the Council of Trent, in point of fact, as the noble Viscount has said, was simply legislation in order to prevent the abuses arising from clandestine marriages, It was not in its object different from Lord Hardwicke's Act with regard to England for the purpose of preventing clandestine marriages and was a step towards remedying other abuses, as the noble Viscount has said, which attached to the then marriage law. For all practical purposes the object of Lord Hardwicke's Act and the object of the decree of the Council of Trent were very much the same.<lb/>
But, my Lords, the real point at the present time is why the decree of the Council of Trent should have been promulgated in England and Ireland, affecting, as it does, in an injurious way, any country where mixed marriages are likely to prevail. The decree of the Council of Trent was for the purpose of preventing girls being deceived with regard to marriage, and stopping the kind of abuses which the noble Viscount has mentioned; but it appears to me that the promulgation of the decree in England and Ireland under existing circumstances really leads back to the very mischiefs which it was the object of the decree to prevent. Where the ' decree has been promulgated, it is quite possible, as Lord Donoughmore has said, for a man to go through a form of marriage with a girl which she conceives to be perfectly valid, which may be legal, but which he at the same time knows is not binding on his own conscience. That is the result of the promulgation of the decree of the Council of Trent in a country like England, where Roman Catholics are in the minority, and the question one would like to have answered is, Why, if the decree of the Council of Trent has not been promulgated in Germany, it should be promulgated in England? That is the real question to which we should like an answer.<lb/>
In regard to a great deal that fell from Lord Donoughmore I am not in the least in agreement with him. Each religious community must enforce its own laws on its own people with regard to marriage; and if you talk of the anomalies of the law,
<col>188</col>
I should like to refer your Lordships to the anomalies of the marriage law with regard to members of the Church of England, which was only reported the other day in the papers, which is a <i>reductio ad absurdum,</i> with reference to what happens in the present state of our marriage law. A man died leaving so many hundreds a year to his widow on condition that she did not marry again. Some time after her husband's death the lady married her deceased sister's husband&#x2014;her brother-in-law. That was before the passing of the Deceased Wife's Sister Act. The executors of her husband's will went on paying her the jointure left her by her husband on the ground that, it being an illegal marriage, she was still a widow. When the Deceased Wife's Sister Act passed they stopped paying her jointure on the ground that, being legally married, she had ceased to be a widow. The lady brought an action against the executors to get her jointure still paid to her. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will correct me if I am stating the case incorrectly, but I believe the decision of the Law Courts was to the effect that, inasmuch as the Deceased Wife's Sister Act had expressly provided that the passing of the Act was not to affect in any way legal arrangements as to property previously made, the lady was entitled to her jointure&#x2014;that is to say, she was still a widow, While, owing to the Act, she was in fact a wife.<lb/>
I should like to impress upon His Majesty's Government that they should take the question of the marriage law into consideration and deal with it. We have one law for Scotland, another law for Ireland, and another law for England, and we have all the contradictions and difficulties which arise out of the extremely difficult and complicated law of domicile. The whole marriage law is in a state of complete confusion, and I would suggest to His Majesty's Government that they should take the whole matter into consideration with a view to doing what. I believe, in the circumstances would be the best thing&#x2014;I quite admit it is not ideal, but in cases of this sort you very often have to take the line of least difficulty&#x2014;that is, to insist upon a civil marriage in all cases. It is the case abroad, and it might well be insisted on in England. Since the Divorce Commission much has come out showing the advisability of enforcing a civil marriage on every one. The Government
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0120"/>
<col>189</col>
might then leave the Churches to enforce their own law in regard to marriage on their own members. We should then have an intelligible basis to act upon, and we should go a long way towards avoiding the extreme difficulties that do arise and are certain to arise between the Churches and the State as long as things remain as they are at present, and we should be doing something which, I am satisfied, would be extremely beneficial in the interests of the country generally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00678"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Donoughmore, in the course of his extremely clear speech, alluded to me as being so closely connected with the North of Ireland, and especially with Belfast, where feeling runs so high with regard to what is called the McCann case, that he virtually handed over to me the dealing with this part of this most important question. There is very strong feeling in Ireland, not only amongst Protestants but also amongst a large number of Catholics, against the principle which has been brought so prominently forward by this now famous case. Meetings have been held in Dublin, and I see by a leading North of Ireland organ yesterday that the Archbishops, Bishops, and clergy have solemnly warned their flocks of the dangers likely to ensue if this state of things is allowed to continue. From protracted experience 1 know that that is the case, and I offer no apology in rising to-night to deal, so far as I can, with this question.<lb/>
My noble friend very wisely divided this question into two parts&#x2014;the local question, if I may use that expression, which is raised in the cruelty and injustice dealt out to Mrs. McCann; and the principle which is involved, inasmuch as if this state of affairs is allowed to continue we cannot fail to recognise that the Papal decree is overriding the law of our land. I turn first of all to the question of Mrs. McCann. My noble friend behind me (Lord Donoughmore) very briefly epitomised the admirable speech of the late Unionist Attorney-General for Ireland, Mr. Campbell, when discussing this measure in the House of Commons recently on the occasion of the Debate on the Address. I will epitomise it still more shortly. A Protestant girl married a Catholic in the Presbyterian Church; they lived happily for some years; they had children born
<col>190</col>
to them, and then one sad day the priest appeared and told the woman that her marriage was not legal and that she was bound to be re-married. This woman, whom my noble friend on the Cross Benches, I think, called a stern unbending Protestant. to my mind rightly declined. Had she permitted herself to -be persuaded to take this course she would have been admitting that she had been living in sin for some years and that her children were bastards. and to my mind no right-thinking woman would countenance such a state of things. I listened very attentively to the noble and learned Viscount on the Cross Benches (Viscount Llandaff), who of course speaks with authority, and I confess it was strange to me to hear that a marriage was illegal unless the sacraments were given by the Church to those married people. But what I cannot understand is what would be the offspring of these two people, who, we think, are legally married, but who are not legally married according to the noble and learned Viscount. Are they or are they not legitimate? That is a question which I should like to have heard him explain at greater length. But this I do know from the statement of Mrs. McCann, that she was assured by the priest who visited her that her children were bastards, and, so far as our law goes, would naturally be bastards even if she had been foolish enough to comply with the dictates of that priest.<lb/>
I have deviated a little from what I was saying about the recent discussion of this question in the other House in order to deal with what had fallen from the noble and learned Viscount, who speaks with great authority on Roman Catholic matters. The statements so ably and fully made by Mr. Campbell in the House of. Commons were never controverted for one moment, and, sitting in the Gallery of the other House, I saw that the whole atmosphere of the House was in favour of that unfortunate woman who had suffered wrongs, wrongs that I am sure no woman, particularly a mother, could fail to resent. Mr. Devlin, the Nationalist Roman Catholic Member for West Belfast, at once put a different complexion on the situation. My noble friend behind me stated that Mr. Devlin, in order to prove his point, had blackened the character of Mrs. McCann, and I was extremely sorry to hear extenuating circumstances afterwards put forward. That Mr. Devlin did endeavour
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0121"/>
<col>191</col>
to blacken the character of Mrs. McCann no one who heard his speech could fail to recognise. Until that speech was made never had one word been suggested against the character of Mrs. McCann, not even by any of the priests themselves. Mr. Devlin read statements by certain priests from which he tried to prove that the life of the McCanns was an unhappy one. He said the police were frequently called in, and that Mrs. McCann left her husband. But he did more. He went on to read a letter from Mr. McCann to an unnamed&#x2014;although I cannot imagine to the Government unknown&#x2014;correspondent, complaining of the conduct of Mrs. McCann and of the way in which she treated him owing to his Roman Catholic views. From that letter it would appear that Mrs. McCann would put back the clock and so make him late for Mass, and that she would have meat ready for him on Fridays&#x2014;in fact, the gist of the letter was that his life was made a burden to him by Mrs. McCann because he was a Roman Catholic. Those are the extracts which Mr. Devlin read purporting to be from a letter written by Mr. McCann to a person whose name was not given.<lb/>
I consider it to be the duty of the Government to ascertain from Mr. Devlin the name of the recipient of this letter. Mr. Devlin must know the recipient, and the recipient must know where McCann is, and on the discovery of McCann's whereabouts Mrs. McCann could take the necessary steps to recover her legal rights. I therefore ask, Will the Government do that; or, if not, what steps will they take in order to discover where McCann is? As to the statement that the police were frequently called in to the McCanns', the police undoubtedly were called in on one occasion&#x2014;because the husband was very drunk. Mrs. McCann, who was in an interesting condition, had considered it her duty in the interests of herself and the unborn child to leave the house and go to her mother's, where she remained, and McCann the following day, having come to his senses, visited the house and begged her to come back. Mr. Devlin endeavoured to prove that their domestic life was extremely unhappy. I have a bundle of letters here written by Mr. McCann to his wife. I will not weary your Lordships with them all, but I think if I read a few extracts you will allow that Mr. Devlin has, to say the least of it, drawn the long
<col>192</col>
bow in the House of Commons in his statement. Here is one. Mrs. McCann went in July last to her mother's in the country to be confined, and on the 17th of that month&#x2014;you will mark this was in July last&#x2014;the husband wrote to her&#x2014;
<quote>"I got the train alright, thanks to you dear showing me the near cut. I hope you are none the worse for the sharp little walk across the fields on Saturday morning. Mind Agnes, dear, and don't be so silly as to attempt to ride Lizzie's bike, or you might be sorry for it. I feel a bit lonely and wish you were back home again&#x2026;I pray God that you may get safely over your confinement and be restored to your loving husband safe and sound. With love from your loving husband."</quote>
Then follow a number of crosses representing kisses, and a postscript, "Write soon, soon, soon." This is from the man whom Mr. Devlin represents as the husband of an unhappy household. There is only one other paragraph that I should like to read to your Lordships. It is from another letter. The husband went regularly-to the country to see his wife, and on August 10 he wrote again&#x2014;
<quote>"I'm sure you'll wonder at me not writing sooner but I was very tired on Monday night, then I was at church on Tuesday&#x2026;I'll likely be clown on Saturday week. Write soon Agnes, and let me know how yourself and the children are. From your loving husband."</quote>
Then follow eleven crosses representing kisses "for Agnes," and eleven more for "the children." I ask your Lordships as fair men whether that is the class of letter that would be written to a wife by an aggrieved husband. So much for that part of the case in which Mr. Devlin tried to blacken her character by making out that the household was au unhappy one.<lb/>
As my noble friend told the House, Mr. Devlin declared that the whole of the McCann case was got up as a political dodge. "A scandalous political job." Mr. Devlin called it, and in his speech he read a letter that he had got access to somehow. An hon. Member ejaculated that it had been stolen, but of that I know nothing. He read a letter from Mr. McDowell, a solicitor in Belfast, to Mr. Kerr-Smiley, the Member for North Antrim, and from that letter Mr. Devlin, who was dealing, of course, entirely with the McCann case, read this passage&#x2014;
<quote>"I have found a tit-bit at last which will raise all the dormant enthusiasm for the Unionist cause and for the banner which you carry."</quote>
My Lords, I have a copy of that letter' here, and not a single word of that para-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0122"/>
<col>193</col>
graph appears in it; yet Mr. Devlin gave it amidst. cheers, and led the House of Commons to believe that this McCann case was raised by Mr. McDowell for a. political purpose. Then, again, it was stated by Mr. Devlin that it was a political dodge brought forward only just before the General Election. As was pointed out by my noble friend, the date of the General Election was only notified by the Prime Minister on November 18, whereas the children disappeared in October.<lb/>
What happened after that? Mrs. McCann did all she could to effect a settlement. She saw the priest and her husband with no avail. When the question was raised in the other House the Chief Secretary asked why Mrs. McCann had not moved in the matter. But she had moved in the matter. Three sets of summonses had been taken out three weeks running, and to ensure proper service, her solicitor engaged a special bailiff. But McCann could not be found&#x0021; Then, at last, in her distress this poor woman appealed to the Lord Lieutenant for the assistance of the police. When we remember the assistance given by the Government of dozens of policemen to attend cattle-driving&#x2014;not to arrest the cattle-drivers but to drive the cattle back when the drivers thought they had driven them far enough&#x2014;it might have been expected that some assistance would have been given to this unfortunate woman to find her husband and children. I gather that the answer of the Lord Lieutenant in refusing to accede to her appeal was that the case was a civil one. Unless I am mistaken the Chief Secretary, in reply to a question of Mr. Campbell in the House of Commons during the recent debate, stated that if they had ascertained that the man could not be found they would have granted the assistance of the police. If I am correct, that is a most extraordinary statement, for the main object in appealing to the Lord Lieutenant was that the whereabouts of the man and the children could not be ascertained. In the meantime, on November 13, five days before the Prime Minister declared the Dissolution, this case was brought forward for the first time by the Rev. Mr Corkey preaching in his pulpit in Belfast. How can Mr. Devlin, in these circumstances, declare that the whole of this McCann case was a political job got up in order to help the Unionist Party at the General Election?<lb/>
<col>194</col>
There was another point which Mr. Devlin made. He challenged the Unionist Members from Ireland to give the name of the priest who had used his influence with Mrs. McCann. Their answer was a very simple one. It was this "Mrs. McCann does not know the man's name, but she is certain of this, that if the Government would produce the priest she could identify him." Mr. Devlin read out in the House of Commons declarations from three priests. One of those declarations gave fair ground for considering that the priest whose statement it was alleged to be was the priest referred to by Mrs. McCann in her appeal to the Lord Lieutenant. Mrs. McCann stated that a certain priest visited her on several occasions. In the declarations read out by Mr. Devlin only one priest admits calling more than once upon her. His statement runs&#x2014;
<quote>"In my capacity as priest in charge of the district in which the McCann's lived, I visited them for the first time in January, 1910."</quote>
And he goes on to say that neither then, "nor on ally subsequent occasion," did he enter into conversation with her with regard to her marriage. It is clear from that statement that that priest called more than once, and therefore I ask the Government to request Mr. Devlin to produce that priest and bring him face to face with Mrs. McCann in order that she may have an opportunity of saying whether she can identify him as the priest referred to in her Memorial. If she can, then the mystery is solved.<lb/>
I maintain that if the Government desire to solve this mystery and bring this scandalous case to an end, they will take the step I have suggested, and give Mrs. McCann the opportunity of bringing her husband before a Court of law in pursuance of her own rights. What, after all, is this McCann case? It is only an instance of what will again occur unless some steps are taken by the Government to prevent this condition of affairs taking place with regard to mixed marriages. If the Government continue to permit this state of affairs, then I ask them how they can reconcile their action with regard to the Act known as the Act of Supremacy, the Act in which occurs the celebrated and enduring passage&#x2014;
<quote>"No foreign Prince, person, prelate, State, or potentate, spiritual or temporal, shall at any time after the last day of this session of Parliament use, enjoy, or exercise any manner of power, jurisdie-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0123"/>
<col>195</col>
tion, superiority, authority, pre-eminence, or privilege, spiritual or ecclesiastical, within this realm.''</quote>
Unless the Government propose to take some steps I hope the noble Earl will tell me how they reconcile their action of passive activity with the Act of Supremacy. Protestants in Ireland, particularly those of Ulster, feel very strongly that this state of affairs should be allowed under an Imperial Parliament, and they regard with the greatest apprehension what their position will be if a Home Rule Parliament is granted and they are handed over to the Nationalist Roman Catholic majority. Their apprehensions were not allayed by the action of Mr. Gladstone on the Home Rule Bill of 1893, when he refused an Amendment excluding the marriage law from the powers of the Irish Parliament. They remember that quite well, and they now see what would happen to them if an Irish Parliament&#x2014;which God forbid&#x0021;&#x2014;were ever in power on College Green. Mr. Redmond, in all probability, would endeavour to assure the English people that there would be no danger if that were the case. But the Irish people know Mr. Redmond too well; they know that he has three voices, one for England, one for Ireland, and one for his American friends; and they know what a promise in England of toleration from Mr. Redmond means. When the Irish Local Government Bill wits first put into force Mr. Redmond declared that the Unionist Protestant party should have fair treatment in Ireland. My Lords, how did that work out At the present time, outside Ulster, out of something like 684 councillors, there are only fifteen Unionists in the three Provinces. What was Mr. Redmond's opinion on that state of affairs when that was worked out Mr. Redmond in 1902 said that the county councils formed a network of Nationalist organisations all over Ireland. That is one of the instances of Mr. Redmond's toleration.<lb/>
My Lords, I have endeavoured to prove that the statements made by Mr. Devlin with regard to this unfortunate woman were absolutely incorrect, but before I sit down may I say that I do hope His Majesty's Government will carefully consider the opinion of the North of Ireland at the present moment with regard to this question. I have been associated with the North of Ireland during the whole of my political life. I was first returned as
<col>196</col>
Member for County Down thirty-two years ago, and with the exception of three years, which I spent at the Viceregal Lodge, I have been closely identified with these people. Therefore I believe I know the people of Ulster well, and I can assure His Majesty's Government that if they think those people are going quietly to allow their Protestant necks to be put under the Roman Catholic yoke, they are making the greatest mistake they have ever made, and their awakening will be one of the rudest they have ever experienced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00679"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not want to go into this question at length, but I should like to express a hope that before the debate is finished we shall have an answer to what appeared to me to be the most vital portion of the noble Earl's speech. It seems to me that, leaving alone the McCann episode, the most important thing to know is whether anything can be done to prevent such a case occurring again. I have no doubt that the best thing would be, if the Vatican authorities could be prevailed upon to do it, to revert to the <i>status quo ante</i> before the issue of the <i>Ne Tentere</i> decree. I hope we shall hear that His Majesty's Government have considered this proposal, or that they will consider it, and see whether they cannot enter into friendly negotiations with the Roman Catholic authorities with a view to attaining that object. From my own experience I do not know that I am very sanguine as to the success of diploma tic negotiations of this nature, but as the decree has not been issued in Germany there is a strong case for its not being issued in this country, and I hope that point will be noticed by His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00680"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not intended to speak in this debate, but as there seems to be a certain confusion of thought running through it which it appears to me would militate against the calm consideration which is necessary of this question, I hope I may be pardoned for taking part in it. I think the situation is one from which difficulties will undoubtedly arise. 1 do not want to go into the McCann case, because it seems to be surrounded with mystery and difficulty, but I will say, quite frankly, that the publication of the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree in Ireland or in any country must inevitably be followed by incidents of a painful character. That applies, I think,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0124"/>
<col>197</col>
to any question dealing with the marriage law, and also with many other laws. I need not say that it is not specially under this decree that such cases as have been alluded to will arise. We all know that a Catholic cannot enter into a valid marriage in the eyes of the Church with a divorced person. In a case of that kind he might marry without revealing the fact that he was divorced; he might know all along that at any moment he could shield himself behind what he was pleased to call his conscience, and say, "I am not validly married, and I can break the marriage tie." That is one of the conditions in which a scandal of this kind might arise.<lb/>
We have to consider what are the reasons which have induced the Church of Rome at this particular time to promulgate this decree in certain places and to abstain from promulgating it in other places, but without knowing the dangers which the Church of Rome saw which called for that action and the reasons why one district should require the promulgation of the decree and another district not, we are quite unable to approach this question with that calm judgment and knowledge necessary to adequately discuss it. But what I regret is that a question of this kind, which obviously must have a great deal to be said as to it on both sides, should be brought forward with any heat, either politically or from sectarian feelings of animosity. From many points of view I admired the speech of the noble Earl who brought forward this Motion. It was an admirable display of discretion and clear statement, but it was a pity that he appeared to be labouring under an impression that there was some dark design underlying the promulgation of this decree, and that it was an attempt by the Catholic Church to evade the law of the State. I have the more reason to think that that thought has engendered some rancorous spirit in the mind of the noble Earl from a speech of his at a public meeting lately in which he stated that not only was the decree itself offensive in its results, but that it used language of, I think he called it, an insulting kind; that it spoke of people who contracted marriages of this sort as living in a state of concubinage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00681"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My point was that that was the result of the decree. I do not think implied that that

word was used in the decree. It certainly is not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00682"><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Earl was misreported, but in the report in <i>The Times</i> it was set out in inverted commas. I merely mention that because it does show that there seems to be an attempt not to meet this step on the part. of Rome, dealing with this intensely difficult problem of the marriage law, in a spirit of understanding the difficulties that surround it, but to dub it at once as an attack on the part of the Church of Rome on the law of the land. As I have already said, these are problems which are necessarily attended with great difficulty, and the Holy See, whenever she determines to promulgate a decree of this kind, must know the enormous difficulty that exists on both sides, and the steps she takes she undoubtedly believes to be the best. A great many people, no doubt, will not agree with her. In Germany the decree is not enforced. I do not know whether that is because of the representations of the German bishops, but I believe it is very much owing to the fact that the arrangements with regard to these questions in Germany have very recently been put on a new footing, and that, so soon after that had been done, it would have been unwise to disturb matters again by the promulgation of this decree there. I do not know what our own Bishops in England think. I have carefully abstained from asking. But I have no doubt whatever, knowing what I do of human nature and the natural results that follow, that there are many Bishops in England who think it is time that this decree was published, and, on the other hand, that theme are many, no doubt, who think it unfortunate that it has been published and who would be glad to see it removed. But, my Lords, we have the fact of the great difficulties that exist in connection with the marriage law, and the fact that the Church of Rome, acting as the noble Viscount, Lord Llandaff, pointed out, has thought it wise to take this step of promulgating the decree. It appears to me, therefore, that it would be most proper that any representations tending to show objections to that course ought to receive full consideration in order to be temperately and properly brought before the authorities.<lb/>
I cannot help remarking on that point that in Germany steps have been taken for many years now which in this country have
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0125"/>
<col>199</col>
not been taken&#x2014;that is, to have diplomatic relations with the Vatican. For very many years I have hoped that that might be done, and I could weary your Lordships with a recital of the number of illustrious English statesmen who have told me in confidence that they entirely shared my view. But for some reason, and I am not, perhaps, wrong in thinking because of some of the spirit suggested in this debate, they have hesitated from coming forward to propose a way out of the difficulty. I cannot help thinking, if you are disposed to regard Germany as more fortunate than England in that respect, that steps of the kind might be taken on our part with good results. My Lords, all I wish to point out is that there seems to me to be a confusion of thought running through these matters by way of trying to represent that the decree is attacking the law of the land, and I venture to suggest that this question ought not to he viewed from the standpoint of an acrimonious controversy as to the facts of a particular case which it is not unnatural should have happened, and which may happen again, but ought to be viewed from the broader standpoint of the whole difficulty relating to the marriage law, and that when these questions have to be considered they ought to be considered with large minds and with every wish to bring before those who have the power and the authority the closest knowledge of the real needs of the districts concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00683"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BRISTOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very thankful indeed that the noble Duke has raised this debate to a higher level, for it would be an evil thing if a disproportionate view of this debate went forth to the world. Scandalous things, no doubt, have taken place, but I am quite sure that we should treat these difficulties as passing details and strike at something positive and definite. I must say that I think the position in which the noble Viscount, Lord Llanclaff, left the matter was so hopelessly illogical that it is practically almost impossible to leave it so. I hold in my hand a document entitled "Bulla Apostolica "&#x2014;<i>provida sapientique curs;</i> and it is prefaced by a statement that, in respect of the decree of which your Lordships have heard so much, all Catholic marriages in Germany are subject to it, but mixed marriages and the marriages of Protestants are excepted from that decree. I commend that point to

the best consideration of His Majesty's Government. When this unfortunate Mr. McCann is found, let the Civil Courts deal with him, but do not let the House of Lords go away on that point. Let it be seen what is the main thing that has been under discussion here this afternoon. Let the decree apply to the United Kingdom and to the whole of the Empire so far as Catholic marriages are concerned, but let there be the same exception with regard to mixed marriages and Protestant marriages throughout the British Empire as exists throughout the German Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00684"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KINNAIRD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not at this late hour occupy your Lordships more than two minutes. The noble Duke referred to one or two points which I think need the consideration of His Majesty's Government. If he does not know why the present was chosen as the time for introducing this <i>Ne Temere</i> decree into Great Britain&#x2014;for your Lordships will remember that it is introduced not only in Ireland but throughout Great Britain&#x2014;I shall not venture to make any surmise because that would be too rash and too unwise. Some people, however, have hinted that possibly after the concessions which have been made to the Roman Catholic Church this might be a favourable time to gain further advantages. I venture to believe, however, that our Government should demand that we should be placed in the same position as Germany in this matter. Germany, and I am given to understand Hungary also, has protested against being put under this <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, and has not been put under it. Whether that is the case with regard to Hungary or not I have not. been able in the short time at my disposal to verify.<lb/>
But what we complain of in this case is not only with reference to the marriage law, but with reference to this poor woman's property, and why it was not considered right by the Executive in Ireland that her property should be protected. I understand that her own wardrobe and the little trinkets which naturally she valued very much have all been taken and sold, and apparently, from some reference here, it is known by certain ecclesiastical authorities where the husband is and where the children are&#x2014;at any rate it is so far known that they are not within the jurisdiction of the Archbishop in Belfast. I venture to think that in the circumstances
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0126"/>
<col>201</col>
the Irish Executive might have done something to find out where the property of the woman was. But, of course, to her mind the children are of far more interest to her than her property. Some legal difficulty has been raised in another place&#x2014;namely, that the father is entitled to the. children&#x2014;and therefore I understand it is argued that he can pass on his rights to the priests, and hand over the children, who equally belong to a Protestant mother, to some Roman Catholic institution that they may be brought up in. I venture to press upon His Majesty's Government that that side of the question has not been satisfactorily answered. I hold in my hand quotations from text books which are taught from at present in Maynooth and other Roman Catholic Colleges, and which show that the priests are still brought up with the idea that any marriage of men and women not married according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church and made on the strength of no matter what law is nothing else but a shameful concubinage condemned by the Church. So that apparently this teaching is riot a dead letter.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there is the question, which is a far harder one, with regard to our soldiers in Malta. There is no civil marriage there, and every marriage not solemnised in a Roman Catholic church according to the law is invalid. I venture to hope that His Majesty's Government will, if they look into the whole matter, not consider Malta as being unworthy of consideration, and also that this question of the sacrament of marriage will not be looked at as a Party question. Throughout the length and breadth of the Empire many are hoping for some solution of this question, and, as Lord Halifax suggested, the solution might lie in the civil marriage being set up as the legal contract, which could be followed by the religious service settled by the different Churches. At any rate, I cannot but hope that the result of this debate will be to bring us nearer to some settlement which will prevent the recurrence of many of these heartburnings and hardships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00685"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only wish to make a few remarks on this occasion. My noble and learned friend on the Cross Benches (Viscount Llandaff), who always speaks with such authority on this question, gave us some reasons why in the decree of the Council of Trent the marriage
<col>202</col>
law was dealt with. I can quite follow that. But what I do not understand is why, after leaving it for three and a-half centuries where it was, this decree should have been introduced into the United Kingdom four years ago. I do not see any reason for that. The noble Duke who spoke so calmly on the subject did not express himself with any great knowledge as to what had been done, and I am unable to bind anywhere in his speech, or anywhere in the speech of the noble Earl who replied for the Government, any reason why this "bolt from the blue" should have occurred, and why this decree should have been introduced in 1907 after having lain practically dormant so far as we are concerned for three centuries and a-half.<lb/>
No one wants to use intemperate or acrimonious language, but the words of the decree cannot be explained away. It says in absolutely clear terms that a marriage not celebrated before a priest in the way it indicates, shall not be open to question and discipline, but shall be null and void. It is as clear and strong a statement as can be made. The noble Viscount said that it expressly excluded non-Catholics. I cannot find that. The words are Iabsolute and unqualified.. It applies to every one, at all events, who takes part in a mixed marriage. This decree was not introduced in 1907 in order to remain a dead letter. It was intended that something should be done under it, and the importance of the McCann case is that it affords a concrete instance of what was done and how it was done, and that I cannot but think is extremely material. My noble friend on the Cross Benches pointed with great force to what had been done in Germany, and asked whether a similar withdrawal could not take place with reference to this country. I do not know how that may be, but it certainly is significant that in Germany this was appreciated to be such a grievance that it was withdrawn. A separate decree was issued especially to meet the case of Germany exempting mixed marriages in that country from the operation of this decree, and I believe the same thing also happened in Hungary, where the decree was suspended for six or twelve months. I do not know what its present position may be.<lb/>
If this were merely an academic question of the revival of a decree and then leaving
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0127"/>
<col>203</col>
it where it was before, I would not be very much concerned to discuss it, or say anything about it; but the importance of the McCann case is that it shows how it is intended to be worked, and how it has worked as a matter of fact. The facts of the case have been presented so clearly by my noble friend behind me that I do not deem it necessary to go through them again. They are significant and painful. A blameless woman of unblemished character belonging to the Presbyterian Church married a Roman Catholic, lived with him for two years, and had two children. Then, owing to the intervention of a clergyman&#x2014;it is not denied, it has not been suggested that she did not tell the truth&#x2014;her home was broken up, and her happiness wrecked. Her children have been removed and she herself has had to leave the place destitute and homeless, with neither children nor husband. Even her clothes and articles of personal property were taken away from her. It is, I suppose, about as painful and grave an incident as could well take place.<lb/>
It has been pointed out that the Church has some duty. Surely the State has some duty, too. Surely the State is bound to look after its subjects when they are treated in this way? It has been asked, What could the Government do? They could certainly have done something. No one knows better than the noble Earl opposite the powers of Dublin Castle. I also know a little about them. They could have found out the whereabouts of the husband; they could have found out the whereabouts of the children; and that would have been a reasonable thing to do. Have they done it? Where are the children now? Where is the husband now? Do they know the name of the priest? Have they tried to find out the name of the priest? Those are all obvious questions that we are entitled to ask. The circumstances of the case are so painful and so distressing that they cannot be brushed aside as being of no moment. The whole thing is not a dream. It is an absolute reality that this unfortunate woman's home has been broken up by the application of this <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, There is no suggestion of any other reason. If there had been no promulgation of this decree within the last three years this woman's home would have remained unbroken and unwrecked, the husband and wife living happily as
<col>204</col>
before, and the poor woman would have been left with her children, one of whom was practically torn from her breast a month after birth.<lb/>
My Lords, I am not concerned with the reasons that influenced the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church to pass originally three and a-half centuries ago the decree of the Council of Trent. Probably they had the best of reasons, but after three and a-half centuries they have now promulgated it in the United Kingdom. We are bound to see that the laws of our country are observed, and that when our subjects are married in a Protestant Church and what has taken place is legal and in accordance with our law, that marriage should not be set aside. I listened to the noble Viscount on the Cross Benches and to the noble Duke behind me explaining away, or seeking to explain away, what has been done, but they could not explain away the words themselves. I have them here before me. The words are as clear as crystal, not that a priest should invoke his bishop to get authority, but that unless the marriage is celebrated by the priest in the presence of two witnesses it shall be null and void. I suggest that what has been done in Germany and Hungary should be done in this country, and I trust that further consideration and further thought will induce those responsible for the promulgation of the decree to take care that it is safeguarded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00686"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the subject of this debate has, as has more than once been stated, divided itself into two distinct parts&#x2014;first, the criticism which has been passed upon the Church of Rome for having promulgated the decree <i>Ne Temere</i> in these islands, and, secondly, the case of Mr. and Mrs. McCann which is stated to have arisen out of that promulgation. Like my noble friend opposite. I am in this position, that if the noble Duke, who speaks with so much authority, cannot say why the authorities at Rome chose this time for promulgating this decree in this country, it is certainly not for me to attempt to do so. But I think it is possible that one of the reasons which may have actuated the Church was that they believed that the promulgation would in itself operate as a distinct discouragement to mixed marriages, which they dislike; and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0128"/>
<col>205</col>
I am confirmed in that statement by a sentence in the pastoral of Cardinal Logue recently published, from which the noble Earl opposite has already quoted. The Cardinal said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the decree <i>Ne Temere</i> attains one object, which is no doubt among those chielly intended by the Holy Father, the cessation or a decrease of mixed marriages, it will confer au inestimable blessing on. Roman. Catholics."</quote>
Be that as it may, there will undoubtedly remain, and I suspect not only among us of the. Church of England and others but among Roman Catholics also, grave doubts as to the practical wisdom of the step.<lb/>
Then noble Lords opposite have asked whether it is possible for us to approach the Church of Rome with a view to getting the promulgation withdrawn. I am quite certain the House will not expect me to give anything like a definite answer to that question. The noble Duke spoke of the fact that we have no means of direct communication with the Vatican. I shall certainly not express an opinion as to whether it would be advantageous or not that we should have such means of communication, but I cannot help thinking that the noble Earl who introduced this Motion and the noble Marquess who spoke afterwards might think the remedy even worse than the disease, and that some of the hard things which have been said to-day about the Church of Rome might be repeated with even greater vigour. In any case, I hope that there will be no question of entrusting any negotiations or approaches either to the noble Earl or the noble Marquess, and I cannot help saying that if this question is to be settled, and ever can be settled, by friendly approaches, it is a misfortune that the tone of bitterness which, I am bound to say, was so marked through both the speeches of the noble Earl and the noble Marquess should have been used. The noble Marquess's tone, indeed, was one of direct defiance of Rome and all its works, and if that tone or anything like it is to be used it is hardly to be expected that the Roman authorities would meet us half-way.<lb/>
As regards the effect of the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, there is, of course, no real difference of opinion. We all know that the civil law cannot possibly be over-ridden, although it may conflict. We all remember that the Protestant Reformation in this country, so far as the State began to be interested in it, arose out of this very question, the
<col>206</col>
question of a marriage and the conflict between the civil authority of that day and the authority of the Church, and, as has been pointed out in the course of the debate, even as matters now stand in this country the Church of England is not altogether free from this difficulty. We all remember the debates on the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, and the announcement that was made by many speaking on behalf of the clergy and by the clergy themselves, that they would not celebrate such marriages or regard them as valid marriages in the religious sense. It would be even more difficult in some ways, particularly in view of a possible extension of the facilities for divorce, having regard to the attitude which the Church of England takes up, and has a right as a Church to take up, with reference to the re-marriage of divorced persons. Those considerations, I think, may make us feel that, whether the action of the Church of Rome was right or wrong in this particular instance, the difficulty is not one which is only Roman, but is one which is liable to arise in all countries ill which the Church and the State are not concurrent authorities. All persons, therefore, however much they may be acting in accord with their conscience, who break the civil law in this respect become subject to the penalties which the law exacts. But I am bound to say it seems to me that a very grave responsibility rests upon the priests or ministers of any religion, who lead people to believe that they are not married in the religious sense, to make 'clear to them at the same time what their civil position is and what are the duties which the law imposes upon people who have gone through the civil ceremony of marriage. From the point of view, of course, of the Roman Catholic Church these people were only civilly married; they were not religiously married. No distinction was drawn, as has been attempted to be drawn in the course of this debate, between a marriage in a Protestant Church or Chapel and a marriage before a Registrar.<lb/>
I pass to the case of Mr. and Mrs. McCann, and I am bound to say that, so far as I am able to discover from the papers that I have read, it is accurate to say that the facts of the case are not altogether established. The statement of the noble Marquess on the subject was, as I think he must himself admit, of a thoroughly <i>ex parte</i> character, and it is true that we have not heard all the facts on the other side.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0129"/>
<col>207</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00687"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I might remind the noble Earl that I took the line I did in order to controvert the effect of the statement made by Mr. Devlin in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00688"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand that; but Mr. Devlin's speech was itself in reply to an <i>ex parte</i> statement which had made out that the faults were entirely on one side, that not only was the husband an undesirable person&#x2014;and I think the evidence, so far as we have it, goes to show that he undoubtedly was&#x2014;but that the wife was in all respects the injured party, and that there was, in fact, nothing whatever to be said on the other side of the case. To refer for one moment to a more general aspect of the case, we must not forget that, although in this particular instance the husband may or may not have acted conscientiously&#x2014;I do not pretend to say whether he did or did not in the first instance&#x2014;it cannot be disputed that he might have acted conscientiously so far as separation from his wife was concerned, but certainly not so far as his desertion of her was concerned. It is not an inconceivable case. In fact, we know that the most painful instances of the kind do happen in the case of people who have believed themselves to be properly married in the religious sense as well as in the legal sense, and who have, owing to coming under some religious influence, or for some other reason, come to the conclusion that their marriage is not valid in a religious sense. They are naturally torn in two between conflicting duties, their duty towards their religion and their duty towards the person, and a most agonising struggle must sometimes ensue. I only point that out because it seems to have been assumed all through this debate that the effect of the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree is only the indirect effect, or likely to be the indirect effect, of making unscrupulous people lure innocent girls and others into marriage under false pretences. But you cannot ignore the other aspect of the case in which people may think it right to separate from purely conscientious motives.<lb/>
So far as regards McCann he, as I say, has apparently not taken that course, because, so far as one can judge, he has been guilty of the offence of deserting his wife. Whether it is true, as the noble Marquess said, that they had lived in undisturbed and almost Arcadian happiness up to the time when religious influences were brought
<col>208</col>
to bear, I do not feel sure. The letters which the noble Marquess quoted are not, I think, in themselves conclusive evidence in a matter of this kind, because I believe it to he the fact&#x2014;and it is a singular fact&#x2014;that even in divorce cases in which the greatest. cruelty as well as infidelity has been proved, affectionate letters often have passed between the parties, written both by the injured and by the guilty party. However that may be, it is stated that the lives of these people were disturbed by quarrels, partly, perhaps, arising out of religious differences, and partly, possibly, from other causes. Both the noble Earl and the noble Marquess commented on the supposed evidence of the three priests, and the noble Earl said that it was no use to know that three priests did not tell the woman that she was not validly married, because there were 3,000 priests in Ireland any one of whom might have done it. That is true, but still these were the three priests of the district, and it seems in itself unlikely that a man should have taken the trouble to come from a distance in order to make this announcement.<lb/>
Then we are asked why it was that the police did not take immediate action to discover the whereabouts of McCann and the children, and the noble Marquess said that if the police could be detailed in respect of cattle-drives they might at any rate be detailed for the purpose of assisting this poor woman. The police can only be detailed where a criminal offence has been committed. The mere fact that this woman was hardly treated, assuming for the moment that she was thoroughy hardly treated, would not of itself give the police a right to interfere, and it was only when the authorities became aware that there were grounds for supposing McCann to be guilty of a criminal offence that they felt called upon to move in the matter, and did move. The noble Marquess asks why we do not produce McCann and produce the priest, or take steps to discover them. The police are like other people in this country; they have to do the best they can by the ordinary methods of inquiry. We have no means of taking the priest and putting him to torture in order to discover where McCann is, or of adopting any Oriental method of the kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00689"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: The point I made was this: Mr. Devlin quoted from a letter written by McCann to a correspondent of his, and therefore
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0130"/>
<col>209</col>
that correspondent could tell Mr. Devlin where McCann is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00690"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is a matter for Mr. Devlin. If Mr. Devlin is unwilling to state it we cannot compel him to do so, even supposing he knows, and that fact is not quite proved by the statement of the. noble Marquess, because McCann need not have put his address on the letter. But, as I say, even supposing Mr. Devlin knows, we have no means of making him divulge the address. It is really not fair to say that either the Irish Government or the police have been inactive in the matter. Neither is it at all fair to say that my noble friend the Viceroy acted in an unsympathetic manner in regard to this case. It is quite true that when Mrs. McCann wrote to Dublin Castle she received an officially-worded reply. As everybody knows, official replies, either from Dublin Castle or elsewhere, arc not as a rule effusively worded; but it is absurd to suppose that my noble friend the Viceroy would have been otherwise than sympathetic in this case, since, being as lie is a Scottish Presbyterian, his prejudices must necessarily have been on the side of. Mrs. McCann.<lb/>
I am certainly not in the least surprised, knowing what 1 do of Ireland, that this lamentable case should have aroused very deep feeling there, and I do not complain that it should have done so; but I do not think it can be disputed that the incident has been used for what it is worth as a political engine. The noble Marquess himself would not, I think, dispute that, because at the close of his speech he did precisely what I have described. He said that this case is an instance of what will happen to most people, or to a large number of people, in Ireland if you give Home Rule. That is clearly using this story for a political object. Nor do I say that it is altogether an unnatural thing for the noble Marquess to do. The noble Marquess said that in the quotation of a letter in another place a sentence was read which did not appear in the letter. That was quite true. How the mis-quotation came to be made I do not know, but this sentence did appear in that letter, written by Mr. McDowell to Mr. Kerr-Smiley, the Member for North Antrim&#x2014;
<quote>"I suppose you saw yesterday's <i>Whig</i> and <i>News Letter</i> in relation to the kidnapped children. It is having a tremendous effect here. I am told it will have the same tremendous effect in Scotland. It ought to he useful to you in the shape of stiffening the waverers."</quote>
<col>210</col>
As I say, I should have been greatly surprised if some such use had not been made of it. Then my noble friend behind me quoted the case of the two Presbyterian clergymen who spoke on November 2, both of whom stated in different words that this event had been brought about by Divine Providence as a warning to the people of both countries and in order to give some slight impression of what might happen in certain circumstances. It seems to me that that was a little hard on Mrs. McCann. who for the moment must be supposed to have been ignored by Divine Providence, and it is an expression which, it seems to me, is a strange one for a minister of religion to have used. But it only shows what we know to be the case, that feeling in these matters does run very high.<lb/>
I can assure noble Lords opposite that, so far as McCann can be shown to have been guilty of any offence against the law, every effort will be made to bring him to book for that offence; and if he is brought to book and it is shown that he has been guilty not merely of a technical offence against the law, but of heartless and cruel conduct, I sincerely hope he will receive such punishment as he deserves and as it is possible to inflict according to the law. I am sure the noble Duke opposite takes the same view</membercontribution></p>

<col>211</col>
that I should object to any communication taking place between the Government and the Church of Rome. So far from that being so, such communications are going on almost every day.

It would, therefore, be perfectly easy for the Government to negotiate directly with the Archbishop, and I am sure they would find him always ready to discuss any subject of the kind with them. I hope they will do so. I beg to withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DUTIES ON CLAY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00717"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CRUDLEIGH</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government for what reason the Commissioners of Inland Revenue refuse to make public the interpretation they put on subsection 5 of section 20, Finance Act, 1909&#x2013;1910, or to state what kind of clays are, in their opinion, not included in the exceptions of "common clay and common brick clay."</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00718">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have put this Question on the Paper because it seems to me that the method of procedure involved is one to which public attention should be called. The facts of the matter are those. The section of the Finance Ac<ob/> to which I allude excludes from the definition of minerals all common clay, common brick clay, common brick earth, or sand, chalk, limestone, or gravel. It is not. I think, unnatural for any one making a return and coining in contact with this exception to ask the Commissioners of Inland Revenue for some information as to the way in which they intended to construe the section. Accordingly I wrote to the Commissioners and asked them to give me some kind of definition of what they considered common clays. I expected to get an answer to the effect that they considered that clays which paid more than a certain amount were in the category of uncommon clays. or that they had taken some geological line of difference between the nature of one clay and another. To this request, however, I got no satisfactory reply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00719">I then endeavoured to extract information from them by suggesting that clays worked in the ordinary way were common clays, but this they disputed; and then I received this letter&#x2014;
<quote>"I am directed by the Board of Inland Revenue to acquaint you that they do not feel justified in giving an answer in general terms which might commit them in advance to a definite course of action in individual cases, the facts and circumstances of which have not been laid before them. In these circumstances, beyond observing that all unworked clay must be regarded as normally liable to Mineral Rights Duties unless it is shown to fall within the exceptions in the subsection, the Board do not feel that they can usefully add anything."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00720">The Commissioners, therefore, stand in this position, that every person who has any mineral to which this exception might possibly refer is obliged to appeal because he cannot get any answer from the Commissioners as to the interpretation they are
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0133"/>
<col>215</col>
going to put upon these exceptions. In addition to that, it is quite impossible for one person to know whether the clay in which he is dealing is going to be treated in the same way as clay belonging to another person and very possibly competing in the same trade.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00721">This is establishing&#x2014;and I suppose to that extent we ought to feel flattered&#x2014;a small Finance Act individually for each of us; but it seems to me, in consonance with the common principles of taxation, that the rules of taxation should be clear and should be the same for all. The method of taxation here seems to be determined entirely by the Commissioners' own opinion, and there are no means by which any body of taxpayers can bring their decision generally before the Courts of law because the Commissioners openly say in the letter that they are going to judge each individual applicant by a rule entirely for himself and for himself alone. If this is going to be the practice, it is a serious innovation. I have therefore ventured to call your Lordships' attention to it, and to ask His Majesty's Government whether they cannot see some way of giving an explanation of this exception which may be intelligible to all and applicable to all to whom the exception in the Act refers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00722"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think there is any innovation, as the noble Lord appears to think, in this matter. I will read to the House the subsection of the Finance Act to which the noble Lord refers. it runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The Mineral Rights Duty shall not be charged in respect of common clay, common brick clay, common brick earth, or sand, chalk, limestone, or gravel."</quote>
The question whether any particular kind of clay falls within this exception is one which has to be dealt with as it arises, and for this reason. I am informed by the Inland Revenue that there are hundreds of different kinds of clay, and that it would be impossible to frame a definition as to what clays come within the term "common clay and common brick clay." The Commissioners of Inland Revenue decide the question in each case which comes before them, having regard to the composition of the clay, the use to which it is put, and the rate of royalty in respect of it, and in cases of doubt they take expert geological advice. If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioners,
<col>216</col>
his proper course is to appeal to a referee in the manner provided by Section 33 of the Finance Act and the rules made under the section. I may add that the referees were appointed for the express purpose of deciding such cases as those to which the noble Lord has referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00723"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OP CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Will the referees give the reasons for their judgment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00724"><member>LORD DENMAN</member><membercontribution>: I cannot state whether the referees will publish the reasons why they arrive at any decision. I will make inquiries as to what the exact practice of the referees is. I will, of course, undertake to convey what the noble Lord has said to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, but I cannot hold out any hope that they will alter what is their practice, because, for the reasons I have stated, it is absolutely impossible that they can frame a definition that will cover all the different kinds of clay with which they may have to deal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00725"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it seems to me that the argument of the noble Lord who has just sat down is no answer to my noble friend, but rather strengthens the case which he has brought before the House. In the first place, the noble Lord tells us that there are many kinds of clay. Well, I should have thought that made it all the more desirable that the kinds of clay liable to duty should be distinguished from those not liable to duty. Then the noble Lord said that the main points on which the Commissioners determine the matter were the composition of the clay, the use to which it is put, and the price paid for the clay. There is no great difficulty in determining the composition of the clay. Clay is alumina mixed with a larger or smaller proportion of impurities, and it would be easy to say that clay containing a certain proportion of alumina should not be taxed. Then as to the use made of it, it might be provided that any clay used for making ordinary bricks would not be liable to duty; and as to the price paid for the clay, it would be quite easy to say that no clay which was sold below a certain price would be liable to the duty. I submit, therefore, that the reasons which have been given for not complying with the request of the noble Lord who brought forward this question were really not germane to the point, but that if anything they go to strengthen his case.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IMPERIAL AND LOCAL FINANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00726"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether they adhere to the pledge given by them in this House on the 13th July, 1910, that the Government, if in power, would during the present year make an attempt to deal with the whole subject of the financial relations between the Imperial Exchequer and local authorities; and whether it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to withhold from local authorities half the net proceeds of the Land Values Taxation to which they are entitled under the express provisions of Section. 91 of the Finance (1909&#x2013;1910) Act, 1910; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00727">The noble Earl said: My Lords, your Lordships will remember that last July a pledge was given to us in this House by the noble Earl the Leader of the House that the whole question of local taxation would be dealt with by His Majesty's Government during the present year provided that the same Government found themselves in office. The noble Earl, as representing the then Government, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I can say quite definitely that if we find ourselves next year in the position of advising the Crown we shall make an attempt to deal with the whole of this subject. The noble Earl can take it from me that that is so. Of course, whether it might he possible to conclude the whole subject during the compass of a single session I cannot say, but we shall certainly make the attempt."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00728">The noble Earl not only gave us this definite assurance that the Government would deal with the readjustment of the onerous burdens now falling on the ratepayers, but he also claimed some credit to the Government in the fact that one-half of the yield of the Land Values Duties was to go to the local authorities. In fact, two pledges were made by His Majesty's Government to the ratepayers of this country. The first pledge was that one-half of these Land Taxes was to be allocated to the local authorities. The second pledge was that the Government would deal with the whole question of local taxation during the present year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00729">The reason I have brought forward this subject is that from discussions which have recently taken place in the House of Commons I fear there is reason to believe that, in spite of the pledge given to us by the noble Earl opposite, no practical steps are to be taken to readjust the financial
<col>218</col>
relations between the Imperial Exchequer and the local authorities during the present year; and, further, despite the promises made by the Government which have since been enshrined in that Act of Parliament known as the "People's Budget," that the people as represented by the local authorities are still to be denuded of their share of these Land Taxes. I do not propose to go into a detailed account of the many grievances under which the ratepayers of this country suffer. I dealt with this last year, and to enter into detail now would only be going over old ground again. The reality of those grievances and the urgent necessity of readjusting the burden of taxation have been admitted over and over again As recently as February 20 of this year Mr. Lloyd George stated, in another place, that&#x2014;
<quote>"as long as the Chancellor of the Exchequer has not a final re-arrangement of the relations between local and Imperial finance, it will be, ruinous both to the local and Imperial Exchequer."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00730">Whatever may be the effect on Imperial finance&#x2014;and I think the Chancellor's words are justified&#x2014;it certainly is true as regards local finance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00731">Every year since the passing of the Local Government Act in 1888 the position of the local authorities has become more difficult owing to the ever-increasing burdens thrown on them by Parliament and the effect of legislation on the revenues which were assigned to them. If we take the case of London alone, we find a net additional expenditure since April, 1904, of &#x00A3;680,000 a year after deducting all Government grants. This vast annual expenditure is entirely due to new national duties or to the further development of old duties. Then, again, we find that, in spite of this great increase in the expenditure forced on local authorities by Parliament, the direct effect of much of the legislation of recent years has been to deprive local authorities of the benefits to which they were previously entitled. As I have already stated, I am not going to weary the House by entering into a lot of detail, but, if your Lordships will permit me, I will give one example, very briefly, to show the way in which local authorities have been treated financially by the present Government. Under the Licensing Act of 1904 a Unionist Government for the first time secured for the community the monopoly value of new licences. It provided that just as local authorities benefited
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0135"/>
<col>219</col>
by the License Duties on licensed premises in their districts, so they should benefit by the amount exacted in payment of monopoly value on every new public-house. Then came along the Liberal Government and with their Budget they laid hands&#x2014;I might say greedy hands&#x2014;on this new source of revenue, and claimed the whole of it for the Imperial Exchequer. Another effect of that same Budget was to greatly decrease the assessable value of licensed premises, thereby decreasing the annual revenue which local authorities derive in rates from that source of revenue. Although this has affected London perhaps in a greater degree than the rest of the country, and although as a member of the London County Council I am naturally interested in London's case, I have not risen to present the case for London. I have brought forward this Motion in the interests of the ratepayers of England, Wales, and my own country, Scotland, who I think will probably have a great deal to say in regard to this question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00732">What I want to ascertain, if I can, is whether the pledges made by His Majesty's Government to the ratepayers of the United Kingdom are going to be redeemed. The last settlement of this question took place in 1888, when the Local Government Act was passed. Certain revenues were then assigned to meet certain services in place of the old system of direct grants in aid. It was admitted recently by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that these assigned revenues had not expanded as they ought to have done to meet the growing cost of services of a national character such as education and the relief of the poor. At the same time the Financial Secretary attempted to find some shelter for His Majesty's Government in the fact that many of these burdens under which the ratepayers now suffer were not the result of any action of a Liberal Government, but were due to the administration and legislation of a Conservative Government. Mr. Hob-house quoted in support of his argument various measures of social legislation passed by the late Unionist Government. I am glad to find a Radical Minister paying this tribute to the social legislation of a Conservative Government. I am certainly not going to combat his assertion, because in my opinion it is quite immaterial to the question I am discussing. But I might point out, in passing, that the late Unionist Government, in laying these burdens on the
<col>220</col>
ratepayers, did at any rate make some restitution&#x2014;not sufficient, but they did make some restitution&#x2014;to the local authorities in respect of these burdens, and the present Government have entirely failed to do so. Anyhow, social legislation has got to be paid for, and what we are concerned with is not as to what Government passed these measures, but as to what Government is going to remedy the injustice of the incidence of the cost thereof.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00733">I assert that a Unionist Government would have dealt with this matter. A Liberal Government have pledged themselves to do so, but are showing distinct signs of postponing to an indefinite future the carrying out of their pledges. I think the ratepayers will have every reason to doubt the good faith of the present Government when they read the recent speeches of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Hobhouse in the House of Commons. On the Amendment moved to the Address by Mr. Hayes Fisher on February 13, Mr. Hobhouse, replying for the Government, gave us to understand that what the Government meant by the pledges that they gave was not to deal with this question of local taxation at all this year, but to appoint a Committee to find out how they ought to deal with it. This is apparently, as far as I can find out, the interpretation which the Government now put on the assurances given us by the noble Earl opposite and by Mr. Lloyd George. I can undertake to say that that is not the interpretation that was placed on their words by the ratepayers of the country, not one of whom doubted that His Majesty's Government had pledged themselves to bring in some definite scheme to deal with this question of local taxation during the present year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00734">To turn to another matter. This apparently is not the only pledge which is to be broken. A statement was recently made by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in the House of Commons from which I infer that the section in the Finance Act of 1909&#x2013;10 allocating to local authorities one-half of the proceeds of the Duties on Land Values is now to be repealed. When the Budget of 1909 was first introduced it contained no provision for helping local authorities from this source of revenue, but so great was the hostility shown by local authorities throughout the country to this portion of the Budget that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to climb down
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0136"/>
<col>221</col>
and to promise local authorities one-half of these taxes. To put it quite plainly, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to make certain of receiving sufficient support in the country for his Budget. Therefore he made this definite promise to the local authorities, which has since been embodied in Section 91 of the Finance Act. After a General Election, resulting, as your Lordships will remember, in the loss of, I think, over 100 seats to the Government supporters, that Budget was passed through the House of Commons in circumstances which it is needless to discuss now. The point is that ever since this bargain was struck between the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the one side and the local ratepayers on the other, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been trying to rid himself of his responsibility in this matter. I think many noble Lords on this side of the House are with me when I say that we are not opposed to a local community deriving its fair share of the increased value of land in urban districts, recognising that part of that increment value may be due to the presence and expenditure of that community. That probably was only partially recognised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in allocating one-half of the Land Taxes to the local authorities. Now in claiming the whole of these taxes for the Imperial Exchequer the Government have got rid of the only shred of principle on which these taxes can he defended.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00735">Perhaps I am premature in my deductions as to the intentions of His Majesty's Government, but their action in regard to the allocation of these moneys is certainly calculated to breed distrust of their good faith. Let me follow out the transactions in chronological order. In April, 1909, the Land Taxes were introduced and were to be entirely for the benefit of the Imperial Exchequer. In June, 1909, after pressure from the representatives of the ratepayers, one-half of these taxes was allocated to the local authorities. In the beginning of 1910 representations began. coming in from the local authorities in regard to the shortage in the yield from the beer and spirit duties&#x2014;what is generally known as the whisky money. That same year the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with a great show of generosity, promised to compensate the local authorities for this shortage, which was almost entirely due to the Government's legislation, but in doing this he proposed to impound for that year one-half of the Land
<col>222</col>
Taxes to which the local authorities were already legally entitled as a set-off against the compensation he was going to give them on account of the shortage in the whisky money. Then we come to June 30 last year, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer made his Budget statement for 1910&#x2013;11. In making that statement he announced the intention of the Government to remove the pauper disqualification for an old age pension imposed under their Act of 1908. He did not propose to make this relief as a free gift to the local authorities. It would reduce to some extent the poor rate. Therefore he told the local authorities that they would have to pay just so much as the rates were relieved by&#x2014;in his own words, not a penny more; and that the Imperial Exchequer would bear all the rest of the cost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00736">We now come to the latest stage in this comedy. Section 91 of the Finance Act of 1909&#x2013;10 provides for the payment of half of the net proceeds of the duties on Land Values to the local authorities. That Act became law last year. During the past week the House of Commons has been engaged in discussing important parts of last year's Budget which were hung up by the Government in order to fight a General Election just before Christmas. In consequence of this a new Money Bill has just made its appearance. The Government, with some sarcasm, have christened it the "Revenue Bill." I think the local authorities when they have studied Clause 10 might be excused if they called it the "Revenue Grabbing Bill." Clause 10 is very important, and I propose to give your Lordships its exact words&#x2014;
<quote>"Section 91 of the principal Act, which provides for the payment of half the proceeds of the duties on Land Values for the benefit of local authorities, shall cease to have effect, and shall be deemed never to have had effect."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00737">The clause is short. I cannot say, from the point of view of the local authorities, that it is sweet. Not only do the Government propose to take back what they have promised, and promised in an Act of Parliament, but they go on to provide that the promise shall be deemed never to have had any effect. I think the representatives of the ratepayers in this country will be inclined to ask, When is a promise not a promise?&#x2014;a conundrum the solution of which I will leave to His Majesty's Ministers in this House.</p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0137"/>
<col>223</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00738">The Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hobhouse, speaking in the House of Commons on February 20, attempted to justify the Government's action by informing the House that they were giving relief to the local bodies in another form by taking over the whole of the cost of the pauper pensions. With a skill I cannot but envy. Mr. Hobhouse has drawn up a profit and loss account, and has shown a balance on the whole transaction in favour of the local authorities to the amount of &#x00A3;40,000 a year. I want, if your Lordships. will permit me, to briefly examine the methods by which Mr. Hobhouse has so ingeniously produced this credit balance. He has, first of all, included in his calculations the compensation paid to the local authorities for the shortage in the Beer and Spirit Duties&#x2014;a shortage which is entirely due to the Government's legislation, a fact which I think I am justified in saying the Government have admitted because they have stereotyped the amount to be paid under that head to the local authorities at the year 1908&#x2013;9, which is a period before their recent penal taxation so seriously decreased the yield from this branch of revenue. Mr. Hobhouse then went on to assert that the Old Age Pension Act and the removal of the pauper disqualification, the whole cost of which is to be borne by the Imperial Exchequer, will represent a further contribution to the local bodies of &#x00A3;1.500,000 a year. I had always understood that the Old Age Pension Act was but one step, the first step, towards that further assistance from the Imperial Exchequer in aid of the poor rate which was so strongly recommended by the Royal Commission on Local Taxation. It does not take the form of a direct grant, but is in effect a partial transfer of part of the service of Poor-law relief from the local authorities to the State. It has nothing whatever to do with the Land Taxes, which are derived from purely local sources. There is no justification for earmarking any part of the resources of that taxation towards making up any deficiency in Imperial subventions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00739">I go further than this, and question the accuracy of the balance which has been arrived at by Mr. Hobhouse. Take London as a test case. In consequence of the removal of the pauper disqualification 10,983 paupers came oft the rates since the beginning of the year. Some of these, I believe, have since returned; but, taking
<col>224</col>
this figure as it stands, it represents a saving, in round figures, of some &#x00A3;80.000 a year. Even if we add to this the amount to be paid in compensation for the shortage in the whisky money we only get a further contribution, in round figures, of &#x00A3;47,000 a year, making a total of &#x00A3;127,000 a year. Against this the London ratepayers have sustained a loss of their share of the Land Taxes, which has been estimated at &#x00A3;100,000 a year; and it is important to remember, in estimating the revenue from the Land Taxes, that such revenue would be an increasing one. There is a further loss to the local authorities which the Financial Secretary to the Treasury did not include in his estimate&#x2014;I refer to the decreased assessable value of licensed premises. This is a very important omission. The loss of assessable value to London under this head is &#x00A3;370,000. This means an annual loss of revenue from local rates of &#x00A3;157,000 a year, including the Metropolitan Water Board rate. If we add the loss of London's share of the Land Taxes we get a total of &#x00A3;257,000 as against a gain of &#x00A3;127,000, showing a. net loss to London, in round figures, of &#x00A3;130,000 a year. Mr. Hobhouse produced a lot of figures and showed a balance in favour of the local authorities throughout the whole of the United Kingdom of &#x00A3;40,000. I have also drawn up a profit and loss account, and I venture to say that my figures are quite correct, and I do not think they will be questioned by any noble Lord on the Government Bench. I have worked out, instead of a balance of &#x00A3;40,000 in favour of the local authorities, that in the case of London alone the balance on the whole transaction is a net loss of &#x00A3;130,000 a year. That, my Lords, is an example of what Mr. Hobhouse has designated a most generous contribution from the Imperial Exchequer to the local authorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00740">I wish to be quite fair to His Majesty's Government, but let us look at this from the point of view of the man in the street&#x2014;the elector who pays rates. Many men supported His Majesty's Government at the General Election in January, 1910, on the promise of receiving some relief from the new Land Taxes pending a final readjustment of the burdens now falling on the ratepayers. His Majesty's Government now come forward and say that they cannot possibly deal with this question of local taxation this year. They also tell
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0138"/>
<col>225</col>
the ratepayer that they must retain his share of the Land. Taxes until they do deal with the question. They have got the unfortunate ratepayer both ways. They refuse to legislate for him, and until they do legislate they refuse to pay him what they owe him. I submit that, even in the brief statement I have ventured to make to the House to-day, I have shown that the Government have a case, and a serious case, to answer. The ratepayers have not only got to bear the burdens of purely local administration, but also those additional burdens which Parliament is so ready to place upon them. I may mention, in passing, that Parliament since 1888 has passed over 600 different Acts under which new duties are imposed and new powers conferred on local authorities. The undeniable fact is that the cost of local government has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished. I do not think the Government are dealing quite fairly with this grave matter on behalf of the overburdened ratepayers, and I hope that we shall receive some definite assurance this evening that steps will be taken without delay to remedy the undoubted grievances I which exist.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00741"><i>Moved</i>. That there be laid before the House Papers respecting the financial relations between the Imperial Exchequer and local. authorities.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Dunmore.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00742"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I say a word in reply to the speech of the noble Earl, perhaps I may be permitted to allude to the loss which the House has sustained by the death of Lord Wolverhampton in connection with the particular subject which is before us at this moment. When Lord Wolverhampton came to this House he was advanced in years, and his health had suffered, arid we did riot enjoy the advantage of hearing any real specimens of that remarkable eloquence which, at its best, placed him in the very front rank of Parliamentary speakers. On such a subject as this, in which his knowledge was almost unsurpassed, we ought, I think, to pay a tribute to his memory, recognise his loss, and express our sympathy with those who are mourning him.<lb/>
The noble Earl alluded at the beginning of his speech to some observations of mine made in July of last year, and he, I have no
<col>226</col>
doubt, thinks that I ought to be appearing at this Table attired in a white sheet with a candle in my hand. I must endeavour to make the best case I can, because it is quite true that I did assert on behalf of His Majesty's Government, as my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer did in another place, quite categorically that it was our intention to deal, if possible, with the whole of this subject this year. The noble Earl very fairly quoted the whole of my observations on this particular point, including the expression in which I safeguarded what I said. After saying that we were determined to deal with the subject, I added&#x2014;
<quote>"Whether it might he possible to conclude the whole subject during ff the compass of a single session, I cannot say."</quote>
That applied, of course, to a clear session, and I most frankly admit that in making that statement when I did I was thinking of a clear session and not of the session which we are now beginning.<lb/>
It was impossible to foresee in July last that the Constitutional question would swallow up, as it is going to swallow up, practically the whole time of this session. In the month of July I had no hesitation in saying that I, for one, was very hopeful that that question might have been settled in a manner which would not have involved the expenditure of time which it is going to involve during practically the whole, or at any rate a very great part, of the forthcoming session, and the fact that this is so is to me an acute disappointment. But I might point out to noble Lords opposite that, so far as this question is concerned, we are on a par, because even if we were prepared to proceed with the Constitutional question on the lines which they desire instead of upon our lines, if we were going to proceed to discuss as a Government the whole question of the reform of your Lordships' House including the immensely far-reaching subject of the possible application of the principle of the Referendum, if we were going to take that line instead of taking the line of carrying on the Parliament Bill it would be equally impossible for us, in the compass of a single session, to deal by means of a Bill with the relations between Imperial and local finance. Therefore it does not appear to me that there is any subject for recrimination between the two Parties, because when that statement was made and was accepted by noble Lords opposite it was understood that we all hoped to have a clear session in which to deal with it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0139"/>

As the position now stands we arc anxious to make such advance as we can towards dealing with the question. Last year before there was any question of the Dissolution of Parliament, a Committee of Local Government experts had been appointed in order to get together the necessary materials for preparing a measure. Now we propose to proceed further on the same lines. We do not think that it would be advantageous to appoint a further Royal Commission to inquire into the subject. So far as general principles are concerned, they were threshed out, examined, and reported on in the very remarkable Report with which all your Lordships are acquainted of the Commission of 1901. I do not think, as far as the general aspect of the question is concerned, that any improvement could be made upon the Report of that Commission. There are, however, all manner of details which have to be closely considered before it is possible to deal with the whole question, and with that object we propose to appoint a Departmental Committee of a confidential character which will at the same time have the advantage of learning the opinions on the subject of the clerks of county councils and local authorities, as well as those of others. That is the best advance we can make during the present session, and although noble Lords opposite may be prepared to repeat the rather severe strictures of the noble Earl upon our conduct I think that, in their heart of hearts, they will admit that in view of the circumstances of the moment that is as much, from the purely business point of view, that it is possible for us to undertake.<lb/>
The noble Earl subjected to a close examination the efforts which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made to deal with the question so far as it is possible to do so under his present finance proposals, and he accused us of a second breach of faith owing to the fact that we were not handing over to the local authorities half the proceeds of the Land Taxes, but instead, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, we are relieving them of the cost which in the ordinary course would fall upon them in connection with the removal of the pauper disqualification. The noble Earl brushed all that aside, because he assumed that the cost of the removal of the pauper disqualification would in any case have fallen upon Imperial funds. I really
<col>228</col>
do not know what warrant the noble Earl had for that assumption. It was always assumed&#x2014;assumed in public, assumed everywhere&#x2014;that the local authorities would refund to the Imperial Exchequer the sums which they gained by the fact that these old people were no longer set as a burden upon them, and to treat the assumption of that &#x00A3;1,500,000 or &#x00A3;2,000,000 as a pure matter of course and as no real relief to the local authorities is an attitude of mind that I can only qualify as audacious. After all, you have to look at these things in pounds, shillings, and pence, and if, as a matter of fact, the ratepayers are relieved of this sum, as they are going to be, that is a distinct fact which cannot be got over; and it seems to me that the Chancellor of the Exchequer or his representative the Financial Secretary was thoroughly justified in another place in placing that item on the credit side, and the other item, the half-share of the Land Values Duties&#x2014;that is to say, about &#x00A3;250,000 in the first year and about &#x00A3;300,000 in the second year&#x2014;on the debit side.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite has used a common rhetorical device in speaking of the ratepayer. He speaks of the ratepayer at one time meaning one and the whole body of ratepayers, and at another time he speaks of him and uses figures to support his contention when he only means the London ratepayer. who. I quite admit, does not get the full advantage of this particular transaction. That is a matter for separate argument. London may have a grievance to this extent, that under the Land Tax arrangement London would have profited somewhat more than London will profit under the pauper arrangement. I do not think the grievance is a very substantial one, but so far as it is a grievance for the sake of argument let it be admitted. But, of course, in speaking of the ratepayer you must speak of the whole class of ratepayers all over the country. and consider what the advantage is to them. Unless you are prepared to take the attitude of the noble Earl and treat the &#x00A3;1,500,000, or it may be &#x00A3;2,000,000, of the old age pauper figures as something which the ratepayer would claim in any case from the taxpayer&#x2014;unless you are prepared to say that, and treating the ratepayers as a whole class, it seems to me that my right hon. friend is entirely justified in saying that the balance on this special arrangement comes out considerably in favour of the ratepayer.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0140"/>
<col>229</col>
In 1901 it was estimated by the. Royal Commission that the ratepayer had a grievance as against the taxpayer to the tune of about &#x00A3;2,500,000. I do not propose to go into any examination of those figures, but what I think we can venture to say is that this present allocation for this year is an attempt to reduce the grievance of the ratepayer, although we frankly admit that it does not go the whole way, or anything like the whole way. towards a complete settlement of the question. When the noble Earl went on to say that it was an agreed matter that the proceeds of the Land Taxes ought to be the exclusive property of the ratepayer, he was, I think, entering upon very controversial ground. It is, no doubt, sometimes argued that the particular gain in the way of increment which the land owner receives is due to the exertions of those in the immediate district, and that therefore if the tax is to be imposed at all that they should receive the benefit. But we all know that, as a matter of fact, that is by no means invariably true. There are a great many cases in which it is the precise opposite of truth. There is no need to multiply instances. In the county in which I live&#x2014;in Cheshire&#x2014;there are quarters where land has appreciated to an enormous extent and become. extremely valuable owing to the fact that people who carry on business in Lancashire in some cases, and in other cases in Staffordshire, have chosen to occupy the more attractive portion of Cheshire as a residential quarter. It is impossible to say, whatever your views may be about increment taxes, that those particular increments are due to the exertion of the local authority in the particular district.<lb/>
I could go further. There are many such cases round London. There are other cases where the increment is due to the exertions and to the business enterprise of a railway company. I suppose in strict justice, if justice in such things were possible, or strict equity, the proceeds ought to go to the shareholders of the railway company; but, as we know, it is impossible to enter into <i>minuti&#x0153;</i> of that kind. I merely quote this instance to show that we and a good many others are not prepared to admit the <i>dictum</i> which the noble Earl laid down with so much certainty&#x2014;that it was a matter of general agreement that the proceeds of the increment tax ought to go to the local authority immediately concerned. That is, in our view, a justification of the course
<col>230</col>
which my right hon. friend has taken in this year ear-marking these taxes for the general purse instead of handing them over to the local authorities. I do not know that any useful purpose would be served by my entering further into the whole subject. I quite admit that the arrangement for this year is, and must be a provisional arrangement, for the reasons which I have endeavoured to explain; but it must not be supposed that we do not recognise to the full quite as much as noble Lords opposite, the importance and urgency of the whole question, including, among other things, the question of areas. This is a very difficult question and one which we must all admit is in a condition of no little confusion. It will be a long and a serious matter to get it put thoroughly right, but I hope that the steps we are taking will do something towards that, and that when we have cleared away these larger obstructive questions we may be in a position finally to deal with it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00743"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise at once to express my concurrence and that of my friends who sit near me in what was said by the noble Earl as to the loss which this House has sustained by the death of Lord Wolverhampton. Lord Wolverhampton came to this House at a time when he no longer possessed those brilliant Parliamentary qualities which earned for him such well-deserved reputation in the House of Commons; but for all that there was not one of us who did not feel that his presence added distinction to this Assembly. We sincerely respected him, and we listened with attention to any words that fell from him in the course of debate. We desire to join our sympathy with that which the noble Earl has expressed for those who are mourning for him.<lb/>
With regard to the matter which my noble friend behind me has brought before the House in a speech, if I may be permitted to say so, of very great clearness and ability, I desire to say a few words only. It is hardly unfair to say that there really is no defence to the charge which my noble friend has brought against His Majesty's Government. There is a plea for extenuating circumstances, but no real defence as to the facts. I do not suppose that in the history of Parliament more categorical pledges or distinct undertakings
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0141"/>
<col>231</col>
were ever given than the undertaking given, on the one hand. by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons, and, on the other, by the noble Earl speaking from his place in this House. The noble Earl chooses his words carefully, and he told us definitely&#x2014;that was the word he used&#x2014;that this question would be dealt with during the next session of Parliament; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer added to that an assurance that the question should not only be dealt with but dealt with thoroughly.<lb/>
What is the noble Earl's explanation? He tells us that in the month of July the Constitutional Conference was sitting, and that he was at that time so hopeful of the result that lie was able to announce arrangements founded upon the assumption that this year we should have what he described, as a clear session. I was one of those who shared to some extent the hopes of the noble Earl&#x2014;and I desire to be careful in anything that I say not to add to the unauthorised statements which have lately appeared in reference to what happened, or what did not happen, at the Conference&#x2014;but I cannot say that I ever felt so absolutely sanguine of the result of our deliberations that I should have thought myself at liberty to allot Parliamentary time twelve months ahead in the confident belief that the discussions of the Conference were bound to clear away the whole of the great Constitutional difficulties which had been remitted to our consideration. The noble Earl must not be surprised if, in these circumstances, a very considerable feeling of irritation&#x2014;I would almost say exasperation&#x2014;has been produced in the minds of the local authorities who were encouraged to look forward to this relief. I think I correctly describe what took place in the House of Commons last year when I say that there was nothing that went so far towards smoothing the passage of the Land Taxes through that House as the assurance that half the proceeds of those taxes was to go into the pockets of the local authorities. For these Land Taxes were the invention of the local authorities; they had their origin, I fancy, with some Scottish local authorities with which my noble friend behind me is familiar; and it was the assurance that part of the spoils at any rate, was to go into the pockets of the local authorities that placated a good many of the opponents of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's proposal.<lb/>
<col>232</col>
My noble friend has shown with considerable success that the solatium which is offered to the local authorities is not by any means adequate. I am not sufficiently conversant with the figures to follow that question in detail. I would only point this out, that in a good many of the calculations which I have heard made there seems to be this fallacy. It is assumed that because the old age pensions which will be payable in consequence of the removal of the pauper disqualification represent a certain sum, that sum is the measure of the relief to the ratepayers. That is entirely fallacious. The ratepayers remain saddled with their establishment charges, their fixed charges, and so forth, so that the &#x00A3;1,500,000 assumed by the taxpayers of the country is by no means &#x00A3;1,500,000 put into the pockets of the ratepayers. I must say that to many of us it does seem most unfortunate that this opportunity should have been missed for dealing with a subject which both sides regard as one of the greatest possible urgency. I say we are missing an opportunity because I believe it is a matter of notoriety that His Majesty's Government will probably be in the fortunate position of having a large surplus to dispose of. They might, therefore, have given this much needed relief. We can have no assurance that they will be in an equally fortunate position another year. Nor personally do I derive very much comfort from the announcement that this matter is to be referred to a Departmental Committee. I should, however, like to be assured, if the matter is to go to a Departmental Committee, that the Committee will be instructed to find the means of giving effect to the pledges given by Ministers last year, and that they will not merely be given a roving commission to inquire into a subject which has many ramifications and which lends itself to almost indefinite investigation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00744"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to detain your Lordships, but I would like to reply to one remark made by the noble Earl who leads the House. The noble Earl complained of my taking the figures of London in order to prove the case as regards the ratepayers of the whole of the country. I strictly stated that 1 was not presenting the case for London. It is true that in dealing with the figures presented to the House of Commons by Mr. Hobhouse I did take the case of London to disprove
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0142"/>
<col>233</col>
the balance which Mr. Hobhouse arrived at, but I took the figures for London because I happened to be in a position to obtain those figures with greater accuracy than I could obtain them with regard to the whole country. Mr. Hobhouse claimed a balance in favour of the local authorities throughout the United Kingdom on the whole of this transaction of &#x00A3;40,000 a year. I have shown that, in the ease of London alone, there is a balance on the wrong side against the local authorities of &#x00A3;130,000 a year; and I take it that on that showing it is extremely improbable&#x2014;in fact, it is impossible&#x2014;that for the local authorities throughout the United Kingdom there can be any credit balance.<lb/>
The noble Earl took some exception to my claim that the proceeds of the duties on Land Values should go to the local communities. I gave that as my own opinion. My case was in no way connected with my opinion. My case was that a bargain was struck between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the ratepayers throughout the country that one-half of the proceeds of the Land Taxes should be paid to the local authorities. If I might put it a little stronger, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in order to obtain sufficient support for his Budget in the country, made this bargain with the local authorities who were opposed to the Budget in order to get their consent and support. As regards the &#x00A3;1,500,000 which the noble Earl said I had practically given the Government no credit for, I give them full credit for that amount, but I still claim that, taking the effect of all the legislation which has been passed by the present Government and taking the relief afforded to the rates by the &#x00A3;1,500,000, there still remains a great loss to the ratepayers throughout the whole of the country.<lb/>
It was with great regret and disappointment that I listened to the statement of the noble Earl. The only advance His Majesty's Government can give us is that they are going to appoint another Committee of Inquiry. A Royal Commission, admittedly strong and representative of many different views, sat for some five years inquiring into this same matter. I might remind the House that if the recommendations of the Majority Report had been carried out, there would have been something like &#x00A3;2,500,000 of extra grants for the local authorities; and if the recommendations of the Minority
<col>234</col>
Report had been carried out, there would have been something like &#x00A3;1,500,000 in increased subventions. This was several years ago. The position of local authorities is far worse now than it was then. In these circumstances I am disappointed that His Majesty's Government can find no further help than appointing another Committee to inquire into the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SIR. A. K. WILSON'S MEMORANDUM.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00746"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member> rose to ask the Lord Privy Seal whether the words attributed to the First Lord of the Admiralty in <i>The Times</i> of 22nd February. in reply to Lord Hugh Cecil, are correct: "If any member submits to me a document and I approve it, that document has the approval of the Board of Admiralty"; and, if so, whether the words "the approval of the Board of Admiralty" are meant to have the same force in this connection as "a decision of the Board of Admiralty" taken at a formal meeting of the Board and, if so, whether he will lay on the Table the Orders in Council or other official documents establishing this rule.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00747">The noble Earl said: My Lords. I thought it would be more convenient if I postponed this Question from yesterday, when your Lordships' time was more fully occupied, until to-day, and I understood that the noble Earl the Leader of the House was not averse to that course. I have put down my Question in this form for two reasons. I want to have the opportunity, in asking it, of allaying what I think may be a public misapprehension arising from the answer of the First Lord of the Admiralty in the House of Commons, and I want to point out to His Majesty's Government the grave and serious inconvenience that I think has been caused by the precedent they have set up in connection with this document which had the approval of the First Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00748">The First Lord of the Admiralty said, in answer to a Question&#x2014;and I assume that the answer has been correctly reported&#x2014;
<quote>"If any member submits to me a document and I approve it, that document has the approval of the Board of Admiralty."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00749">Now, that is quite true, and yet it is untrue. A quorum of the Board of Admiralty is
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0143"/>
<col>235</col>
technically two members and the secretary, and therefore if one member of the Board brings to the First Lord a document of which he approves, and it is countersigned by the secretary, that document may be said to have the approval of the Board of Admiralty. But that rule only exists for matters of convenience. In the great routine of business for which the Admiralty is responsible it would be most inconvenient if every document going out with the authority of the Board had to be signed by every member of the Board and countersigned by the secretary. But in my experience it never applies to any matter of real importance. Take the Estimates. What would the House of Commons say if the Estimates were laid on the Table signed by two members of the Board of Admiralty only Why, they would send them back at once, and say, Why have not the other members signed? That is only an indication of the truth of what I say. While it is very convenient that matters of routine and of comparative unimportance can be dealt with on the authority of two members of the Board of Admiralty, I altogether protest against that process being applied to a matter of importance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00750">Now I come to the question, Was this or was this not a matter of importance? Before I consider that, let me point out how delicate is the position in our Constitution of the Sea Lords. The duty of a sailor all through his career, whether his functions are administrative or executive, is to obey the orders of his superiors. But at the moment in his career when he becomes a Sea Lord his functions change. He becomes an adviser, one of the constitutional advisers of the Government of the day on all matters that affect the administration of the Admiralty. It is not an easy task to fulfil with complete satisfaction. Very often a Sea Lord must be content to find himself overruled by the Cabinet. He will give advice which is not followed. He will have a policy decided upon of which he does not altogether approve. But in nine cases out of ten&#x2014;indeed, in many more than that&#x2014;his constitutional function and his duty will have been satisfied by his having given the best advice in his power, and lie will remain a Sea Lord and carry out the policy although he does not entirely agree with it,. But I am not to be supposed to mean that a Sea Lord should, in my opinion, never resort to resignation. I think there are cases&#x2014;happily they have not occurred within
<col>236</col>
my own experience, but I can imagine them&#x2014;when a Sea Lord would feel it incompatible with his duty and self-respect to continue any longer to occupy that position. I mention that to show how delicate the position of the Sea Lord is; how he never should be obtruded into politics; how lie never should take part in Party politics; how even he should conceal his opinion in the majority of cases when the Government of the day are not taking his advice; though I do not admit that there could not be circumstances in which I should think he was doing his duty best by his country by refusing to continue in the position of a Sea Lord. That is the position of the Sea Lord, and although I have no personal knowledge of the constitution of the Army Council, I imagine the position of the military members of the Army Council is much the same.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00751">What is the position of His Majesty's Government towards these Sea Lords? They have the right to ask for the personal opinion of the Sea Lords. I do not deny that, but I do deny that a Government have the right to publish their notes as the opinion of the Board of Admiralty. Why should they? They can always go to the Board of Admiralty and ask for their opinion, formally and constitutionally. The Government have a perfect right to ask for the opinion of the Board of Admiralty, and it is quite clear that it is the duty of the Board of Admiralty in its corporate capacity to give the best advice it can on any subject referred to it. It can only rest with the Government of the day whether that advice is to be published or not. They alone can at any moment be the judges of the public interest in the matter. But what I want to lay stress upon is this, that if on great matters of State the opinion of the Sea Lords or military members of the Army Council is to be made public, there is only one constitutional way in which that should be done, and that is by the Government of the day seeking the formal advice of the Board of Admiralty or the Army Council and then laying that opinion before Parliament. In this case I do not know what the opinion of the Army Council, on the one hand, or of the Board of Admiralty on the other may be. Surely nothing could have been easier than for the Government to get an expression of opinion on the subjects concerned and to publish them.</p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0144"/>
<col>237</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00752">But what have the Government done? They have published the opinion of two individual very important Sea Lord, an officer for whom every one of your Lordships has the most profound respect, and an ex-Adjutant-General. I have no reason to assume that the opinions of these two officers do not reflect the corporate opinions of the bodies to which they belong, or recently belonged, but I am entitled to assume that it might not be so. I do assume, for the purposes of this question, that there may be a Sea Lord on the one hand who takes a different view, though I think it very unlikely, and I do assume that there may be a military member of the Army Council who takes a different view from the military view published in the pamphlet to which Sir Arthur Wilson's notes form an appendix. But if there are such, are the Government going to allow their views to he made known in a rival pamphlet? I can conceive no precedent more detrimental to the public service. But on what grounds would they refuse permission? That is the point which I earnestly want to lay before His Majesty's Government and ask them to consider. Have they not set a dangerous and unconstitutional precedent? It seems to me that what was done was lightly done, and that the ulterior consequences were not thought out. It would have been perfectly legitimate, as I have said, to lay the views of the Board of Admiralty or of the Army Council before Parliament. His Majesty's Government have a perfect right to do that, and it may sometimes be their duty to do so. But I do protest against the inevitable result of this unfortunate precedent which has been set&#x2014;namely, the danger of dragging great expert naval and military advisers into the political arena. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00753"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has asked his Question in terms of great moderation, and we all recognise the authority with which he speaks as a former head of the Admiralty. Although I have never been in either of the Departments concerned, I will endeavour to the best of my ability to give an answer to the Question. The remarks of my right hon. friend the First Lord were made in another place in reply to a supplementary question, and, as I think the noble Earl clearly understood, were simply intended to refer to the established procedure of the Admiralty by which
<col>238</col>
two of the Lords Commissioners executing the office of Lord High Admiral are empowered to act for the Board. As everybody knows, for the discussion of current business full meetings of the Board are held, and, so far as ordinary business is concerned, no departure has been made from the established practice in the matter.<lb/>
But as regards the particular question of the Memorandum on which the noble Earl has founded his observations, there is this point to be considered, that in these matters the practice of the Admiralty and of the War Office is different. Memoranda issued by, the Admiralty always appear anonymously; Memoranda issued by the War Office habitually appear under the signature of one of the members of the Army Council; and in this instance this particular Memorandum was supplied for use in a debate in this House. It was intended to be for my use, in the first instance, in a debate which has not yet taken place, but which is to take place, I understand, later on, on the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts. That Memorandum was supplied to the War Office, and in being issued was issued in the War Office manner with the initials of the First Sea Lord. I am not quite sure whether the noble Earl complains that the Memorandum was issued under initials, or that it was issued at all. He can hardly complain that it was issued under initials because that makes it clear that, although it was issued by the authority of the Board of Admiralty, it represents the stated views of the First Sea Lord.<lb/>
Rather, I understand, the noble Earl objects to the First Sea Lord having issued a Memorandum at all. I do not find myself in any general agreement with the noble Earl opposite. There is a great deal to be said for preserving complete anonymity in these matters, and for leaving, so far as possible, individual opinions out of controversy. But I would ask the House to consider what happens with regard to these questions of national defence. On the opposite side you find that officers of both Services on the active list write, speak, and are freely quoted in support of particular views. No officer on the active list, be he Field-Marshal or anybody else, has any right to criticise the policy of the Government of the day. That is a rule which cannot in all its fulness be adhered to, but if it is going to be broken with the freedom with which it is habitually broken, it is not
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0145"/>
<col>239</col>
inadvisable, I think, that opinions of other officers of distinction who for the time being hold office under the Government should be placed before the country. To that extent, and to that extent only. I think in this one particular matter of national defence it is not unreasonable to depart from that rule of anonymity which we all agree in every department of the public service ought to be scrupulously maintained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00754"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one detail which appears to me to have been omitted from this discussion, and that is that any ordinary member of the public, on seeing that a document had been submitted to the Admiralty and approved, would think that it had received the approval of some, at any rate, of the Sea Lords of the Admiralty. Yet we understand that a document submitted by the Civil Lord of the Admiralty to the First Lord, and without any seaman, either at the Admiralty or elsewhere, having been consulted at all, would pass to the general public as a document having received the approval of the Board of Admiralty. I think it is a misfortune that such a misconception should continue, and I think it ought to be made clear on what occasions the opinions receive the approval of the Sea Lords. At the present moment a document of that sort may be published without a single sailor of any experience having been consulted at all. The Sea Lords should not have that heavy additional burden placed on their shoulders.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00755"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think this subject is one of rather more importance than the noble Earl the Leader of the House appeared to think in the remarks which he addressed to your Lordships. Every one who has had experience of the Admiralty knows perfectly well that the doctrine which the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, laid down from his experience as First Lord of the Admiralty undoubtedly expresses the correct theory of what the Board of Admiralty is; but the noble Earl did not, I think, sufficiently go into the details of this matter.<lb/>
This question arises in the following way. There has been laid on your Lordships' Table a Command Paper entitled "Notes supplied by the Admiralty"&#x2014;not by a person who puts his initials to them, but by the Admiralty&#x2014;"for the use of the War Office in a debate which was to have taken place in November, 1910." In the
<col>240</col>
first instance, I ask your Lordships whether any of you remember a Paper put forward in such a form as that. There is no doubt of this, that Lord Roberts and a body known as the National Service League entertain very strong opinions on this matter, and His Majesty's Government entertain very strong opinions on the other side. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal intended to raise this matter in a debate. That was just at the close of last session and Parliament was about to prorogue, and therefore it was not convenient for the noble Earl at that time to raise the debate. Very likely he may be going to do so later; but surely the Government might have left their defence until they had heard what he had to say. Instead of that they print, not a posthumous, but an untimely-born Memorandum of this sort alluding to a debate which was to have taken place, and which, as the noble Earl tells us, is going to take place hereafter. In other words, they have given their answer to Lord Roberts before Lord Roberts has told them what he has to say.<lb/>
The noble Earl said that this Memorandum was supplied in the first instance above the initials "A.K.W.," the initials of Sir Arthur K. Wilson, who, as we all know, is a very distinguished officer and one who enjoys very largely the confidence of the Navy. I have heard that one of the reasons why he enjoys the confidence of his brother officers and of the Service is that he is very much opposed to anything like publication or advertisement or anything of that kind. I wonder when he wrote this Minute whether he was told that this use as going to be made of it. The noble Earl has told us that there is no, objection to Sir Arthur Wilson's Minute because it was published with his initials. What I object to is that when it appears in this Paper his initials are not there. I have in my hand a book, and Sir Arthur Wilson's Memorandum is published at the end of the Book, and it is perfectly true that the initials "A.K.W." appear there.<lb/>
I think I can show your Lordships the reasons which caused this Minute to be published. It was published for the purpose of aiding the defence of the War Office against Lord Roberts. The book that I hold in my hand originated with the Secretary of State for War, who is very much opposed to compulsory service, of which Lord Roberts, I believe, is in favour.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0146"/>
<col>241</col>
The Minister for War asked Sir Ian Hamilton, of course knowing his opinions with regard to compulsory service perfectly well, to write what his opinions were. Sir Ian Hamilton did so. Mr. Haldane then says&#x2014;
<quote>"I have thought it right to publish this Memorandum, written for me by one who has very recently been Adjutant-General. It is an unofficial document originally prepared for my private information."</quote>
Up to this point Sir Ian Hamilton gives his private and unofficial opinion. Mr. Haldane then proceeds to give his private, and I do not know whether official or unofficial opinion, and publishes it in the form of this book. The first edition of the book appears not to have had a very large circulation. Then out comes the second edition, and at the end of the book as it then appeared is this Minute of Sir Arthur Wilson's, with Sir Arthur's initials at the bottom of it. But listen to how Mr. Haldane describes it&#x2014;
<quote>"In Appendix V111, I have, with their permission, printed the notes supplied by the Board of Admiralty for the use of the War Office in a debate which was to have taken place last November."</quote>
The Secretary of State says it was supplied "by the Board of Admiralty." He quotes it as an official Minute. Which is it? Is it official or is it unofficial? It cannot be both. In the form in which it is given to your Lordships it certainly appears to be an official Paper coming from the Board of Admiralty, because the initials "A.K.W." do not appear.<lb/>
The noble Earl said, very truly. that it is not allowed to officers in high places to criticise the Government. Then does it come to this, that the Secretary of State for War or the First Lord of the Admiralty may call upon an individual officer to write his opinions and may print them as official, and yet at the same time exercise his discretion and not call upon any officers who might not agree with him? At the Board of Admiralty and the War Office there are, no doubt, differences of opinion among various members. But the Secretary of State does not call upon any of those who disagree with him to write their opinions&#x2014;not a bit. He then puts forward these views, and adds a Minute written by a member of the Board of Admiralty which he calls "the opinion of the Board of Admiralty" and publishes it in that form. I venture to think that that is a very unjustifiable method of procedure.<lb/>
<col>242</col>
I object to the mode which the War Office has of defending its proceedings. When debates have been raised in this House we have listened to speeches which, though very able speeches, do not seem to some of us to relate very closely to the facts of the case. It really has come to this, that by a sort of system of question and answer, invented largely by the Duke of Bedford, we manage finally to extract certain figures which are by no means favourable to the Territorial Force or to the conditions at the War Office. But then what is the line which the War Office take? They do not go into the facts much in this House. The-Secretary of State makes speeches in the country; he writes books and quotes Minutes which are not official and yet calls-them official. The War Office prefer that mode of defending themselves. I must say I never heard of a Sea Lord writing a. Minute of this kind and printing it, or allowing it to be printed, as if it were the opinion of the Board of Admiralty.<lb/>
The First Lord of the Admiralty appears to me to be rather inclined to treat his Board as a set of dummies. Only yesterday, in the House of Commons, Mr. McKenna was asked if the Board of Admiralty sits regularly or only occasionally; if it is still a consulting and deliberative body to which all important questions of naval policy and administration are submitted; and if the Board records agreement or disagreement with the questions submitted to the Board. Mr. McKenna replied&#x2014;
<quote>"At the discretion of the First Lord, the Board of Admiralty meets from time to time to consult and deliberate on important questions of naval policy and administration."</quote>
Is the whole question of the purpose of our Fleet an important question? Yet this Minute was dismissed without any meeting of the Board, and was published simply on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of one member of the Board. Then the following question was put to Mr. McKenna&#x2014;
<quote>"Will the right hon. gentleman answer the first part of my question: Whether the Board of Admiralty sits regularly or only occasionally?"</quote>
Mr. McKenna replied&#x2014;
<quote>"I said from time to time."</quote>
It therefore appears that this procedure on the part of the Board of Admiralty, under which a Minute is signed by only two members of the Board, is by no means so exceptional as it used to be during the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0147"/>
<col>243</col>
tenure of office of my noble friend Lord Selborne. I should like to know whether Mr. McKenna authorised the production of this matter, and whether he approved of the Minute being published in this book. I can hardly imagine that he can have been very much obliged to his colleague for printing this official or unofficial Minute in this sort of way.<lb/>
If this be the constitution of the Board of Admiralty, pray what is the constitution of the Army Council? Are they a set of dummies? Sir Ian Hamilton is asked to give his opinion. It is well known what his opinion is. Well, but what is the opinion of the other members of the Army Council? I imagine we must look at this book as the private production of Mr. Haldane and Sir Ian Hamilton. What I object to is that in a case of this sort there should be appended a Minute which the publisher of the book says proceeds from the Board of Admiralty. I think this precedent is a most awkward one, and I hope it will never be repeated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00756"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the speech of the noble Earl opposite and the admission which he made that he was not otherwise than generally in accord with the remarks made by my noble friend, it is rather difficult to pursue this matter. But certain points have arisen which seem to me so likely to discredit the whole belief in the statements of the Board of Admiralty and of the Army Council that I think we ought to clear them up before we leave the subject. The noble Earl told us that this special document, so far as it affected the Admiralty, simply conveyed the opinion of Sir Arthur Wilson. whose initials are at the bottom of it; but, as Lord Camper-down has just pointed out, that very opinion is in an official Paper laid before Parliament, headed "Views of the Admiralty." It must be one thing or the other. Either it conveys the views of Sir Arthur Wilson&#x2014;and we have riot yet heard whether Sir Arthur Wilson consented to its publication&#x2014;or it conveys the views of the Board of Admiralty, in which case it is, of course, at the option of the Board of Admiralty whether it shall be published or not.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, asked earlier in the evening, When is a promise not a promise? I feel inclined to ask,
<col>244</col>
When is the First Lord of the Admiralty the Board of Admiralty and when is he not the Board of Admiralty? and to go a little further and ask a similar question with regard to the Secretary of State for War. Nothing has been said as regards this important point&#x2014;Why was this publication permitted at all, and has the Secretary of State the power to authorise the publication or has he not? All power, according to the King's Regulations, in such a matter rests with the Army Council except in matters which the Secretary of State for War specially reserves to himself, and it has always been customary to treat the King's Regulations as guiding every man, including the Secretary of State.<lb/>
If the House will pardon me I will call attention to three of the Regulations which bear specially upon this matter. By Regulation 453 an officer or soldier is&#x2014;
<quote>"forbidden to publish or communicate, either directly or indirectly, to the Press any military information or his views on any military subject without special authority."</quote>
That special authority, we must assume, was given by the Secretary of State's prologue at the beginning of the book, but I very much doubt whether anything of the kind was contemplated by the Regulation, or whether there is any precedent for anything of the kind ever having been done before. Later on the same Regulation specially states that&#x2014;
<quote>"an officer is not to prejudge questions which are under the consideration of his superior military authority by the publication, anonymously or otherwise, of his opinions, and he is not to take part in public in a discussion relating to orders, regulations, or instructions issued by his superiors."</quote>
It is impossible to write a book of the kind in question without discussing, in public, orders, regulations, and instructions issued by superiors. And that brings us at once to the question put by the noble Earl behind me&#x2014;Would an officer who desired to write on the opposite side to Sir Ian Hamilton be allowed to do so? It is an important question. I do not say I would defend it, but I think we ought to be told whether this stretching of this regulation, which was obviously intended to be a deterrent, is only to be permitted when an officer is prepared to write on the side of the Secretary of State and is not to be allowed if he wishes to criticise the view which the Secretary of State has taken.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0148"/>
<col>245</col>
Then there is Regulation 443, which lays it down that discussions by officers or soldiers with the object of conveying praise, censure, or any mark of approbation in regard to their superiors or any others in His Majesty's Service are prohibited. How is it possible to write a book like this, teaming with remarks, I will not say derogatory to, but depreciating the conclusions of those who differ from the Secretary of State, and lauding one after another each of the expedients which the Secretary of State has put forward and which have been denounced by Lord Roberts, without using laudatory remarks about your superiors which is forbidden by the Regulations? I wish to say a word on the selection of one distinguished officer who had been only a few weeks before a member of the Army Council to convey opinions on which it is very probable there is disagreement in the Army Council. Let me say that I have not had any communication, directly or indirectly, either since this book was published or before, with any man in the War Office with regard to this or any other question. I do not deny Sir Ian Hamilton's very high qualifications for command, or the deserved approbation which he has obtained in all the commands he has held and in all the posts he has filled; but h deny Sir Ian Hamilton's right to be selected by the Secretary of State as a person of peculiar knowledge as Adjutant-General on this particular subject. There is hardly a soldier in a high position in the Army or of his eminence who has spent less time in the War Office and has less knowledge of the details of the subject of recruiting than Sir Ian Harnilton. And when I remember that there are present in the War Office at this moment officers like the Chief of the General Staff, Sir William Nicholson, who has written, I suppose, this book several times over in Minutes on this very question, I think the country has some right to complain that we are given the opinion of one distinguished officer unchecked by those with whom he was serving some time before. That is the inconvenience I see in this. I do not say that there has been any attempt to muzzle any one, but I do suggest that this is a most inconvenient precedent, and I hope the fact that this discussion has taken place and that public attention has been called to it. will prevent its ever being followed.</membercontribution></p>
<col>246</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00757"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRASSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of continuing the discussion on questions of official rule and precedent. The observations I shall venture to offer will be directed to general considerations. In the circumstances of the hour the publication of Sir Arthur Wilson's Minute was not, I would submit, ill-timed. Public confidence has been rudely shaken. It has been contended that our naval supremacy is gone or going, that we are open to invasion, that we are unable to assure the safety of our communications across the seas. All this has been discouraging to the burdened taxpayer.<lb/>
Parliament has been liberal in votes for the Navy. In the ten years, 1901&#x2013;10, our expenditure exceeded &#x00A3;338,000,000, as against &#x00A3;134,000,000 for Germany. Vindication of Admiralty policy was needed. It has been given by Sir Arthur Wilson. He speaks with authority. As he shows&#x2014;and it is well that it should be shown&#x2014;our expenditure in the past has not been misapplied. We are assured&#x2014;and it is good to have the assurance&#x2014;that if there were danger, and surely there never was a more imaginary danger, of an invasion from the other side of the North Sea, the Admiralty has somewhere within wireless call nearly double the number of battleships and cruisers that the officer leading the attack could muster. It is well to know that as an inner line of defence we have our destroyers and submarines stationed along the coast. It has been our policy to push the construction of submarines and to improve the type.<lb/>
Once more, my Lords, our naval administration has not been inefficient. Other Powers may strengthen their battle line more rapidly in proportion to the sums voted. The conditions are not identical. The charge for manning the British Navy necessarily shows an excess as compared with foreign countries. We man our ships with volunteers, and we have a large preponderance in the number of permanent men. If Parliament votes men, ships must be commissioned. Our naval training is on a scale not approached elsewhere. With us expenditure on construction cannot be concentrated on battleships. Half the world's tonnage is under our national flag. The Admiralty is responsible for its protection. Our strength in first-class cruisers measured by dis-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0149"/>
<col>247</col>
placement is equal to the combined cruiser force of the United States, France, Germany, and Japan. Works involve a heavy charge. The extensions in our home yards constitute a burden which we have to bear in common with other countries. In addition, we have our vast expenditure on distant yards in foreign stations. No similar charge lies on foreign administrations. We should have an advantage in time of war. When we take into view all the responsibilities of the British Admiralty, it cannot be contended that any of our defensive preparations have been uncalled for or their cost excessive.<lb/>
My Lords, if we are strong to-day, we have to maintain our position. In new construction, as the Returns laid before Parliament have shown, we had in recent years been falling behind. The instinct of self-preservation has compelled us to renewed exertions. For a time&#x2014;and we hope for a short time only&#x2014;they must be sustained. We must be prepared for increased Estimates for the Navy. Encouraged by the assurances lately given, Parliament will not refuse the needful supplies, and if in any degree the Paper which has been under criticism should discourage the ill-timed movement for cutting down the Estimates, its publication will not have been in vain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00758"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to say anything upon the matter which the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, directly raised in his notice on the Paper&#x2014;namely, the Admiralty Memorandum&#x2014;but rather for the purpose of answering one or two remarks on the question as affecting the War Office and the Army Council. First of all, I think a certain amount of confusion of thought exists with regard to the position of Sir Ian Hamilton in writing for my right hon. friend the Memorandum which is published in this book. Sir Ian Hamilton was not a member of the Army Council when he wrote it, nor, if he had been, does it necessarily follow that he wrote it in his capacity as a member of the Army Council. He wrote it in his position as ex-Adjutant General who, by virtue of that position, was in close touch with the most practical sides of the questions involved in the subject under discussion; and it was not written, as is plainly stated, in any sense as an
<col>248</col>
Army Council's Memorandum, nor does it purport in any way to represent the views of the Army Council. Therefore, the question of the responsibility of the Army Council with regard to it does not come in under that head. The responsibility, if the Army Council comes in at all, arises in regard to the publication of the document. I do not know that that point has been raised. But I would only say that the propriety of authorising publication is completely covered by the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by the. Order in Council issued when noble Lords opposite were in power&#x2014;the Letters Patent and the Order in Council which brought the Army Council into existence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00759"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Lord this practical question. If at this moment an officer on full pay were to reply to Mr. Haldane's book, would that matter be dealt with by the Secretary of State alone, or would not the Adjutant-General be the person who would be forced to give the Secretary of State his advice before the Secretary of State dealt with it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00760"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I will deal with that in a moment. The noble Viscount commented on Sir Ian Hamilton's capacity for writing on this subject. On that I would sooner leave the Memorandum to speak for itself. My own view is that the Memorandum will take a great deal of answering, and that Sir Ian Hamilton's career specially fits him in an all-round way for dealing with the complex questions, which must be to a great extent theoretical, as to what the effect of the proposed alterations is going to be. I come now to the question of the advisability of the policy of permitting publication, in view of the general prohibition, which the noble Viscount has quoted, in the King's Regulations against publishing views on military subjects without authority. To that I would reply that if we have erred at all in this matter, we have been too lenient in permitting the publication by officers on the active list of views which we did not ourselves hold. The noble Viscount asked whether any officer who conies under the terms of the Regulation which he quoted had been permitted to publish views which are not held by us. I would refer, as the most obvious case, to the case of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, who is, by virtue of being a
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0150"/>
<col>249</col>
Field-Marshal, an officer on the active list. We have never interfered, and should not dream of interfering, with his publishing the views he holds. Nevertheless, the fact that Lord Roberts does speak and write in favour of national service is an infringement of Article 453 of the Royal Warrant. But, as I say, we do not for a moment attempt to prevent his doing it. We do not attempt to prevent other people in his position from doing it; but had we exercised the full powers which we undoubtedly have under the King's Regulations, the necessity for publishing this book would not have arisen. It is due to the fact, that. these publications have already taken place that my right hon. friend the Secretary of State thought that the time had come when sonic sort of rejoinder should be made, and undoubtedly when you are going to make a rejoinder the best thing to do on a subject of this kind is to take the opinions of people who can give you actual official experience on the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00761"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I put the question with regard to an officer attacking the view of the Secretary of State, and I am replied to by the noble Lord citing the case of Lord Roberts. But the noble and gallant Field-Marshal writes as a private individual, although he is still on the active list. Does the noble Lord contend that Sir Ian Hamilton wrote as a private individual when he wrote not Merely under the &#x0153;gis of the Secretary of
<col>250</col>
State, but quoted an official document of the Admiralty which is not known to the public and which is only made known to the public through this book</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00762"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I was not attempting to reply upon anything the noble Viscount said with regard to the Admiralty Memorandum, as I thought that the whole of that ground had been sufficiently covered by my noble friend the Leader of the House. What I was attempting to answer was the point which the noble Viscount raised as to how far it is either expedient or legal for officers on the active list to be allowed to make publications on a subject of this kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00763"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have only one word to say in reply. I certainly do not regret having brought forward this subject. It seems to me that the question can be put in a nutshell. If Sir Ian Hamilton's Memorandum embodies the views of the Army Council, why could not the Army Council endorse it and have it published as their opinion in the form of a Parliamentary Paper? In the same way, if Sir Arthur Wilson's views are those of the Board of Admiralty, the proper and only Constitutional course was to have them communicated to Parliament as the views of the Board of Admiralty in a Parliamentary Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00790"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise, pursuant to notice, to present a Bill to provide for the taking of a poll of the Parliamentary electors of the United Kingdom with respect to certain Bills in Parliament and for other purposes connected therewith. I have given notice that I proposed to introduce this Bill because I thought that the proposals contained in it were of sufficient importance to justify me in explaining them to the House and the reasons which have induced me to present the Bill, and that it would be for the convenience of your Lordships that I should do so now rather than wait for the Second Reading. I have every hope that the. Bill itself will be in the hands of members of the House to-morrow morning. I wish to make it perfectly distinct that I, and I alone, am responsible for the contents of this Bill. I hope that it will meet with a certain amount of favour, but think it due to noble Lords who might otherwise be supposed to be responsible for it to say that, whether it be good, bad, or indifferent, whether it receives the favour of your Lordships' House or not, at any rate at this stage I, and I alone, am responsible for the course that I am asking you to take.<lb/>
This is not a new subject. In one form or another it has been before the country for a considerable number of years, and I am sanguine enough to think that the ideas that underlie it have been gaining in public favour, and that I do not put matters too high when I say that in my belief something on the lines of this proposal will be found to be the best solution of many of the undoubted difficulties in which we find ourselves. To carry a change of this kind, which, after all, is a considerable change, into law may not be
<col>254</col>
altogether an easy matter, but it will solve a great many difficulties, and will, perhaps, create fewer difficulties than any other proposal which has been suggested. With me it is no new matter. As your Lordships know, I put a Notice on the Paper of the House last May winch would have raised in an abstract form a discussion on this subject, but on account of melancholy events with which we are all familiar, it was never convenient to bring that Notice to the test of public discussion. Personally I greatly regret, and I do not think 1 am alone in regretting, that events over which most of us had no control prevented any adequate discussion, not only of this question but of other matters, before the Dissolution of Parliament was announced to your Lordships.<lb/>
I am one of those who can say with truth that when we were told that a Conference on the Constitutional question was agreed upon we received that announcement with unfeigned rejoicing, and hoped that it would lead to a successful result, and I am perfectly certain that we never realised that two things were going to happen: first, that when that. Conference failed a Dissolution would be sprung upon us without any opportunity for discussion; and, secondly, that we should be kept in absolute ignorance of the points discussed in the Conference. I venture to say that those who claim the title, which I arrogate to myself, of being moderate and reasonable in these matters, have been prejudiced by the fact that we have not been told what were the subjects which finally made agreement insuperable. I do not go further into that at the moment, but I do feel very strongly on that point.<lb/>
I have thought it important to show in actual form what is meant by the measure hitherto designated by the somewhat barbarous title of the Referendum. I propose to call it reference to the people, and the Bill which I am asking your Lordships to read a first time to-night will have for its short title "The Reference to the People Act." I want to show how, comparatively speaking, simple and easy the machinery can be made for carrying this measure into effect. I am satisfied that a great deal of the difficulty which is honestly felt in many quarters with regard to it arises from the fact that it is not thoroughly understood how comparatively speaking simple it would be in operation. I was told the other day that a gentleman, who was probably
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0153"/>
<col>255</col>
more interested in agriculture than in politics, went to a meeting to hear about the Referendum, under the belief that it was a new kind of turnip that would take the prizes at local shows in the near future. There have been many exaggerated statements made as to the difficulties surrounding this measure&#x2014;its complexity, the disturbance that would be introduced into public life, and, what is also an important matter, the cost, which has been put in some quarters at a very large figure.<lb/>
I am quite aware that it is viewed with distrust in opposite quarters and from opposite points of view, and that some think it will be a very violent innovation in our public life, while others oppose it because they seem to fear that it will put obstacles and difficulties in the way of some of their pet schemes of reform. It is not altogether without precedent. This system is in operation in Switzerland and in some of the American States and in some of our Dominions across the sea. I do not press these analogies too far. I am quite aware that there are differences not only in the Constitutional form of the Governments of those countries as compared with our own, but in their customs and circumstances; but I am entitled to make this point, that wherever it has been tried it has been successful and that no one in any country in which it is now part of the Constitution proposes to abandon it. I agree, however, that the real question for us is to see whether it will be good for us and will suit the circumstances as they now exist in this country.<lb/>
Let me turn aside for a moment to consider what is the theory of the Constitution under which we live. I think I am right in saying that that theory is that the will of the people shall prevail. If all cannot meet and discuss matters of public interest they are to do it through their chosen representatives. Many of your Lordships will remember the passage in Tacitus, who, when describing some of the characteristics of the Teutonic races, said in his short and simple way&#x2014;
<quote>"On smaller things the chief men deliberate; on greater matters <i>all</i> the people."</quote>
That contains the very essence of the whole of our Constitutional theory. Our Constitution was never intended to deprive the people as a whole of real power in managing their own affairs, and all through our Constitutional history you find there has been a system of checks and balances
<col>256</col>
solely with the idea of securing that the people shall not be taken by surprise and have the real power taken away from them. We have three elements in our Constitution&#x2014;the Crown, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons. At varying periods of our Constitution one or other of these has made aggression on the others, but in almost every case you find that two of the three have united together to keep the third in order. I need not elaborate that, because I do not think it is a statement that will be disputed.<lb/>
The whole value in these days of our representative system is bound up with the fact that it ought to be a real and true reflex of the people whose business it is supposed to transact. I ask the question, Is it at this moment successful; is it improving? My Lords, I venture to say that he will be a bold man who will say that during the last quarter of a century our representative system has been growing in success. I venture to say it has not. Any one who studies the events of the last twenty years will see that from one cause or another the people have been losing power as compared with the Governments of the day and the Party managers who are responsible for choosing candidates for membership of the other House of Parliament. One result of the proposals I am about to explain will be that they would have the effect of restoring the reality of power to the people. In legislation the theory is that those who are elected as representatives are a sort of jury to hear expert discussion and then to decide. They are to be representatives in the true sense of the term and not delegates bound hand and foot to do, or not to do, certain things. Do the circumstances as they now exist correspond in any real degree with that theory?<lb/>
I have no desire to be thought to be making an attack on the other branch of the Legislature. It was never my good fortune to be even eligible for membership of it. I was in the unfortunate position for seven years after I came of age of not being a member of this House and of not being eligible for the other House of Parliament, and perhaps if I had been I should not have been elected, but I have nothing but real admiration for the other House of Parliament at its best. But the point I want to press is, Does the House of Commons as it is now elected
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0154"/>
<col>257</col>
really reflect beyond all doubt and possibility of doubt on all matters the current opinion of the day as it is found amongst the voters? We all give lip service to the doctrine that we want to make the people supreme, that we want to defer to their will. We all agree&#x2014;this House has never disputed it&#x2014;that the considered, the real, will of the people in all matters of legislation shall become law; but what is not certain, although sometimes the distinction is not sufficiently, in my opinion, borne in mind, is that what may happen to be the opinion of the majority of the House of Commons is not certain to be the real will of the constituencies.<lb/>
If there is one doctrine which I dislike more than another it is the doctrine of "the mandate," and in this I know I shall have the support of the noble Viscount opposite, the President of the Council, because I have heard him speak eloquently on the same subject. Every one is apt to interpret the result of a General Election in the way that pleases him best. I am not saying it more of one Party in politics than the other, but we are both apt to think that when the side with which we agree is in a majority there is a mandate given, as it is called, upon practically everything which that Party is going to put before Parliament. In my humble opinion no General Election can be fought in that sense on a single issue. No General Election ever is so fought, and if you cast your mind back on the last three or four that have been held I think you will find that that is so. I will take, for the purpose of illustration, the election held in December of last year. It is part of the case of noble Lords opposite and of those who agree with them that that election was fought on the single issue of the Constitutional question and the Bill which was put before the country by the Government before the election. I am anxious to know how long that theory of the last General Election is going to last. The idea in some quarters is that if the Parliament Bill should become law, the Government, without any further appeal to the country, intends to pass a great variety of measures of very far-reaching consequences. But either the last election was fought on the Parliament Bill as the dominating issue or it was not. If it was it gives no mandate, so to speak, to the Government to pass all these other matters, whether it be Home Rule, Disestablishment, or any of the other things,
<col>258</col>
without a further appeal to the constituencies, whom, we all admit, are our common masters. The Government cannot have it both ways.<lb/>
Let me put the matter a point further as to the representative character of the other House of Parliament. It is, and has been, elected for the last twenty-five years, speaking roughly, upon a system of single-member constituencies. Most of us recollect the arguments which were used at that time. Some of us, I think, myself included, were very sorry to see the breaking-up of the old historical divisions of the country. We thought, and I venture to say that experience has confirmed us, that a man would feel himself to be a bigger power, that he would have more sense of responsibility, if he were one of five or seven members for a large city or of six or eight members for a county or a division of a county, than if he had only the small and, comparatively speaking, sometimes petty interest of a particular division of a city or of a county to think of. But if I were to pursue that line of argument I should be trespassing in the domain of proportional representation.<lb/>
It was urged twenty-five years ago as one of the main arguments for single-member constituencies that the inequalities which would appear in some places would be corrected by inequalities in another, and that, upon the whole, a proper representation of the country would be attained. At the best it was only a rough-and-ready method, but I venture to say that experience has falsified those prophecies and that the hopes of a successful result have not been fulfilled. But whether it is owing to single-member constituencies or to other causes, there can be no doubt whatever that, during these twenty-five years, the power of Party organisations has enormously increased. Personally, I think it is largely due to the fact that, in almost every constituency, there is only one member returned and that that member, as a candidate, is chosen by the Party organisations on each side. The Party organisation usually falls into the hands of the more extreme men, so that the result which is put before the great mass of the electors is a choice between a good Party man on each side&#x2014;a Party man who, so to speak, toes the line to the satisfaction of the organisation; and the moderate, sensible, ordinary citizen is often confronted with what he regards as little else than a choice of evils at the poll because he does not altogether
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0155"/>
<col>259</col>
agree with all the opinions of either of those between whom he has to choose.<lb/>
The defects of our system do not stop even there. Our system has tended to place an altogether exaggerated measure of power in the hands of small minorities. When parties are more or less equally divided in a constituency the compact organisation of 100, 150, or 200 voters is a very important thing to one or other of the candidates. They are enthusiastic people, and they are organised in such a way that they can convey the impression to one side or the other that they and their votes can turn the election, and there is a great temptation in the heat of an election for a candidate to give pledges so as to secure those votes. And when he is returned he is apt, for the sake of pleasing these voters, to advance in some way or other the particular measure in which they are interested. Now if any considerable number of the members of the same Party find themselves in the same position, they band themselves together, and pressure is put by them on the Party Whips to give facilities to this particular item of legislation or even to place it in the Party programme. And when it gets there it becomes almost imposed on the Party as a whole, who do not like to revolt against their Party and feel that they have not an opportunity to give effect to their real opinions. So that it happens that perhaps a minority get a fictitious importance attached to the particular subject in which they are interested, because those who do not agree with it are deprived of the opportunity of opposing it, feeling that if they did so they would be charged with desertion of the Party and disloyalty to those with whom they honourably desire to act. There is also the pressure of the central funds, and the pressure which the organisation can put on an individual member, so to speak, to stand with the Party all along the line.<lb/>
If I want to put the real argument for the proposal I am making I have to go to the admissions and even the arguments of those who are opposed to it. It is said by those who are anxious for some particular reform that there are many obstacles in their path&#x2014;that the way of those who want reform is hard. United, they dislike a Second Chamber altogether, because a Second Chamber tends to be Conservative and as such is an obstacle, as they think, an undue obstacle in their path. Too often it becomes obvious that the idea of these
<col>260</col>
reformers is that the country is not so much to get what it likes, but is to take what these reformers think is good for it. There was a picturesque illustration given of this by one of the colleagues of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He drew a picture of a band of gentlemen roped together climbing a mountain side. They were roped together in case they fell over the precipice, the inference being that unless they were roped together they would not reach the top. My contention is that they ought not to reach the top unless there is a majority separately for each one of the things which they are advocating. The point is put with singular candour by a recent writer on the question of this reference to the people. I hold in my hand a small book which is by a Miss Stoddart. The writer is a strong opponent of the proposal which I am suggesting to your Lordships, but the arguments on both sides are put by her with singular fairness. Here is a short sentence [p. 104] which is supposed by the writer to be conclusive against the proposal&#x2014;
<quote>"When the people vote at an election they vote-for a number of reforms, both social and political; the man who cares for one may be quite indifferent to another. The keen educationist may have given no thought to licensing reform; the zealous advocate of old-age pensions may detest Home Rule. The orthodox Liberal is ready, no doubt, at all times to subscribe to the many items of a Newcastle programme, but elections are won by the mass of waverers, who decide on broad general principles for or against a Government, and whose main desire is for efficiency at home and abroad."</quote>
That is a large part of my case, that elections are won in this sort of way, and yet they are used for purposes which put separately to the people would not command a majority. That seems to me not an argument against the proposition I make, but an argument almost conclusive in its favour, because it restores to the people the power of voting an expression of opinion on the single issue and making sure that their will will be obeyed.<lb/>
Then this proposal would separate to some extent the matters of administration and legislation. At present under our system they are bound to be put together. If the House of Commons rejects an important measure proposed by the Government the Government as a rule resigns, and therefore it may be said the House of Commons and the people whom they represent might prefer to accept a measure which they do not like rather than lose
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0156"/>
<col>261</col>
a Government which they do like. I know it is said that no Government in this country would survive any one of its important measures being lost by a reference to the people. I do not see myself that it follows. I can easily understand some one, greatly impressed by the administration of the Home Office at the present day, by the sympathy extended to the Dartmoor shepherd, or perhaps the personal gallantry exhibited in the East-end of London, who would wish to keep the Government but do not want all their legislation. Now, this proposal would at any rate afford to the people the opportunity which they ought to have of distinguishing between those two things. At any rate, if fairly put to the country it would stop the sort of thing which Miss Stoddart describes, and which is sometimes described in even more picturesque language as "log-rolling," between the advocates of one reform and another.<lb/>
It is a point in favour of this proposal that nowhere, wherever it has been adopted, do the people desire to get rid of it. A Swiss writer, M. Curti, says&#x2014;
<quote>"The most absolute peace prevails over the whole country on voting day. The Referendum is therefore a very tranquil instrument for the arrangement of public affairs. A majestic calm is associated with it. &#x2026; The minority cannot revolt against the decisions thus confirmed, <i>Roma locuta est</i>. The measures accepted by the Referendum, i.e., sanctioned by the majority of the people, have a greater vitality in the people's consciousness than the simple decrees of a representative council. The progress accomplished through the Referendum is an intellectual gain which can never ho withdrawn."</quote>
The editor of one of the chief Swiss papers writes&#x2014;
<quote>"From my personal experience I can tell you that nobody in Switzerland would dream of giving up the Referendum. The man insane enough to make the proposal would be stoned. The Referendum is undeniably conservative in its working. It acts as a brake on the legislative machine, and prevents its going too quickly ahead or doing too many things at a time."</quote>
And Mr. Hobson, a distinguished member of the Party opposite, says&#x2014;
<quote>"Critics of the Referendum fail to take account of one of the most valuable effects of thatrueasure&#x2014;its reaction upon the nature of the Bills that are constructed. The temper and discretion of the House of Commons would dispose it to frame measures which the consultative Chamber would accept, and to adopt the amendments of a body that had no power to compel adoption."</quote>
And he goes on to point out that it would work in this way, that if there was a re
<col>262</col>
ference to the people in the case of the two Chambers disagreeing it would be important that a Bill should not be framed of such a violent nature as to lead to hostility or to a chance of its rejection at the time of the reference.<lb/>
I desire before I sit down to explain in a few words the method by which I should like to see this proposal put in force. The Bill proposes that there shall be a reference to the people under two different sets of circumstances, hi the first place, in the case of a difference between the two Houses of Parliament. The words of the clause which deal with that are as follow&#x2014;
<quote>"When any Bill for a public general Act of Parliament (in this Act referred to as a 'rejected Bill') is passed by the House of Commons and is sent up to the House of Lords before the 1st day of July in the Session in which it is so passed, but the House of Lords rejects such Bill or fails to pass such Bill within 40 days after it is so sent up to that House, or passes such Bill with any amendment to which the House of Commons will not, agree, such Bill shall be, on the demand of either House of Parliament, submitted to a poll of the Parliamentary electors of the United Kingdom."</quote>
I have thought whether it would be possible to frame a schedule of Bills, either Constitutional or other, which should of necessity in the case of difference of opinion between the two Houses be referred to the people. In some respects such a proposal would have advantages, but it would also have this crowning disadvantage, that it would necessitate the creation of some tribunal to decide whether or not any particular Bill came within the category. In our unwritten Constitution and in the circumstances in which we are placed the formation of such a tribunal will be one, I will not say of insuperable, but of very great difficulty. Clearly we cannot put the duty in the hands of the Government of the day. Equally obviously we cannot refer it to an outside authority of a purely legal nature. That would not be suitable, having regard to the position of Parliament in our Constitution. The suggestion has been made that there should be a certain number&#x2014;a small number&#x2014;of members of both Houses of Parliament, with a neutral chairman, appointed at the beginning of each session, and that this tribunal should decide whether or not the reference to the people should take place. But the difficulty of finding an impartial chairman of sufficient position and standing is very great. I do not go further into that matter at this moment.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0157"/>
<col>263</col>
I know it will be objected that this proposal will tend to too many references. But surely the discretion of either one House or another of Parliament may be trusted not to ask for a reference upon all sorts of frivolous and unimportant questions. There would still remain that part of our Constitution which implies the right and duty of conferences between the two Houses. Personally I think it is a great calamity that that has been abandoned so much as it has. I believe that if in the past there had been more of these conferences a good many Bills would have been saved which have been lost.<lb/>
With regard to the provision allowing a majority of either House to ask for the machinery to be put in motion, obviously that does not afford a means of escape from the difficulties under which we are suffering. Noble Lords opposite, not without some reasonable ground, complain of what is described as the partisan majority of this House, and I frankly admit that if there is only to be a reference to the people when the Houses disagree, they would not have a fair and reasonable chance of getting the reference they might desire when a Conservative Government was in power and had more or less command of the majority in this House. I propose to get out of that difficulty by saying that a certain number of members of the House of Commons&#x2014;I fix it at 200, but it does not matter to me whether it is 150 or 250&#x2014;may also demand that the reference to the people may be put in motion. The essential point is that there ought to be a provision made to make sure that a Party minority of the House of Commons should have equal power to have a reference to the people should they see fit so to desire.<lb/>
Again, the criticism may be made that the Liberal Party might be wanting to have a great many references when the Conservative Party was in power. I believe that difficulty would be best solved as we go along. The people of this country are not so foolish as not to see who is making a factious difficulty in working a matter of this kind. And even if there were at first one or two more references than were necessary, I believe it would be a valuable experience, and a great education, and I do not think it would tell badly on the working of our institutions as a whole. I have not com
<col>264</col>
mitted myself in any way in regard to the thorny question of a Reference in relation to fiscal matters. If there were to be a great reversal of the fiscal policy of this country, I should say myself it would be fair that the people should have an opportunity of pronouncing upon it on its merits. I see very great difficulty in the point made by noble Lords opposite that the finance of the year cannot be made the subject of such a reference with all its attendant delays. I think that the power of 200 members of the other House of Parliament, the House which is mainly concerned with finance, will be a sufficient guarantee that nothing arbitrary will be done behind the backs of the people.<lb/>
So far as the machinery of the Bill goes I propose to apply all the provisions as to Parliamentary elections, such as writs notices, corrupt practices, and other subjects. One point, however, needs to he mentioned. I propose to say that the votes on the affirmative side shall be 2 per cent. more than on the negative&#x2014;in other words, I do not propose that if you have millions of electors voting, that the odd man, so to speak, should carry the day. But 2 per cent. is an arbitrary figure, and it is not worth discussing at the moment whether the figure should be 1, 3, or 5 per cent. There are seven millions of voters on the roll at the present time. Five millions voted at each of the elections of last year; a great deal of the balance is made up by the fact that there were a great many uncontested seats whose voters would not be counted; but supposing that four millions were to vote under the reference in this Bill, a 2 per cent. majority would mean that there would be a majority of 40,000 in favour of the proposed measure. That does not seem to me to be an extravagant proposition. I suggest also that all the pollings should take place on one day. Other clauses provide for the abolition of what is known as plural voting in the poll of Parliamentary electors. In other words, no person shall vote in more than one constituency at one and the same poll. This provides not only for one man one vote, but also for what is known as one vote, one value. The poll of University electors shall also take place on one day. There would be none of those anomalies of a very large constituency returning a member whose voice and vote in the other House are overbalanced by three or four very small constituencies.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0158"/>
<col>265</col>
I will now glance at some of the objections winch have been taken to the proposal. It is said to be an appeal from knowledge to ignorance. I do not think we have any occasion to be too proud of whether or not our appeals at a General Election are or are not from knowledge to ignorance. I dare say that both Parties are guilty, but those among the colleagues of the speaker at Limehouse can hardly say that the appeal under this proposal would be more of an appeal from knowledge to ignorance than it is under the existing system. I am told also that the cost will be extravagant. According to the best information I can get the cost in Switzerland ranges from a Id. to 2.&#x00BD;d. a vote, while the average cost for the reference in Switzerland where there are 600,000 electors is about&#x00A3;10,000. But if the cost were 2d. a vote it would be only something like&#x00A3;40,000 or&#x00A3;50,000 for each reference. The advantages which could be gained from the proposal would be, in my opinion, cheaply bought at such an expenditure.<lb/>
Another objection urged against this proposal is one which, if I thought it were true, would lead me to abandon it and say no more about it. It is alleged that this proposal would tend to destroy the House of Commons and its sense of responsibility, that it would even impinge on the majesty of Parliament and reduce both Houses of Parliament to the status of mere debating societies. If the House of Commons is now a debating society it is very often not allowed to debate. I believe that this proposal would have precisely the opposite effect. I believe that, so far from preventing, it would put a premium on much fuller discussion in both Houses of Parliament on important matters than you have now. I believe that it would operate against the closure and the guillotine, because I think it would lead to the efforts of those who sincerely believe in any of their proposals to convince instead of to coerce their opponents. So far from destroying our institutions, the proposal would tend to restore fidelity to our discussions and to Parliament. I believe also that it would increase the powers of the ordinary citizen and the amount of interest he will take in public affairs; and beyond all question it would give him a control over his own and his country's destiny which at the moment he does not possess. It would clear the way for wise and moderate Constitutional reform, because the changes that would be
<col>266</col>
made would have to rest on the solid foundation of the people's will, and only those changes would be made which would command the general sense of the nation as a whole. I beg to present the Bill and to ask that it should be read a first time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00791">Moved, That the Bill be now read l<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;(<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00792"><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the first place. I have to thank my noble friend for his kindness in informing me beforehand of the contents of the Bill which he has presented to-day. In ordinary circumstances 1 should have merely said the fewest possible words on this occasion. but the circumstances are somewhat peculiar. My noble friend has told us that he has brought this Bill forward entirely on his own responsibility, and he has taken a course which is not very usual in this House&#x2014;though I need not say that I take no exception to it&#x2014;of discussing, not merely the Bill, but the whole subject at length on the First Reading. My noble friend said nothing about the Second Reading of his Bill, and I am inclined to suppose that he would regard it as being something of a. matter for the House as a whole to decide if and when the Bill should proceed to its further stages. In view of that uncertainty and in these circumstances I think it right, the subject being so important, to trouble your Lordships at greater length than I should in the ordinary circumstances of a First Reading, and I can only promise that if the Bill goes on to its later stages I will not trouble your Lordships by repeating anything that I may say to-day.<lb/>
My noble friend said that this was an important measure. It is, indeed, in my opinion a measure of the very greatest and most far-reaching importance. It seems to me and I think to a number of other people that it involves a more abrupt departure, a wider deflection, from the Constitutional path on which we have marched in this country for the last 600 years, than almost any other measure which could be proposed. It is a far wider departure from the established practice of this country than is the Parliament Bill&#x2014;I almost apologise for making that comparison. I say far more than that. I say it is a far more abrupt departure from the Constitutional practice
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0159"/>
<col>267</col>
of this country than would he a Bill, which no one proposes, for the establishment of a Single Chamber. How can I support what noble Lords opposite consider that rather bold statement? All through, this measure is an attack upon the representative system under which we have lived so long, and, indeed, the noble Lord devoted a considerable part of his speech&#x2014;the whole of the earlier part&#x2014;to a long, searching, and acute analysis of the defects of our representative system. I am far from saying that the results of that system are or ever have been absolutely perfect, but it is not sufficient to show that the present system is not a perfect one in order to induce either House of Parliament, or the country, to accept this tremendous change. There is nobody in this House whom I conceive to be more different both in character and opinions from Jean Jacques Rousseau than is my noble friend Lord Balfour; and I certainly never supposed the day would come when I should see him standing at the Table eloquently addressing to your Lordships the views enunciated in the <i>Control Social</i>.<lb/>
The noble Lord has said that he does not wish to press too strongly precedent. But at the same time he has used precedent to support his arguments to no little extent. He naturally devoted some attention to the most marked and familiar precedent of Switzerland. I have no doubt that in the main the system suits Switzerland, but I think my noble friend was beyond the mark when he said the Referendum had no opponents there. I have information showing that there are many critics in Switzerland who object to it for some of the reasons which the noble Lord enumerated and which are familiar to your Lordships. I may remind the House that when the Referendum in Switzerland first began to be applied to national affairs it was strongly opposed by many Swiss Statesmen on the ground that the representative system might be and was equally democratic and not open to the disadvantage of the popular poll. But can we draw any useful analogy from Switzerland so far as this country is concerned? The noble Lord went back to the description by the Roman historian of the habits of the early Germans, and it is quite true that from that day to this all down the centuries the habit of government of the descendants of those Germans
<col>268</col>
of whom Tacitus wrote has been in effect government by show of hands. In every village community it has been the custom in Switzerland, and the custom still survives in some cantons, in small places in those cantons, of direct government by public meeting and by show of hands.<lb/>
From the Fifteenth Century onwards the larger districts have been subject to these polls, and, as I have said, in the last century after years of gradual formation of the Swiss Confederation the principle was finally applied to national affairs. Even now polls are held in Switzerland in the smaller areas of government. In Berne between the years 1897 and 1903 thirty of these polls were taken on matters of varying importance, and the effect both on municipal and Parliamentary life in Switzerland has been what you would expect&#x2014;that you have a form undoubtedly of popular government, democratic government in which those men who are here expected to exercise, whether on a small or a large scale, whether in parish council, county council, or in Parliament, the varying virtues of statesmanship, are there far more analogous to our Civil servants and our permanent officials who act in the different areas of our municipal life. Here everything is different. Here we have gone on from time to time giving more self-government to localities, county councils, parish councils, and so on, and even in quite recent years we have adhered to the representative system because that is the system which has become ingrained in our public life. We have been proud of the progress of Parliament to greater liberty during the 600 years of the formal existence of the House of Commons. I repeat that we work on entirely different lines, and to attempt now to step on to the path which a country like Switzerland has followed for as many years is as immense a Constitutional change as your Lordships could possibly be asked to accept.<lb/>
The noble Lord has said that there are other instances of a poll of the electors in Australia. It is true that in Australia, where there is a written Constitution, arrangements are made by which amendments of the Constitution have in certain circumstances been subjected to a popular poll. That may or may not be the necessary concomitant of a written Constitution, but it is not in itself an argument for the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0160"/>
<col>269</col>
general application of the Referendum as proposed in this Bill. Australia, however, offers one instance&#x2014;the only instance in the world of the possible application of the Referendum to a deadlock between the two Houses&#x2014;and that is in Queensland, where an Act was passed in 1907 authorising a referendum in certain circumstances in the case of a deadlock between the two Houses, but it has never yet so far been applied, and therefore the noble Lord cannot get much comfort from that with regard to the practical effect of the system in dealing with a deadlock between the two Houses. Other polls have been taken in Australia. Two were taken in different States on the subject of religious instruction in schools. The issue was presented in a very simple form, and I quite admit&#x2014;and I make a present of the fact to the noble Lord&#x2014;that, although the results in the two States were different, the operation of the Referendum in those instances was not unsatisfactory.<lb/>
Then you come to the United States. The Government of the United States itself knows nothing of the Referendum, but in many of the States, for the purpose of altering the State Constitution, the. Referendum is used. But there is a curious fact attaching to its use. When it is used for the purpose of Constitutional amendment it is used at the same time for the election of a Governor and the other State officials, and the curious result follows that comparatively so little interest is often taken in the amendment of the Constitution that although the voting takes place at the same time as the election of Governor, the poll on the Constitutional question is often remarkably smaller than that in the election of the State officials. That, I think, is not very encouraging to those who suppose that it will be possible to bring people to the poll with all the ceremony of a General Election for the purpose of the Referendum.<lb/>
But there are other instances in the United States. The State of Oregon is now governed almost entirely by the Referendum and by its sequel&#x2014;it is, perhaps, the inevitable sequel in the long run&#x2014;what is known as the Initiative. In Oregon 80 per cent. of the voters can introduce and pass legislation on any subject, or an amendment of the Constitution, over the heads of their Legislature. When a Referendum is taken in Oregon on a Bill a copy of the Bill is deirculate to every elector, and attached
<col>270</col>
to the Bill are the rival arguments of the two parties for and against the measure, these, however, being supplied at the expense&#x2014;the expense of the printing and paper&#x2014;by the members of the respective parties. Is any analogy to be drawn for this country from the proceedings of the State of Oregon? It cannot be disputed that the institution of such a system can only be based on a profound distrust of the Legislature by the community in which it exists, and although the noble Lord in moderate terms criticised the composition, constitution, and actions of the other House, he certainly would not, I am sure, use such a phrase as profound distrust of the Legislature in speaking of the House of. Commons.<lb/>
I said just now that the Initiative was likely to be, the inevitable sequel of the establishment of the Referendum. In Switzerland the Initiative&#x2014;that is to say the demand for the introduction of a particular measure, with, of course, the possibility of passing it after it has been discussed by the popular vote&#x2014;is applicable, I think, only to alterations in the Constitution; but there is a strong body of opinion in Switzerland, increasing, I am told, which is anxious to apply this principle of the Initiative to legislation of all kinds. And when you come to think of it it is not unnatural. My noble friend provides for two cases. He provides for the case when one House wants something done and the other does not want it done. The people may want it done, and he asks the people to decide. The other case is where both Houses want something done and the people may not want it, and he again asks the country to decide. But there is another case, for which he does not provide but for which in the long run if he starts on this course he will he asked to provide, in which neither House wants a thing done but the people may want it done, or a considerable number of electors think they do, and they are determined that Parliament shall undertake the consideration of it; and when you have reached that point you start on a downward career, and your representative system will have gone by the board altogether.<lb/>
Speaking still on the conditions of the Referendum, I think it can hardly be disputed that there are two conditions which, if it is to be exercised at all, must
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0161"/>
<col>271</col>
be fulfilled. One is that the issue should be a simple and direct one, so far as a political issue can be simple and direct, and the other, to which I would call the noble Lord's particular attention because he did not touch on this difficulty, is that the subject to be voted on should be one which in some considerable degree affects those who vote upon it. How many measures are there of the ordinary kind which come before Parliament which could be submitted to the country in the form of a simple issue? Take for example our Bills of 1906&#x2014;the Education Bill and the Licensing Bill; in what form does the noble Lord think that those Bills would have been presented to the country? His Bill, I understand, provides that they would have been presented in the form in which they came up from the House of Commons. Your Lordships remember the Education Bill of 1906, and some of you may remember generally the form in which it came from the other House. Here we were prepared to accept a considerable number of Amendments, and after we had made concessions the form in which you would have supposed the matter would have been submitted to the country would be the remaining points of difference, but those remaining points of difference, as your Lordships will remember, were of an exceedingly complicated kind turning apparently on matters of small detail. But if the Bill were presented to the country in the form in which it came up from the House of Commons, your Lordships would have lost all the benefit of the concessions which we were prepared to make, and in the circumstances it is not quite clear to me why we should have offered to make those concessions. The Bill presumably would either have been thrown out or would have been amended by your Lordships, and then it would have gone to the country in the form in which it left the House of Commons. That does not seem to me from the point of noble Lords opposite an instance in which your wishes would have been carried out by the Referendum.<lb/>
Then I come to the second difficulty, which to my mind in some respects goes deeper in a country like this. What would be the effect of submitting to the electors of the whole of the United Kingdom such a measure, for instance, as the Scottish Land Bill? When a measure of that kind is discussed in the other House the Members who sit for Scottish constituencies
<col>272</col>
and when it is discussed in this House noble Lords who come from Scotland give opinions which are listened to with respect and which in the one House or the other according to its complexion influence the decision that is arrived at. But take such a Bill as that&#x2014;a Bill which your Lordships thought changed in a disastrous manner-the land system of one part of the United Kingdom. How are you going to interest the individual voter in Connemara or-Cornwall or the East-End of London on the details of a Scottish Land Bill? I will take another instance. Suppose a Bill were brought in&#x2014;an unfair Bill l should call it&#x2014;and passed through the House of Commons to divide up demesne land and untenanted land of noble Lords and of landlords generally among tenant-purchasers. I am bound to say I do not think that if a Bill of that kind were sent to the Referendum the interests of those who own land would get fair play.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00793"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: In a case of that kind under the Parliament Bill a measure passed by the House of Commons would become law over the heads of your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00794"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: What the noble Lord says is perfectly true; but we are not discussing the Parliament Bill at the present moment. I am trying to show that the hopes which the noble Lord himself as a moderate man holds and the hopes which he desires your Lordships to entertain of the effect of the Referendum being always moderating in character are unfounded. I think there are certain questions, in a complex society like ours containing so many different classes and with such abrupt distinctions of rich and poor, on which the interests of owners of property and others would stand an infinitely worse chance of being fairly weighed than they would be by a deliberative Assembly&#x2014;even by the House of Commons without a Second Chamber.<lb/>
That brings me to two remarkable deductions from the Bill of the noble Lord. If all I have stated is well-founded, if it is impossible to take a popular poll all over the United Kingdom fairly on matters affecting only one part of the United Kingdom, it really looks as if the noble Lord were in disguise an apostle of the system of Home Rule all round. I do not think there is anything which brings home to thoughtful people the meaning of and the reason for what is
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0162"/>
<col>273</col>
known as Home Rule all round than this proposition of applying the popular vote. The second deduction is the remarkable fact that the noble Lord abandons the system of plural voting. I do not know precisely why, and I am not sure that all the members of the Party opposite will thank him or the leaders of the Conservative Party for having so lightly thrown away the principle of plural voting in order to introduce this system of the Referendum.<lb/>
There are two other points to which I should like to allude. One is the question of finance, over which the noble Lord skated rather lightly. As I understand, he treats all finance, even the Finance Bill of the year, as an ordinary Bill, and any financial measure or the financial clauses of any measure will be liable at the desire of your Lordships to be subjected to the Referendum. That seems to me an advance, in the way of encroachment, upon anything which your Lordships have so far suggested. It is true that your Lordships threw out the Budget on one occasion, but you implied that you did not wish that practice to become a habit. But if every financial measure is liable to he subjected to this popular vote, it seems to me a very short step, indeed scarcely a step at all, for your Lordships to claim the power of amending the Finance Bill or the financial clauses of any Bill; for surely the greater ought to include the less, and if your Lordships are to drive a measure to the country it seems to me logical that you should have the power to amend the Bill so as to express the form in which you wish it ultimately to become law.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the 2 per cent. majority. Under the Bill the majority must be 2 per cent. greater than the minority, or the measure to which the Referendum is applied will not become law. Is the noble Lord prepared that a Bill of very far-reaching importance should become law by the popular vote of a very small proportion of the electors? That might easily happen. Take a case of this kind. Say that out of every million voters 200,000 voted against a Bill and 205,000 for. That would be a vote of 40&#x00BD;per cent., which is quite as much as you are likely to get in a great many cases. That would mean that a measure would be carried by the active support of only 20&#x00BD;per cent. of the electors. I should have thought that
<col>274</col>
noble Lords would have hesitated somewhat to have put important measures to that sort of hazard. because it is generally agreed that in taking the Referendum you act on the principle that you must be content with the votes of those who are willing to go to the poll, and that those who stay away must be taken as assenting to whatever decision is arrived at.<lb/>
I ask another question. Why is it that a rejected Bill should be sent to the country at the instance of the rejecting House? When I saw that provision in the Bill I assumed that it could be only for the purpose of "rubbing in," so to speak. the unpopularity of the Government, and of giving, them a blow. Now the noble Lord says he sees no reason why the rejection of a Bill after a Referendum should damage the Government or be treated in any case as a reason for the resignation of the Government. If that be so, I confess I do not understand what the object can be of the provision which allows the rejecting House, after a Bill is lost, to demand a poll of the electorate concerning it.<lb/>
Then, on the question of cost, the noble Lord has cited the Swiss figures, but if you are going to have an election on English lines&#x2014;and the noble Lord has very wisely found it necessary to adopt all the surrounding proceedings of the Corrupt Practices Act&#x2014;you will have to pay for it in English figures; and I think you will find that, quite apart from the official expenses, a Referendum on a subject of any importance must involve a great deal of the personal and private expense which is involved in a General Election. Noble Lords opposite have always asked that Home Rule should go to the Referendum. Is Home Rule going to the Referendum in the pastoral silence which the noble Lord tells us reigns all over Switzerland when a Referendum is taken? Are you going to take a Referendum in a spirit of complete silence on Home Rule in Belfast or Portadown? If the measure is at all a large one you will have to go through the greater part of the paraphernalia and the expense of a General Election; if it is of so little importance that you do not think it worth while to go to that trouble and expense then nobody will come to vote.<lb/>
Where you have a written Constitution such as the Constitutions that some of our self-governing Dominions possess, I can conceive that the Referendum may not uselessly be included in it, and that it
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0163"/>
<col>275</col>
should be applied to Constitutional change and amendment. The noble Lord, with great fairness and power, pointed out the extreme difficulty of limiting the Referendum in this country to Constitutional changes. He showed that it would be absurd to leave the initiative to the Government of the day and equally objectionable to place it in the hands of an outside tribunal. He has therefore abandoned the attempt at definition, and in doing so has, I fear, fallen over the precipice by including all subjects of every kind, financial as well as others.<lb/>
My Lords, I cannot help thinking that the introduction of this Referendum plan must be regarded rather as an expedient, as a counter-stroke to the policy of the Government, than as a settled act of policy of the Party opposite. There were two remarkable letters by a great Constitutional authority, Sir William Anson, in <i>The Times</i> in the month of January. In the first of them Sir William Anson seemed to me to state that he had been driven into acceptance of this Referendum plan by the action of His Majesty's Government. In the second he dealt with the objections to the Referendum, and it is difficult to read that letter without seeing that those objections weighed very heavily in his mind.<lb/>
The plan has been accepted, as I believe, without much examination by noble Lords opposite and their friends in an easy, lighthearted belief that the action of the Referendum in this country, if adopted, would be of a purely conservative kind. As to that nobody can say. I have attempted to give reasons why in my judgment and in some cases, such as where taxation is concerned, its operation might be of a kind most unpalatable, not merely to noble Lords opposite, but to all persons who entertain at all moderate views. I confess that it is an astonishing thing to me that noble Lords opposite and their friends should have thus, without consideration, engaged in a game in which so much is put to hazard, and should thus have struck at the very roots of our Constitutional life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00795"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD TENNYSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me say that in Australia the Referendum has proved on the whole a success. In the Convention called together to frame the Constitution in 1890 the Referendum was first mooted and then rejected. Seven years later, after a trial of the Referendum in South Australia, it was adopted unanimously. Under the Referendum the
<col>276</col>
Commonwealth Constitution was voted on by the people of Australia and adopted. The franchise for the Senate was put to the Referendum in 1906; and last year, on April 13, Referenda were held on the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States, and on the transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth. Thus in ten years we have had three Commonwealth Referenda. There have also been States Referenda. There was one in New South Wales in 1903 on the reduction of the members of the House of Assembly. There have been Referenda, too, as to whether there should be religious instruction in schools, and perhaps your Lordships would wish that I should give you a. sample of the ballot paper. I hold a copy of one in my hand from Queensland on this subject. The question submitted was&#x2014;
<quote>"Are you in favour of introducing the following system into State schools&#x2014;namely:&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>''The State schoolmaster, in school hours, teaches selected Bible lessons from a reading book provided for the purpose, but is not allowed to give sectarian teaching.</quote>
<quote>"Any minister of religion is entitled, in school hours, to give the children of his own denomination an hour's religious instruction on such day or days as the school committee can arrange for.</quote>
<quote>"Any parent is entitled to withdraw his child from all religious teaching if he chooses to do so."</quote>
This Bill was carried by a large majority, about 50 per cent. of the electorate voting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00796"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Was that in Queensland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00797"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD TENNYSON</member><membercontribution>: Yes. I know that some of your Lordships think that the Referendum would diminish the authority of the representatives of the people. That is not the case. It enlarges their responsibility. It makes them responsible, not merely to the Party caucus, as they are in this country, but to the people at large. It also has another good result. It renders Ministers more open to reason, and more open to compromise. This is partly owing to the uncertainty of the Referendum, and partly owing to the fear of the cost, though the cost in Australia does not seem to be excessive. The cost of a Referendum, in that huge Continent of large distances, difficult communication, and high salaries, taken together with a General Election, is&#x00A3;6,500, and taken apart front a General Election the cost is computed to be&#x00A3;40,000. I earnestly desire, more especially if the Lords' Veto is abolished, that some sort of Referendum should be tried here, for
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0164"/>
<col>277</col>
it isolates any subject on which the decision of the people is desired, and prevents friction and bars violent Constitutional change. Therefore, my Lords, I am certainly in favour of my noble friend's Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00798"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to say a few words on behalf of the Front Opposition Bench in the, absence of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, who is unfortunately confined to his house by a slight cold. The noble Lord whose Bill we are asked to read a first time to-day has explained to your Lordships that he alone is responsible for its details. That is so. I myself have not even had the advantage which the noble Earl the Leader of the House has had of seeing the Bill. Nevertheless I thank my noble friend, on behalf of my side of the House, for having brought the subject forward; for, whether we can agree to all the details of the Bill or not, it, is greatly to the public good that this question should now be launched on the threshold of Parliamentary discussion, and that for the first time in the history of the British Parliament we should discuss the application to our Constitution of an instrument which I thoroughly believe is destined to have a permanent place in it. I can, of course, express no opinion on the details of the measure, but I do most cordially agree with Lord Balfour of Burleigh that every one of the details can be adjusted. They should be, and will be, discussed, not only in the Houses of Parliament, but on the platform and in the Press; but on the threshold of our discussion. I register my complete agreement with my noble friend that there is nothing here that cannot be adjusted in detail.<lb/>
I do not propose to copy the noble Earl the Leader of the House in that close examination which he has given to the Bill, but 1 desire to examine some of his observations. Unless I misunderstood him, the noble Earl seemed to regard this proposal for the application of the Referendum to our Constitutional difficulties as a, much more revolutionary proposal than any contained in the Parliament Bill, and, with the perfect gravity which so adorns him, he added that it would be far more revolutionary than any proposal for the establishment of single-Chamber government if anybody were ever to make such a proposal. Let us examine that. It is, in his view, a comparatively moderate
<col>278</col>
proposal to abolish altogether the effective influence on legislation of a Second Chamber. It is a comparatively moderate proposal to enable the House of Commons. of its own will and without the consent of any other legislative body, within two years to effect any change in the laws or the Constitution. It is a comparatively moderate proposal to deprive the electors of the certainty they now enjoy, that no great or sudden change can be made in the Constitution without their being consulted. All those are comparatively moderate proposals. But the moment we say, "Submit one single question of gravity to the electors unentangled with half a dozen other questions and unconnected with a General Election," we are told by the noble Earl that that is a drastic, revolutionary, and immoral proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00799"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think I said immoral.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00800"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I cannot go into the ethics of the case as to whether revolutions are moral or immoral. It must depend a good deal on the motives of those who make them, and the manner in which they are carried out. But, at any rate, the noble Earl will not contradict me when I say that the extraordinarily violent and radical character of the proposal shocks his innermost conservative sense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00801"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00802"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I am content to put that contrast before the people of this country. It will be put in far more eloquent language than I can command and from a thousand platforms&#x2014;which is really the conservative policy, which is the revolutionary policy. It seems to me that a more apt illustration of one of the parables of Scripture we have seldom had in the history of our Parliamentary struggles. The Government strain at the gnat of submitting an isolated issue instead of a complicated one to the people, and they swallow without the slightest hesitation the camel of single-Chamber government.<lb/>
The noble Earl discussed the working of this system in the United States of America and in Switzerland. I think that we shall derive great profit from a careful study of the way in which the Referendum is worked in those two countries. But I quite agree with him
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0165"/>
<col>279</col>
that perhaps its working there is not the illustration most applicable to our peculiar conditions. I was glad that my noble friend Lord Tennyson drew pointed attention to the success of this system in Australia, because the noble Earl opposite evidently felt the difficulty of that example. He could not say that what happened in Australia was wholly inapplicable to our conditions, and therefore he a little slurred over the illustration. Remember that not one single amendment can be made in the Constitution of Australia without a reference to the people. It is not a question of an occasional reference. The Constitution cannot be amended, even when both Houses are agreed, unless the majority of the electors in a majority of the States confirm it. It is quite true that that is the only permanent application of the system yet in vogue in Australia, but it has been used, and used with great success, as the noble Earl himself told us, in Victoria and Queensland to settle the difficult question of religious education.<lb/>
I can give from my own experience an interesting illustration of the working of the Referendum. When the South African National Convention had agreed upon their Constitution three of the Colonies expressed their adhesion to the plan by Parliamentary action, but in Natal there was a public demand for a Referendum, and the Parliament of Natal passed an Act putting to all the electors on one day the one question, "Are you, or are you not, in favour of Natal joining the Union of South Africa under the Constitution as published in the <i>Gazette</i>," of such and such a date. There was, I believe, a record poll, and every single constituency in Natal voted "Aye," and adhesion was affirmed by a great majority. This was the most complete affirmation possible by the people of Natal of their readiness to join the Union of South Africa under the Constitution which had just been made. I ask, Is there anything revolutionary in that? Is there anything undemocratic in that? Is there in that anything not consistent with the spirit of our Constitution that the will of the people shall in the last resort prevail? And if a measure of that kind can be worked in Natal and Australia, why cannot it work in the United Kingdom? Are the people of the United Kingdom less instructed in politics? Are they less patriotic or less intelligent? There is
<col>280</col>
not a member on the Government side who will say that there is any such distinction. I say, therefore, that although this proposal is new so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, it is not new so far as the British Empire is concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00803"><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I might explain. What I said was that it was new in its use for the removal of deadlocks between the two Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00804"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I will come to that in a moment. We do not believe that the expense would be prohibitive, and it does seem to us surprising that the same Government which is about to propose a large salary for members of the House of Commons should grudge the expenditure of money necessary to enable the electors of the country to have the final say in what may concern the vital elements of the Constitution. We do not agree that questions cannot be put in a simple and clear-cut form. We agree that they must be so put, but do not agree that they cannot be so put. Then the noble Earl uttered a Cassandra-like warning to those who sit on this side. "Beware," he said, "how owners of property may be treated under the Referendum." "Are you quite sure," he asked. "that the Referendum will always work in the way which your Party would prefer?" No, my Lords, we are not sure that it would so work. We have no idea in our mind, in proposing this, of a scheme which will work only and exclusively to our advantage. We are prepared to take the risks with the advantages. We adopt the scheme because we believe it is the fairest and the safest. It is quite true that under the Referendum a Bill which some Conservatives might think unfair to owners of property might be passed. Well, but so it might be passed under your system. Under the plan we propose it could not be approved by the people until it had been approved by the House of Commons. Therefore, instead of the Referendum being an additional danger in the case of such legislation, it is in the nature of an appeal and an additional safeguard. There is nothing that could happen under the Referendum that could not much more easily and probably happen under the system which would be set up by the Parliament Bill.<lb/>
I agree with what Lord Tennyson said on the subject of responsibility in the House of Commons. I do not believe
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0166"/>
<col>281</col>
that the Referendum would impair that sense of responsibility. Are we not&#x2014;I say this without personal reference to my noble friend opposite&#x2014;are we not apt to use cant phrases a good deal in this connection from both sides? Do we not know that to-day a member of the House of Commons is not as free a voter in the House as he was twenty-five years ago? Do we not know that the Party machine has established a grip over members on both sides which was not the case when my noble friend Lord Eversley, for instance, first entered the House of Commons? Is it possible for a man on either side of polities to remain in the House of Commons if he opposes his Party on some great vital question? We know that it is not. Therefore I maintain that, so far from impairing the sense of responsibility of Members of Parliament, the tendency of the Referendum would rather be, as Lord Tennyson said, to revive it, especially as it would deal a fatal blow at that system of log-rolling which has been imported from across the Atlantic, and which seems so likely vitally to affect the actions of the other House of Parliament.<lb/>
The noble Earl said lie suspected that the adoption of the Referendum on our part was simply a counter stroke to the policy of the Government and not a contribution of set policy, and he expressed surprise at the easy and light-hearted way in which the Conservative Party had adopted it. I can say for myself that the criticism falls wide of the mark, for in the comparative seclusion from the stormy sea of home politics in South Africa I have studied this question so far as I was able for several years past. I admit that the Resolutions passed in this House were somewhat suddenly brought forward. But why? Was it our fault? Were we masters of the course of business and of the conduct of the Government last year? Was not the whole of last year taken away from us by the curious concurrence of circumstances? The whole of last year, when we would have been discussing this question and formulating our policy, was taken away. When the King died and the Conference of the two Parties was held, was there one single man on this side who ever dreamt that he had parted then with his last opportunity of discussing these questions in the House of Lords? Was there one single man on the other side of the House off the Govern
<col>282</col>
ment Bench&#x2014;I question very much whether I might not include the Government Bench&#x2014;who dreamt at that moment of going into Conference that a Dissolution would ensue the moment the Conference broke down, if break down it did? Therefore I say that the taunt, courteously put as it was by the noble Earl, is undeserved, because the apparent haste and suddenness of our action was forced upon us by events over which the Government, and not we, had control.<lb/>
I have already said that I do not express any opinion on the details of a Bill I have not seen. How the Referendum is to be adjusted, how it is to be applied, how the question is to be put, what the authority shall be to invoke it, are all matters of great importance and fair questions for consideration and adjustment. We believe absolutely that they can be adjusted, and adjusted so as to settle the Constitutional difficulty which we admit exists. We agree that the Constitution is deficient in machinery for settling differences between the two Houses and preventing the existence of deadlocks. The Government have their plan. They call it the Parliament Bill. We call it, and we shall be here, in our place, prepared to prove that it is, single-Chamber tyranny. They tell us that under the Referendum we may be running risks. Yes, we may; but in the grave issues which lie before us we would far sooner take the risks from the hands of our fellow countrymen in whom we believe than from a temporary majority in the House of Commons which may utterly misrepresent the feelings of the nation. We take that deliberately and finally as part of our plan and as our choice&#x2014;the Referendum to the electorate rather than the House of Commons and its temporary majority. It is our permanent contribution, and from it we shall not recede.</membercontribution></p>

I think the doctrine was laid down by Sir Robert Peel that the physician is not required to prescribe until he is called in. It is not, perhaps, a doctrine of a very lofty character, but I do not complain of it. But if you do keep on dangling before the country and the two Houses of Parliament one lofty and noble alternative and then another, far better than anything which the poor Government has ever thought of&#x2014;if you do choose to propound an alternative policy or a series of alternative policies for yourselves&#x2014;pray do us the favour of making it intelligible to the ordinary human being. It is not sufficient to say that the Referendum is a splendid thing and capable of adjustment. We all understand what that means. It means that the noble Earl and his friends when they come into office will then put themselves to the task of recommending some proposals. But, in the meantime, if you are going to put forward alternatives at all and claim the credit of being able to say that something which is admittedly necessary you can propose better than we can, pray tell us what it is. I shall not say anything about the adoption of the Referendum in Australia or Switzerland or elsewhere, because that has been dealt with by my- noble friend the Leader of the House. But the noble Earl who has just sat down introduced a new illustration, and referred to the case of Natal. I think I am right in saying that the voters in Natal number about 7,000, or thereabouts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00808"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: It is quite a small figure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00809"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: And I think I am also right in saying that the <i>plebiscite</i> which was taken in Natal was taken in pursuance of an Act of Parliament passed by the Natal Legislature. Well, that could be done now in this country without this Bill. If both Houses of Parliament agreed, a Referendum could be taken in this country on any point; at all events, it is unnecessary to bring in this Bill for the purpose of enabling to be done here what was done in Natal.<lb/>
I am inclined to form a picture of what the Referendum is, because it is so little known in this country that, as Lord Balfour told us, some of the electors supposed it to be a new species of turnip. Let
<col>284</col>
us see how it works. We should have to set up all the machinery of an election, with returning officers and so forth, all over the country. If the Bill was one of importance we should have public meetings and literature on the walls and all the paraphernalia of a General Election without the candidates. There would be all the expenses incurred except those of the candidates. Who is to pay for all that? I suppose there might be conflicts between interests that arc wealthy and interests that are poor. Apart from the merits of the particular case, what an advantage the rich interest would have against the poor one.<lb/>
The noble Lord estimated the expenses of the Referendum at, I think,&#x00A3;40,000 or&#x00A3;50,000. He has never had the advantage of paying returning officers' expenses. Some of us here have. I remember on one occasion in a one-member constituency the election officer's expenses were&#x00A3;330. It was not a very large constituency; about 9,000 in all polled. If you apply that, yon will find that&#x00A3;1,000 would only take von over three constituencies, and there are 670 constituencies throughout the country. The Referendum would cost about a quarter of a million for returning officers' expenses alone at that rate, though I quite agree there are a good many constituencies in which a great deal less would be charged. Suppose it is an unimportant Bill or one that does not interest the whole of the United Kingdom; and here again I will take the illustration of the Scottish Small Landholders Bill. Who cares about that in England? Who knows about it? Or take Welsh Disestablishment. Who knows about that in England or Ireland? Does anybody imagine that the voters in England or Ireland would go to the poll about a thing of that kind? If they did, they would go uninstructed. The probability is they would not vote at all except upon important measures and grave occasions.<lb/>
Then how often would they be invited to vote? The Bill, as I understand&#x2014;I have not seen it&#x2014;says that if the House of Lords refuses to pass a Bill sent up from the House of Commons, then the House of Commons can claim the Referendum. That would have happened at least five or six times in the four years between 1906 and 1910. When a Conservative Government was in power no such conflict would arise and that part of the provision would become a dead letter. That is manifestly unfair. But if the House of Commons refuses to pass a Bill
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0168"/>
<col>285</col>
which the House of Lords has sent down, I do not know whether it is contemplated that the House of Lords may ask for an appeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00810"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00811"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Then comes the further proposal that 200 members, or a more suitable number, could ask for a Referendum, as I understand, in the event of the House of Lords and the House of Commons both agreeing upon the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00813"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: That seems a very strong thing, though I agree that it is a mitigation as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. But what is most likely to follow? What has always tended, I think, to follow in such cases is that an initiative is given&#x2014;not merely a power of appeal&#x2014;against both Houses of Parliament, an initiative and an opportunity for individuals&#x2014;the 200 members if you like&#x2014;to claim that the two Houses of Parliament having refused to pass a Bill they shall be able to go over the heads of the two Houses of Parliament and ask the country to approve the Bill. His whole argument rests on a foundation leading to that; and, therefore, this experience shows that those who once begin to touch this thing find that they cannot stop short. What would be the result of that? It is not only that they are crude proposals; but supposing that the Liberals are in power, proposals might be made over the heads of the two Houses to tax certain imports or manufactures, to separate one kind of tax from another, or even to tax land; and their popularity might tempt a good many people to vote for them. Supposing a proposal were made that everybody should pay 50 per cent. of his income over&#x00A3;5,000 a year. No doubt a great part of the population would disregard it, but there would be a considerable temptation to a great number of people to support it. The noble Earl, however, is ready to take risks. He refers to the risks we are supposed to expose the country to in our Bill, which is not yet before us, but he cheerfully takes risks of the kind I have ventured to suggest.<lb/>
There are two deep rooted objections, in my opinion, to the proposals of this Bill and to the principle of the Referendum, or to any Constitutional change which shall enable the Referendum to be had
<col>286</col>
recourse to otherwise than it can be at the present moment. This country needs, and I think generally possesses, stability of government. There is need, if you can get it, of Ministers who should be men of independence and of character, of some degree of moral courage. What would be the position of Ministers when a Bill is carried or rejected over their heads that may strike right athwart the whole policy they are endeavouring to. pursue?&#x2014;because the noble Lord does not limit the scope of Bills which may be so referred. They must resign, surely, and a General Election will probably ensue; and then the other side conic in to be exposed to the same fusillade on the part of the 200 Members who might be entitled not only to protest against refusal, but to initiate Bills themselves.<lb/>
The temptation to the famous 200 Members would be irresistible. They would endeavour to turn out the Government, to discredit it, to expose it to rebuff or humiliation, even if the Ministers were not independent-minded enough to resign. The noble Earl knows both Parties in the House of Commons, and he knows that whenever Members think that a favourable opportunity arises they are not averse from taking advantage of any chance to. damage a Government whose general policy they disapprove. We should have these Referendums&#x2014;I suppose I ought to, say Referenda, though I disapprove of the dog Latin introduced in this controversy&#x2014;these references to the people as often as an opportunity arose. There will be always 200 gentlemen who will be prepared to sacrifice themselves by demanding that the reference shall take place. There would be gusts of passion or of dissatisfaction, say, against a Government which was not popular in respect of its Navy Estimates; and then an opportunity would be taken to discredit them.<lb/>
The Referendum would also be fatal to representative government. The political genius of the English people was the first to discover, and after great difficulty to develop, the real basis of liberty and of self-government in this country&#x2014;a system which has been copied all over the world. Every Referendum is an attack on the representative system. That method which was discovered by the Englishman centuries ago was found out, as indicated by Tacitus in the "Germania," through the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0169"/>
<col>287</col>
chief men deliberating on smaller things while all the people deliberated on the greater matters. But the principle would not work in a great population. It is all very well in the small tribes, but in this country representative institutions mean that the people who have not the time to look into every detail of this or of that Bill should choose men who are honourable, whose judgment may be trusted, and with whose opinions they are in harmony. They are sent to Parliament for the purpose of discussing these matters. I do not say that the system at the present time is working altogether satisfactorily. The position in the House of Commons is one of such congestion that it is almost impossible to do business satisfactorily there; but I say that this method of proceeding, not by direct election, but by representatives is the earliest characteristic of our Constitution. It does ensure the criticism of a Bill and it enables amendments to be considered; it allows postponement for reflection. I wonder how much of that would be present under the Referendum.<lb/>
The noble Earl spoke with considerable warmth of the defects existing in the present constitution of Parliament. All the difficulties are due to the congestion of business in the House of Commons, and are due to the fact that there is much more to do than there is time in which to do it, and if by some scheme of devolution, such as I hope we may see introduced, the House of Commons has more time and more leisure to attend to its business I am perfectly certain these complaints will disappear. What is to be substituted? The people are busy; they have abundant common sense in this country, but no time for detail. They have no opportunity of following arguments, such as we have in Parliament, and they have still less opportunity of considering points and counter points appropriate to the Committee stage of a Bill. You would not have a deliberate and considered opinion of the constituencies. You would have their opinion in big things, on big measures; it would naturally be hasty, it would be naturally crude; yet this is the proposal which is made for the purpose of adjusting the relations between the two Houses. The only result of its use would be as an engine of obstruction. There would be constant references. It would not give you a judgment on the simple issue, such as the noble Earl says it ought to do.<lb/>
<col>288</col>
As I understand it the Bill is to be referred, and I think it is the only way in which you can work your Referendum to refer the Bill as a whole. The whole of the Finance Bill, the Education Bill, and the Licensing Bill would thus be referred; and I speak in no sense with disrespect of the electors, whom I sincerely respect, and whose opinion I am always prepared to accept, when I say that it is a false piece of flattery to pretend that in considering a big measure of this kind, without the opportunity of investigating and discussing its provisions, they are as competent to settle the controversy as the House of Commons and this House under our ordinary forms. I will not express surprise. I have long lost the faculty of being surprised at political matters. I am content to await the next development. My own opinion is that the Referendum will shortly cease to be the popular idol of the noble Earl and his friends, and then, no doubt, we shall have some other proposal, perhaps not so surprising, but, at all events, I hope a little more definite and intelligible.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL ARMY AND HOME<lb/> DEFENCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00837"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to call attention to the discrepancy between the views expressed by the Secretary of State for War and those expressed by the Admiralty in a publication entitled "Compulsory Service," and to ask His Majesty's Government whether they are in a position to state what is the present official view in regard to the functions of the Territorial Army.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00838">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in asking your Lordships to consider for a very short time this book entitled "Compulsory Service" and its treatment of some of the most serious questions of military defence, I confess that we all labour under one very great disadvantage. We had a discussion last week as to the propriety of the form of this particular publication, and I confess that I share very much the feeling which was then expressed by my noble friend below me, Lord Camperdown, that it is difficult to
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0171"/>
<col>291</col>
know how far this publication is official and how far it is not official. The Order in Council which regulates the business of the War Office very closely associates-I think I might almost go as far as to say identifies&#x2014;the Secretary of State with the Army Council. There is, therefore, this great advantage that the public naturally presumes that the policy of the Secretary of State embodies the opinion of his military expert advisers. There is, however, a clause in the Order which enables the Secretary of State to reserve for his own decision any matter, of whatever kind, at his own discretion. I should like to point out how this bears upon this special form of publication. If the Secretary of State had merely expressed his own opinion the natural inference would have been that he was speaking in accord with the Army Council. If the Secretary of State had issued this publication in the form of a Memorandum emanating from the Army Council there could have been no ambiguity at all in the matter. But neither of these courses has been adopted. This publication&#x2014;a very able publication, no doubt&#x2014;has been issued independently of the Army Council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00839"><member>LORD LUCAS:</member><membercontribution> Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00840"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: It contains a Memorandum by a very distinguished officer, Sir Ian Hamilton, who is not a member of the Army Council, and that Memorandum is accompanied in this book by an expression of agreement on the part of the Secretary of State. I do not think it is at all necessary that I should this evening occupy your Lordships' time in considering the points of the discussion last week. I am not concerned to-day with the question as to the convenience or the inconvenience, the propriety or otherwise, of publishing Notes such as appear in this book under the heading "Admiralty Notes" by Sir Arthur Wilson. I do not think I should be speaking unfairly if I said that these Notes partake very largely of the nature of professional advocacy, because they were prepared to assist the Government in a debate which Lord Roberts intended to raise in the autumn of last year, but which, as your Lordships know, owing to the pressure of more important matters, Lord Roberts postponed if the First Sea Lord really desired the publication of the Notes, and was fully prepared to stake his professional
<col>292</col>
reputation, as no doubt he has done, upon them, I do not think it is necessary to say any more on the matter, but, in the public interest, I respectfully dissent from the course which the First Sea Lord has pursued.<lb/>
But this is not a personal question respecting the First Sea Lord. There is a question of the public interest involved. A book of this kind&#x2014;I am sure His Majesty's Government will realise the fact&#x2014;published with the direct support and assistance of one of the most distinguished and important members of His Majesty's Government, cannot be set aside as a purely unofficial and irresponsible document. On the other hand, if the Secretary of State adopted this certainly somewhat unprecedented form of advocacy with regard to a particular policy in order to refute those who differed from him, the inference naturally and reasonably is that the judgment of the Army Council does not coincide with the judgment of the Secretary of State. And for this reason, my Lords. If the views upheld in this book were shared by the military members of the Army Council it is inconceivable, it seems to me, having regard to the use which has been made of Sir Arthur Wilson's Memorandum, that the Secretary of State would not have supported his unprofessional judgment by the professional judgment of his military advisers.<lb/>
I should like to allude to the extraordinary way in which the arguments in this book are wrested from the facts in order to advocate the special views contained in the book. The Secretary of State, in his Memorandum, endorses the opinion of "Master Mariner," an anonymous writer in a contemporary magazine, and describes him as an expert seaman. I do not know who "Master Mariner" is, but I presume that in this respect the Secretary of State has some special information, because he specifically refers to him as an expert seaman. This principle of anonymous writing has been carried to a very great extent. Your Lordships will remember some extremely able and powerful letters which were published in <i>The Times</i> over the signature of "Pacificus." I guarantee that the country supposed that those letters, published as they were in the largest type and given the greatest possible prominence, were written by some Statesman or someone who had great experience in the serious affairs of State. I do not wish to depreciate
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0172"/>
<col>293</col>
those letters, but as I think is known to many of your Lordships they were written by a very able young literary man who, so far front having had any experience of affairs of State, is a prominent member of the firm of Debenham and Freebody. When an anonymous letter in a magazine is seized upon by the Secretary of State and the writer of it described as an expert seaman, we ought to know who that expert seaman is.<lb/>
To refer for one moment to the arguments used by this expert seaman. He calculates that an invading force of 70,000 would need 150 vessels of sorts, or about 200,000 tons of shipping. It is almost incredible that an invading force would desire to use a lot of old tramps. Take the case of two great German lines. The Hamburg - Amerika line could furnish a tonnage of 200,000 with thirteen steamers, and the Norddeutscher Lloyd could furnish a tonnage of 200,000 with fourteen steamers, and when this had been done both lines would still have ocean-going steamers representing a very large tonnage. I mention this because it seems to me to show in what an extraordinary manner facts have been wrested out of their natural consequence in order to build a case against compulsory service. But it is not so much that I want to allude to compulsory service as to show, as I hope I have shown by referring to this case, how ill considered and loosely thought out a great many of the arguments in this book are. I defy anybody, having read and studied this book, to feel otherwise than completely bewildered as to what are to be the functions and duties of the Territorial Force.<lb/>
With your Lordships' permission, I should like to make two or three quotations from this book. The Secretary of State, in his introduction to the second edition, makes use of this language&#x2014;
<quote>"It has been closely considered in the Defence Committee, and the answer is that if the invading force exceeds 70,000 men the operation has no chance of success. Then all that has to be done is to provide against a force of 70,000 men. For the fulfilment of this purpose the Territorial Force is being organised."</quote>
That would appear to coincide with the statement that was made by the Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence about two years ago in the House of Commons, when he said that it was the business of
<col>294</col>
the War Office to provide under all circumstances against a possible invasion of 70,000 men. Then, again, if you turn to Sir Arthur Wilson's Memorandum at the end of the book, what do you find In summing up his conclusions Sir Arthur Wilson makes use of these words&#x2014;
<quote>"Taking all those facts into consideration, the enemy would probably decide, as the Admiralty have done, that an invasion on even the moderate scale of 70,000 men is practically impossible."</quote>
I ask the War Office, How is it possible to reconcile those statements? The fact is that this book, which was compiled with the object of destroying the case for compulsory service, has had and is having a very different influence. In the first place, in this book we find given by its writers a complete answer to the charge, which has been made against compulsory service, that a nation in arms encourages a spirit of Jingoism and militarism. What does Sir Ian Hamilton himself say in this book? He says&#x2014;
<quote>"Compulsory service is less aggressive, less of a danger to the world at large, seeing that by its very nature it is a weapon that cannot be lightly used&#x2026; Under voluntary service the majority of the nation pay for war, not with their persons, but with their purses. For this very reason the bulk of the nation views war with a less tragic regard, and is encouraged to run considerable risks in home defence rather than abate by so much as one square mile of barren waste their Imperial pretensions."</quote>
I do not think you could have a stronger and more forcible argument titan is contained in those words by Sir Ian Hamilton that compulsory service is not associated with, but is really an enemy to, undue military aggression; and if this book has served no other purpose, it has served a great end in the admission which it contains, on military authority, that when all have to fulfil a national duty a nation is steadied and not excited, and is less a prey to those ignoble passions which the unscrupulous politician and journalist can play upon for their own purposes.<lb/>
But if I must express some gratitude for the publication of these opinions of Sir Ian Hamilton, I cannot see what conceivable advantage can be gained by taking, as this book does, all heart out of the patriotic movement for home defence. Remember that upon that spirit rests the strength and development of the Territorial Force. If in a publication bearing the support of the Secretary of State it is openly declared by the First Sea Lord that an
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0173"/>
<col>295</col>
invasion is not practical, you certainly are pouring, in the most effective way possible, an extinguishing dose of cold water upon that warm and patriotic spirit which, under your voluntary system, you have not only to invoke but to keep alive if you wish your Territorial Force to exist at all. Presumably it is desired that the matter of home defence should be, so to speak, shut up in watertight mental compartments to suit political convenience. Is the argument that the Navy is all-sufficient a good and a sound argument and the proper weapon when you have to make a case against compulsory service? And is this same argument that the Navy is all-sufficient to be put on the shelf when you are urging employers and employed to join the Territorial Force? I only ask this evening that the mental confusion which this book has produced should be cleared up by some statement on the part of His Majesty's Government. It is only fair and reasonable that we should have stated with some precision the conditions and the purpose of the Territorial Force. We want some clearness of aim and some clearness of purpose. I therefore beg to ask His Majesty's Government if they are in a position to state what is the present official view in regard to the functions of the Territorial Army?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00841"><member>THE UNDER - SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Loan LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that I find some difficulty in extracting from the speech of the noble Earl the particular discrepancy to which one gathered from the form of his Question his speech was going to be directed to prove. I understand that his position is that he finds in the Admiralty document which has been laid on the Table of your Lordships' House a statement that&#x2014;to quote his own words&#x2014;the Navy is all-sufficient for the purpose of guarding these shores against any possibility of raid or invasion. I would like to ask what kind of a speech the noble Earl would have addressed to your Lordships if on the strength of that document alone we were to come here and say that we were prepared to cease to take any kind of steps for home defence from a military standpoint. Is there to be read into that Admiralty document anything which will justify us in the view&#x2014;and that, after all, is what I understand the noble Earl tries to make out&#x2014;that home defence from a military point of view is henceforward
<col>296</col>
redundant? Does he really think that we could use the statement contained in that document as a pretext for disbanding our home defence Army? I must say that I was surprised to hear a view of that sort emanating from the noble Earl, because he himself has often, when sitting on the front Ministerial Bench, explained to your Lordships the cardinal principles of home defence as we understand them.<lb/>
If I may be pardoned for taking up your Lordships' time, I will restate these principles as shortly as I can. The object of maintaining a military force in this country for the purpose of home defence is to make an enemy who contemplates the invasion of this country come in sufficiently large numbers that it shall be impossible for him to elude the Navy. That is to say, the enemy would have to provide so large a flotilla of transports as to give a sufficiently large target that it would be impossible for the Navy to miss him. If I may express it in another way, I will take the figure that has been given to your Lordships before now&#x2014;to a certain extent it is a hypothetical figure, but it is a figure that has been agreed upon-70,000 men. It is the Army's business to render invasion by a force of less than 70.000 men ineffective, and it is the Navy's business to prevent an invading force of more than 70,000 men reaching these shores. Is there anything contained either in my right hon. friend's preface to the book under discussion or in the Navy Memorandum which is in the least inconsistent with that position? The Admiralty document states that they consider that an invasion on the scale of 70.000 men or more is practically impossible. So much the better. We know that the smaller the force which attempts to reach these shores the more difficult it is for the Navy to intercept them. Therefore, if the Navy is sufficiently strong to reduce the number of the invading force to less than 70,000, and if, on the other hand, our military preparations are adequate, as we believe they are, to repel a force which is not more than 70,000, all requirements are met. As I have previously pointed out, when the Expeditionary Force has left this country, we should have remaining 422,000 men, of whom 100,000 would be Regulars. If, then, the Navy can prevent a force as large as 70,000 from raiding these shores, and the Army is competent to deal with a force of at least 70,000, that gives you no in-

<col>297</col>
consistency, but only a certain amount of overlapping in the safety required. If the position has changed in any way&#x2014;and I do not: think anything published in this book has changed the position in the least bit&#x2014;it is that the margin of safety is ample; but to say that the Territorial Force is not required, as I understood the noble Earl to argue from this Memorandum&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

The point is that, we have it now stated, on the highest authority, that 70,000 men cannot land.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00845"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: That is not saying that it is impossible. There is nothing in the Memorandum which alters our military position in the slightest degree, nor is there anything in it which detracts from the vital necessity for the safety of this country of maintaining the Territorial Force as it is maintained at the present moment. Therefore the functions of the Territorial Force remain exactly as they were stated by the noble Earl in this House, and as we have frequently stated them since. First, it is necessary to have a Home Defence Force for repelling small rails. Secondly, it is necessary to have this force in order to make the enemy, if he contemplated serious invasion, come with a force of not less than 70,000 men. The third function of the Territorial Force is contained in Section 13 of the Act, under which His Majesty may accept the voluntary offer of units or of members of the force to serve outside the United Kingdom. Those are the functions of the Territorial Force, and they have remained unchanged ever since the force was first instituted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00846"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, put quite shortly I think that the reply of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War may be condensed into the following proposition&#x2014;that the Territorial Force exists as a sort of bait for the purpose of drawing
<col>298</col>
70,000 men to this country who are thereupon to be annihilated by our Navy. I do not care in the least whether the publications which have been alluded to this evening are constitutional or unconstitutional, regular or irregular. Personally I welcome them with enthusiasm, because they show most obviously the straits to which the Secretary of State for War is reduced in the endeavour to manufacture a case against compulsory service.<lb/>
It is perfectly easy to see what occurred. The Secretary of State for War went to Sir Ian Hamilton and obviously said to him: "Things are getting very awkward. Lord Roberts and his friends are making considerable headway. Clear thinking does not seem to go down as well as it used to; in fact, I am rather gravelled for argument. Now I have done a great deal for you. I have boomed you in the House of Commons, and my Under-Secretary has boomed you a good deal in the House of Lords. Suppose you do something for me. Suppose you write a book to back me up." And I presume Sir Ian Hamilton replied: "It is rather awkward for me to do this, because not so very long ago 1 think I gave vent to a good many expressions in favour of universal compulsory service. But I will tell you what 1 will do. I will write a book and describe the sort of thing that nobody wants and that nobody proposes to introduce into this country, and I will show how very undesirable it is. After all, I can construct an imaginary bogey as well as anybody else and knock it down." Sir Ian Hamilton thereupon produced his book. He did his best for the right hon. gentleman, and a very poor best it is.<lb/>
But the Secretary of State for War, nothing daunted, then falls back on a fresh expedient. He evidently goes to the First Sea Lord and says to him, more or less in the same language: "These compulsory service people are extremely troublesome. I have turned on Sir Ian Hamilton, but still they go on adding to their numbers and their arguments seem getting stronger. Now I want you to do something for me." I suppose that Sir Arthur Wilson replied very much in the same kind of way. He probably said: "Well, I am only a simple seaman. I don't understand very much about this kind of thing, but if you are very anxious for me to oblige I will tell you what I will do. I will write a preface
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0175"/>
<col>299</col>
or something of that kind, and I will assume that all the sense is on one side and all the ignorance on the other, that all the principles are on one side and all the want of principles on the other, and then I will show that, in these circumstances, we have nothing to be afraid of; and in order to do the thing thoroughly I will put at the end of my Memorandum the initials ' A. K. W.,' and you will be able to use it in any way you like. It can be official, or private, or semi-official, or demi-semiofficial."<lb/>
Nobody has admired more than I have the continual ingenuity of the present Secretary of State for War. He did what I think no other politician has ever succeeded in doing&#x2014;he obtained the services of his political opponents on his own behalf; he even turned a sensational play into an advertisement for the Territorial Force; and he very nearly succeeded in persuading the whole of his countrymen to join in a general supplication to Heaven on behalf of this portion of the task in which lie was particularly interested. But I do not know that he has attained much success by this last expedient of employing distinguished naval and military advisers in the character of electioneering pamphleteers. I may be wrong, but personally I never attach overwhelming importance to the isolated opinions of these naval and military advisers. It always strikes me that "advisers" is hardly the right term to use, because these professional gentlemen are really the satellites of their Parliamentary chiefs, and if they presumed to differ from their Parliamentary chiefs it is quite clear to me that they would very soon cease to be "advisers," and would have to look out for something else to do. They are, in fact, only advisers so long as they agree with the policy of their Parliamentary chiefs. If they were allowed to issue Minutes disagreeing with their political and Parliamentary chiefs, we might pay considerable attention to what they say; but, of course, that is a phenomenon which we never by any chance experience. In this particular case I am not in the least impressed by these two isolated authorities, because it is perfectly plain that, whatever their own personal opinions may be, they are at variance with the opinions of the enormous majority of experts, whether they be military or naval, who are in the British Service.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00847"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not know when I came down to the House this evening that the advice which was given by "Master Mariner" to the Secretary of State for War would be referred to. The difficulties of invasion are very great, but that is no reason whatever why they should be exaggerated. "Master Mariner" has manifestly exaggerated the difficulties. He assumes that an invading army would bring with them everything that an army could possibly want. We often see advertisements concerning things which we are told "no traveller should be without," but those are generally the things which a wise traveller leaves behind. "Master Mariner" assumes that an invading army would bring with them all-the necessary wagons and horses. What they would bring with them would be plenty of ammunition and also harness for the horses which they would procure on arrival in this country; and after they had landed but a very short time the enemy's Cavalry would be as well horsed as the Territorial Artillery is at the present moment. The amount of tonnage that an invading force would require would not be more than one ton per man. It would be interesting if we could know how much tonnage per man was employed by the only successful invaders of Great Britain, Julius C&#x00E6;sar and William the Conqueror. Men in our days are no bigger than they were then and there has been no change in their requirements, and I venture to think that a soldier in the time of C&#x00E6;sar carried about as much as the modern soldier. There is, however, one grain of comfort in what Mr. Haldane said concerning the advice of "Master Mariner," inasmuch as he declared that his War Office advisers did not agree with "Master Mariner" on all points. As I have said, the invasion of this country is an extremely difficult problem, and the difficulty of invasion increases in a greater proportion than the number of men employed&#x2014;for instance, it is far more than twice as difficult to bring 100,000 men than to bring 50,000 men and so on&#x2014;but that is no reason why the difficulty should be exaggerated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00848"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships must have congratulated yourselves afresh this evening upon the fact that the absence of any rule of order in this Assembly permits of a number of speeches upon subjects not directly connected with the one immediately
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0176"/>
<col>301</col>
before the House. We have heard comparatively little of the discrepancy mentioned by the noble Earl in his Question on the Paper. On the other hand, we-have had an interesting little speech from the noble Lord who has just sat down, from whose first words I had hoped we were going to discover the author of the article signed "Master Mariner." Then we had one of those brilliant flights of imagination from Lord Newton to which we are accustomed in this House. He told us he had not very much faith in these advisers of whom we hear a good deal. I am not surprised, because I think he belongs to that small band of members of your Lordships' House, headed by the noble Duke (the Duke of Bedford) on the Back Bench, who think that the only possible defence for this country in time of war will be an Army which shall consist of nobody but colonels of Militia, and that this Army, consisting of colonels and commanded by colonels, will be amply sufficient to repel any force which might reach this country. The other subject, the authorship of the letters signed "Pacificus," I do not think it is necessary to trouble your Lordships with on this occasion, as we are expecting an important debate on a very different topic to follow. I will, therefore, content myself by briefly stating the position. The Admiralty view is that an invasion with even 70,000 men is practically impossible, but the War Office, in order to allow a margin of safety and thereby to make the position absolutely safe, say that they regard 70.000 as the possible maximum. I think that on consideration, the noble Earl will sec that the use of the same figure by the two Departments, though used in a different way, involves no real discrepancy, except in so far as it represents the margin of safety which it is thought right by the War Office they should provide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00849"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Earl has said, your Lordships are expecting an important debate to follow, and therefore I will not trouble you for more than two minutes. I cannot help thinking that your Lordships are in some difficulty this afternoon from the fact that the noble Earl, absolutely within his right, has thought fit to raise this discussion. We had a discussion on this subject only twelve days ago, when the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, expressed the views that are held on this Bench, and
<col>302</col>
your Lordships will also remember that we are promised a very important full-dress debate on this subject on April 3, on the Motion of Lord Roberts, at which time I have no doubt many of your Lordships will be anxious to exchange the familiar arguments we have heard so often between the views of my noble friend behind me and his League, and the views of those of us who do not agree with him. I therefore feel that it is a pity that this subject should be discussed in driblets, if I may use the word. I think we should confine ourselves as much as possible to the full-dress debate. I hope the noble Earl feels that he has received information from the Under-Secretary as to the functions of the Territorial Army. The noble Lord said that the functions for which the Territorial Army was designed had been in no way changed. Therefore I have no doubt the noble Earl (Lord Portsmouth), who was in charge in this House of the Bill which created the Territorial Army, feels that he has got all the information for which he asked. Questions on this point were asked several times in the course of the debate which took place on that- Bill, but I cannot remember that we got the information we wanted, though, of course, we were met by the noble Earl (Lord Portsmouth), the then Under-Secretary of State for War, with an obvious desire to help us in any way he could. The noble Earl in bringing this subject before your Lordships to-day has made one thing quite clear, and I certainly agree with him that this custom which His Majesty's Government have started of issuing semi-official documents is most unfortunate. It has, I imagine, always been the practice of Governments to try and secure that when official documents are laid on the Table they are official documents. This system of getting particular officials or supporters of the Government to write essays to prove a particular thing and then publishing them in a semi-official way is, as I have said, most unfortunate. You cannot expect the public to feel confidence in trying to understand a question properly from documents emanating from the Government unless they are official. The documents we are discussing are of a semiofficial character. I think at most other times they would have been described, and rightly, as leakages, and as such one would have felt more satisfied if they had been discouraged and not encouraged by the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00850"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> rose to call attention to the proposed Reciprocity Agreement between Canada and the United States, and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00851">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope I may be allowed, although I am only an insignificant member of this House, to give expression to the feeling, which I am sure is shared by every member of the House, of deep regret at the absence of the noble Earl the Leader of the House, and particularly at the cause of that absence. Circumstances upon which it would not be proper for me to dilate have imposed upon the noble Earl an intolerable burden of work and responsibility, greater, I believe, than any man could have borne, and we have all admired in the most unfeigned manner the great gallantry with which he has devoted himself to that task and the cheerful equanimity with which he has borne the burden until health and strength failed him. We condole with noble Lords opposite on the temporary loss of their Leader, and we hope that the period of his absence will be very short indeed, because we all&#x2014;I am sure noble Lords on this side will allow me to speak for them&#x2014;equally feel the absence of the noble Earl from the discussions in this House. I also regret that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is not present this evening owing to indisposition, for I am sure your Lordships will agree that there is no member of this House whose opinion, on this particular subject, is more valuable or more important.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00852">I must first safeguard myself against misapprehensions and misrepresentations on the part of noble Lords opposite, which experience of former discussion in this House leads me to expect. I am well aware that the Dominion of Canada is under responsible government and that Canada has the right, as much as we have the right, to make any commercial Treaty or arrangement which she pleases. Nothing, therefore, is further from my intention than to make any complaint against the action of the Canadian Government. I cannot, however, agree with those who suggest that the arrangements which any of the Dominions may make in regard to their external trade are no concern of ours. Canada would be the last to make that claim, for no other Dominion has so fully
<col>304</col>
and generously recognised the mutual obligations of partners in the Empire. It would have been impossible to take a more loyal and friendly view of that partnership than that which Canada has persistently taken for forty years and more, in spite of the coldness with winch we have received her advances. When therefore, Canada finds herself obliged to make a Treaty with a foreign nation which will lessen the advantages which she has been giving to us, surely it is the strangest perversity to say that there is nothing which we could do or could have done to dissuade her.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00853">Canada has freely given us preference in commerce which is admitted by all to be a great advantage to us, and although we have given her no preference in return she has made no complaint and no urgent demand. She has merely expressed, with exceeding modesty, her hope that some day we might see our way to do so. For thirty years past it has been the policy of Canada to direct her trade towards the British Empire rather than towards the United States, and her whole economic development has been shaped to that end. This is how that great Canadian Statesman, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, described Canada's "National" policy at the Imperial Conference in 1907&#x2014;
<quote>"If we were to follow the laws of nature and geography between Canada and the United States, the whole trade would flow from South to North and from North to South. We have done everything possible, by building canals and subsidising railways, to bring the trade from West to East and East to West, so as to bring trade into British Channels."</quote>
And, again, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no boundary line except a purely convential one over the whole Territory of North America. Their habits are the same as ours, and therefore we are induced to trade, and cannot help it, by the force of nature. But so far as legislation can influence trade, we have done everything possible to push our trade towards the British people and against the American people."</quote>
No response was made by the British Government until Mr. Chamberlain became Colonial Secretary, and, with his farsighted statesmanship, pointed out to us the immense potential advantages of a United Empire. The Treaties with Belgium and the German Zollverein were then denounced, and Canada in 1898 adopted the policy of British Preference, which became the cardinal principle of the Canadian fiscal system. At the same time she abandoned the standing offer of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0178"/>
<col>305</col>
reciprocity in national products with the United States which had appeared in every Canadian Tariff Bill for a generation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00854">Sir Wilfrid Laurier, at the Imperial Conference of 1907, said in regard to the Preference&#x2014;
<quote>"We have told the British people that there is a way or doing more. There is the preference of mutual trade, and this is what we had in view when we adopted in 1902 the Resolution of that year."</quote>
In these circumstances it is fatuous to say that the present startling change of policy is something which we could not have prevented and which is no concern of ours. Canada has been forced, either by the inaction or the action, we know not which, of His Majesty's Government, to abandon this national policy and to offer to the United States some of the advantages which she has been so freely giving to us and for which we have hardly thanked her. This change of attitude must have far-reaching effects on the trade and policy of the British Empire of which His Majesty's Ministers are the responsible guardians. The most important of those effects are&#x2014;(1) the entire removal of the preference on certain British commodities such as galvanized sheets, rolled sheets, Canada plates, glycerine; (2) the material reduction of preference on other. British commodities, such as cutlery, confectionery, biscuits, plate glass, motor cars and parts, certain leather goods, and cement; (3) the increase in the area of British competition in the Canadian market by reason of the "most favoured nation" obligations, which compel Canada to extend to a number of foreign countries the concessions which are to be granted to the United States; (4) the subjection of British goods in the United States market to higher rates of duty than are granted to competitive Canadian goods. In the year 1909&#x2013;10 the amount of the goods which will be affected if the Agreement is ratified was &#x00A3;2,999,000. This last is the most startling change of policy, for it introduces for the first time a differentiation between the several States of the Empire in their trade with a foreign country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00855">But, my Lords, this is not all. It is not merely a commercial matter; it is also a political matter. The commercial union of Canada and the United States must inevitably lead to their political union. Our Statesmen, Canadian Statesmen,
<col>306</col>
American Statesmen, and the present British Ambassador at Washington have all foreseen and foretold that consequence. We have had actual experience during the former Reciprocity Treaty between Canada and the United States, from 1854 to 1866, to prove the correctness of those views. And now what is the astounding situation with which we are confronted, and which would arouse shame and indignation throughout this country if it were properly understood? The situation is this. The responsible Statesmen of a foreign country have spoken openly, without protest from His Majesty's Government and without fear of such protest, of the future annexation of a portion of the Dominions of the Crown. That is the pass to which the action or inaction, whichever it may be, of His Majesty's Government has brought us. No such outrage would be possible as between any other two countries, and if such an outrage had been perpetrated it would have been the matter of immediate protest. There is&#x2014;thank Heaven &#x0021;&#x2014;no ill will, indeed nothing but goodwill, between the people of the United States of America and ourselves. These remarks were the remarks of individuals, but since those individuals were responsible Statesmen they ought to have been made the subject of dignified protest. But His Majesty's Government have remained silent, and the British Ambassador is said to have laughed. I can well believe that the disruption of the Empire might be a cause of satisfaction and merriment to Mr. Bryce in his personal capacity if that calamity were the necessary consequence of Radical Party policy. But Mr. Bryce is British Ambassador, and the guardian in America of British honour and the integrity of British interests. I can well believe that His Majesty's Ministers would view with unconcern the dismemberment of the Empire just as they contemplate the disruption of the United Kingdom as necessary to their Party aims. But they are the King's Ministers, and responsible, first of all, for national and Imperial interests.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00856">What we want to know therefore, and what we must know is whether this humiliating and disastrous situation has been brought about by anything His Majesty's Government have clone or by anything they have left undone, whether it has been deliberate or the accidental result of shortsighted and blundering statesmanship. Thus far the Government
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0179"/>
<col>307</col>
have kept us in the dark. Their replies to questions have been evasive and inconsistent. They have not taken the people of this country into their confidence. They have withheld information, which they ought to have published long ago, until they have been forced by public pressure to publish it. What is the meaning of this secretive action and want of candour in a matter which vitally concerns the nation and the Empire? We want to know what instructions the Government gave to the British Ambassador. We want to know whether they have informed Canada of the bearing of reciprocity on Empire policy. We want to know whether they have endeavoured to obtain the same terms in the American market for British manufacturers and exporters in the United Kingdom as will be granted to British manufacturers and exporters in Canada.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00857">But first of all we want to know why the country was not informed of what was going on? Why was there first reticence and then reluctant dilatory and shuffling response to inquiry? What has been the difficulty about giving information? What on earth is the Board of Trade for, and why have they been unable to do what a non-official body like the Tariff Commission, with infinitely smaller resources and facilities, have been able to do? Traders and manufacturers all over the country have been complaining that they cannot get information, and the obvious thing which ought to have been done was to hold consultation between the Commercial Committee of the Board of Trade and the Chambers of Commerce to ascertain the bearing of the alteration in the rates of duty. Why was this not done? We have a right to some explanation. Perhaps you will say that you have published three White Papers. Well, let us go into that. Lord Grey's cable message, which contained a very good summary of the schedules, was received on January 27, but it made no public appearance until a fortnight later and then only in an obscure Board of Trade Journal. The first White Paper, which was a reprint of that cable message, was not published until three weeks after the cablegram had been received. The second White Paper, which was published two days after that, contained merely the addition of the schedules. The third White Paper, which was not published until March 3, gave us at last the very important letters explaining
<col>308</col>
the Agreement. Thus the country was kept waiting for five weeks before any real information on this most important matter was disclosed, and it was only given then in response to great pressure in Parliament and in the Press.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00858">The case is even worse than that. The Government must have been in possession of both the Agreement and schedules before the announcement on January 26. The Prime Minister stated, in the House of Commons on February 8, that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Agreement was made with the knowledge of His Majesty's Ambassador at Washington, who reported to the Foreign Office before it was signed."</quote>
That statement was cautious and indefinite, but if we compare with it the statement made by M. Lemieux, the Canadian Postmaster-General, to the effect that the British Government had approved of the Agreement, we see that you must have had it. Why, then, did you not publish it? There could have been, and there ought to have been, simultaneous publication. Perhaps you will say, as the Prime Minister has suggested, that this is a purely Canadian matter. If you do, we can only regard such an answer as nonsense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00859">This Agreement involves a tremendous change in the policy of the Empire. It means that for the first time within fifty years a State of the Empire will receive a preference not enjoyed by Great Britain. It is well to remember that in 1892 Canada declined a similar Agreement with the United States which would have given her special advantages. Nor can you say that it is small matter, for the volume of trade affected amounts to nearly three millions. To that extent, therefore, work and wages in this country will be affected, and our working classes will be paying for a preference accorded to a foreign country. You say that you object to Imperial Preference because, according to your obsolete Cobdenite superstitions, it would raise the price of food in this country, but it is your refusal to accept mutual preference which is going to make the British working man's food cost him more. And with it all you are going to make the first breach in Imperial unity, and you are doing this with your eyes open, for there are no two opinions as to the inevitable consequences of this Agreement. The opinion held by all Statesmen is the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0180"/>
<col>309</col>
same as that of your own Ambassador given as a fully considered prediction in his book on the American Commonwealth, and repeated in the new edition which was published while these negotiations were actually going on.
<quote>"The material growth of Canada" [wrote Mr. Bryce] "would probably be quickened by union, and the plan of a Commercial League or Customs Union which has lately been discussed might, if carried out, lead to a political union; indeed, it is hard to see how otherwise Canada could have her fair share in adjusting such tariff changes as might from time to time become necessary."</quote>
Are you quite sure that the British people are willing to sacrifice Imperial unity to those worn-out superstitions, those bogies of so-called Free Trade, which have been serving the Party purposes of Radicalism? Are you sure that the people of this country would have wished to force this complete change of national policy on the sister Dominion of Canada rather than raise a finger to help her?</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00860">In any circumstances you ought to have asked the people. You knew what was going on during the election. Why did you not ask the people then? That was an opportunity which you would have taken if there had been any courage and sincerity or any forethought and statesmanship in your counsels, if you had not openly and flagrantly proclaimed that with you Party interests come first. You did not do so; yon pursued a policy of deliberate silence and secrecy because you knew that if you had put the case fairly and squarely before the electorate they would not have approved of the game which you were playing. It is on a par with the rest of your policy, which is to deprive the people of any fair opportunity of forming an opinion on your measures. Do you really suppose that the working classes are so devoted to the abstract doctrine of Free Trade that rather than abjure it they would see supplies of food turned away from these shores and work and wages which they might have had given to the Americans? The idea is ridiculous.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00861">My Lords, His Majesty's Ministers, by their unaccountably secretive conduct in this matter, have exposed themselves to grave suspicion. They have laid themselves open to the most serious charge which could possibly be brought against Ministers of the Crown&#x2014;the charge of having deliberately and for their own ends
<col>310</col>
jeopardised the integrity of the Dominions of the Crown. The Prime Minister himself has let the cat out of the bag by the indecent jubilation with which he remarked&#x2014;
<quote>"I think that we are celebrating the obsequies of that which used to be called Imperial Preference."</quote>
That, and the subsequent observation that Imperial Preference is&#x2014;
<quote>"one of the greatest and most disastrous of political impostures of modern times"</quote>
is a nice polite way of addressing the Statesmen of the Colonies who have been offering us their hands across the seas. It is those remarks, utterly unworthy as they are of British statesmanship, which justify our suspicions, and leave us little room to doubt that His Majesty's Ministers have acted in accordance with the infamous boast of their egregious colleague and once more "banged, barred and bolted the door" in the face of the Colonies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00862">Can we be quite sure that they have not been playing the same game elsewhere? Will the noble Lord who replies on behalf of the Government give us an assurance that no similar attempts have been made in Australia and South Africa to kill imperial Preference in order that the Radical Party may rejoice over further obsequies? His Majesty's Government can only clear themselves of suspicion by putting their cards on the table. We want to see every Despatch and every Instruction. If it has all been open and above board, why all this hesitation? Why is it necessary to make a selection of the Papers? Surely it cannot be that the delay is due to any necessity of bowdlerising the Despatches? We want to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and it is with that object that I move for Papers.</p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00864"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on this side of the House are very grateful to my noble friend for the tribute he has paid to the Leader of the House. The House well knows how deeply we on this sidle feel the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0181"/>
<col>311</col>
prospect&#x2014;I hope not for a long time&#x2014;of Lord Crewe's absence from our deliberations, and it is evident that in every quarter of the House there is as deep a feeling as there is on this side of the loss that we sustain through the absence of his sagacity, his pleasant humour, and all the other gifts of which he is the possessor; and there never was a time when the absence of a Leader of Lord Crewe's qualities was felt to be a greater loss to the service of the House and of more unhappy detriment to the public interests.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I turn with no satisfaction to the speech with which my noble friend followed that opening. A long time ago a young man came to me and asked whether I could provide him with journalistic employment. I said to him, "What is your strong point? Have you any?" "Yes," he replied, "I have. My strong point is invective." I pressed him and asked "any particular invective?" and he replied, "No, general invective"; and that appears to be the master faculty displayed on the present occasion at all events by my noble friend. He has charged the Government with being insincere. That perhaps is not very grave nowadays. Then he said that we were playing a game"; that we were showing" a fatuous, blundering statesmanship," and that instead of being honest at the General Election and asking the constituencies whom our candidates were wooing whether they approved or disapproved of the action of a Colony, a responsible Colony&#x2014;that that was "a trick" on our part. I should have thought very ill of any gentleman who was a candidate for the House of Commons who went to a constituency and tried to get votes, whether he belonged to the Party opposite or to our Party, by a denunciation of the policy of the Canadian Ministers at Washington. I pass over all that language, of which I cannot think that my noble friend's colleagues entirely approved.<lb/>
I should like to give a plain and simple statement of the case which the noble Lord has painted in such extraordinarily lurid and not over-intelligible colours. The negotiations leading up to Reciprocity between the Canadian Government and the Government of the United States began nearly a year ago. The first step was a communication from the Secretary of the
<col>312</col>
State Department at Washington to Mr. Bryce. And. by the way, 1 think I ought not to mention the name of Mr. Bryce without protesting with all the warmth of which I am capable against the tone and language of my noble friend about our Ambassador. It was entirely unjust, and even if it had been less grossly unjust than it was, it was not very becoming to denigrate the character of His Majesty's representatives abroad, especially when they happen to be of the eminence of Mr. Bryce. The first step was a communication from the Secretary of the State Department at Washington to Mr. Bryce, and Mr. Bryce referred the communication to the Government of Canada for their consideration. From then onwards the negotiations were continued directly between the Ministers of the Canadian Government and the officials of the State Department at Washington, and His Majesty's Ambassador rendered to the Canadian delegates all the assistance within his power in conducting their negotiations with the American officers.<lb/>
Does my noble friend think that this is a new state of things&#x2014;that the position of His Majesty's Ambassador ill a case of this kind is unprecedented? He is entirely mistaken if lie thinks anything of the kind. Mr. Bryce has frequently during recent years rendered to Canadian Ministers the assistance that he has lately rendered to the Canadian delegates, and they have expressed their particular gratitude to Mr. Bryce for the services he has rendered. In the present case the noble Lord asks whether instructions were given to Mr. Bryce. I have to reply that no instructions were sent to him by the Government, and that no special request was made by the Canadian Government for assistance, for it is regarded as a matter of course that when Canadian Ministers go to Washington they receive the assistance of His Majesty's Ambassador there. The right to that is one to which, as we all know, every British subject is entitled, and it would be ludicrous to suppose that it would not be granted in the case of the Canadian delegates. All that Mr. Bryce has done has had, has, and will have the full approval of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
What I am now going to say ought, I submit, to end the discussion. My noble friend winds up, according to his Notice on the Paper, by a demand for the pro-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0182"/>
<col>313</col>
duction of Papers. He will be glad to know that we propose as soon as possible to lay all the papers before Parliament. They will show that Mr. Bryce, who has been so wrongly accused of having played an anti-patriotic part, took no direct action in the actual negotiations between the Canadian Ministers and the United States officers. This is not the first time within quite recent years that there have been negotiations carried on by delegates from Canada with foreign countries on behalf of the Canadian Government, and in all those cases the delegates have received the assistance of the Minister or Ambassador accredited by us to that foreign country. For example, in 1907 delegates were sent by Canada to Tokyo to try and conclude an arrangement with the Japanese Government with regard to emigration between Japan and Canada. The Canadian delegates received all possible help from His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo, and it was largely due to the Ambassador's assistance that an agreement satisfactory to those two Governments was arrived at, the Canadian Government being the first to acknowledge the part played by the Ambassador at Tokyo.<lb/>
There is another case I should like to mention. In the same year the Canadian Government intimated to His Majesty's Government their desire to open negotiations for a new Commercial Convention with France. His Majesty's Ambassador in Paris was instructed&#x2014;there is a difference there, no doubt&#x2014;to give all the assistance he could to facilitate the negotiations in Paris. They were conducted between the Canadian Minister and the delegates and the Government of the French Republic, and His Majesty's Ambassador in Paris was kept informed, just as Mr. Bryce has been, by the delegates of the progress of the negotiations. It is not worth while bringing forward more illustrations of the undoubted fact, which the Papers will abundantly show, that the action taken by Mr. Bryce was according to precedent, was justified by precedent, and did not constitute a new departure at all. The assistance he gave was to the negotiators of a responsible Government of a British Dominion, acting, remember, entirely within its own competence, and it is not competent for noble Lords here or for gentlemen in another place to impugn the right of the Canadian Government to enter into these negotiations or to frame
<col>314</col>
their own policy which these negotiations were directed to further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00865"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: May I ask who has impugned their right?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00866"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I admit that perhaps my noble friend did not refuse them the right. But it comes to-something very near that if you are to make a Party cry at elections against the Canadian Government, and level against them the accusation&#x2014;for which, when you study-the Papers, you will find there is not a shadow of foundation&#x2014;that they are: willingly and with their eyes open sacrificing important points of fiscal and commercial policy. As. I have said, various commercial negotiations have taken place between Canada and foreign countries, and have been concluded without the assistance or the influence, certainly in one case, of His Majesty's Home Government. I should like to mention three other cases. There was a Commercial Agreement between Canada and Germany in 1910. When the negotiations were concluded the Agreement was signed by the Canadian Minister of Finance and the German Consul at Montreal. In 1910, also, there was an Agreement between Canada and Italy, and there again the negotiations were carried on between the Canadian Minister and the Italian Consul in Canada. Finally, there was a Commercial Agreement between Canada and Belgium in 1910, concluded by an exchange of Notes between the Canadian Minister of Finance and the Belgian Consul-General. I am prepared to maintain that there is really no case for the line taken, and still less for the tone adopted by the noble Lord to-night. At all events I submit to your Lordships that it would be quite premature to open what is called a full-dress discussion upon the merits or demerits, the advantages or disadvantages, of this Reciprocity Agreement until you have seen the Papers and until the Agreement has become much nearer to being an Executive Act than it is now.<lb/>
As to Preference, no doubt your Lordships would be very glad to have an opportunity of opening that great chapter of debate; but I submit that this is about the most unfavourable occasion&#x2014;I do not say that because am afraid of the discussion&#x2014;for opening and carrying on a debate of that character. It would be obviously premature to enter into any discussion of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0183"/>
<col>315</col>
the effect of the Reciprocity Agreement as regards the United States and as regards the most-favoured-nation treatment until the Agreement actually comes into force. There will be plenty to be said on that when your Lordships are in possession of the Papers. Meanwhile the noble Lord does us a great injustice if he supposes for a moment that any member or supporter of the Government takes the view that what Canada does is no concern of ours. I do not belong to the same political school as my noble friend, but in my most extreme moments of antipathy to some of the views lie holds I have never been capable of committing myself&#x2014;and I do not think any member of the Government has committed himself&#x2014;to the view that the economic and fiscal procedure of the Canadian Government is no affair of ours.<lb/>
One other point. The noble Lord said: "This is not merely a commercial arrangement, it is a political arrangement, and it is sure to end in political annexation." "And you," the noble Lord continued speaking of us, "do not protest against it and do not object to it." What right has he to make any statement of that kind? If lie had read, as carefully as some of us have read, the language used in the American Congress and in the Canadian Parliament, he would find that the most responsible men both in the United States and in Canada have laughed at all that talk. If ultimately at some remote day, a generation hence, political effects happen, they will not be the results of this Reciprocity Agreement, though they may be in the fulness of time the results of general causes. I think I have satisfied my noble friend in my statement that we will lay the Papers an the Table as early as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00867"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I am sure every Member of the House will regret that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is not able to be in his place, more especially as I know how much he would have desired to associate himself with the language so admirably used by Lord Ampthill with regard to the absence of Lord Crewe. There is not a man on these Benches, or in any part of the House, who does not agree with every word that fell from Lord Ampthill and the noble Viscount opposite on that subject.<lb/>
After the speech of the Lord President,
<col>316</col>
it might be assumed, unless someone rose from this Bench, that there was some indifference on the part of the noble Marquess and those associated with him as to the importance of the subject before the House. I cannot exaggerate the importance, indeed the gravity, which we attach to this question. The noble Viscount, in his somewhat grave censure on the noble Lord behind me, accused my noble friend of using strong language, the language of invective. In another place, where I have spent a great many years in company with the noble Viscount, I do not think that my noble friend's language would have been considered excessively strong. My noble friend was, I think, altogether guiltless of one charge which the noble Viscount sought to fasten upon him. He most clearly, at the outset of his speech, expressed his entire concurrence in the right of the Canadian Government to made this Agreement. My noble friend did not censure or criticise them, but devoted himself entirely to censuring His Majesty's Government for having put the Canadian Government in a position which made it very difficult for them to refuse such an Agreement.<lb/>
Our feeling is strongly of that character. We have not ventured a word of criticism of any sort or description of the Canadian Government, and we should be very sorry if any word which fell from us on this Bench could be interpreted in Canada as grudging any advantage which may be obtained by the great concessions which they have in certain respects obtained from the American Government. You cannot give fiscal independence to such a nation as the Canadian people without desiring that they should use it to the best of their advantage. Our estimate of the results of the Agreement may be somewhat different from that of the Government. It may be also, perhaps, a little different from that of my noble friend behind me. My noble friend went a long distance in his apprehensions that commercial union must lead to political union. It would not be fair that that opinion should go out unchallenged from this side of the House. We do not look upon commercial union as the pioneer in the path of political union, though we do feel strongly that commercial union often has cemented political union. But that is a very different matter from believing that it must lead necessarily to political disintegration.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0184"/>
<col>317</col>
And in that particular I cannot help thinking that my noble friend has been a little misled as regards the attitude of Mr. Bryce. We on this side of the House have not always seen eye to eye with Mr. Bryce on political matters in this country, but I think I should be wanting in duty if I did not say that, so far as my personal observation goes and that of my colleagues whom I have been able to consult, nothing whatever has passed since Mr. Bryce became Ambassador in America which in any way derogates from his position as the representative of the British Crown. I can say from personal knowledge, because I happened to visit Canada a short time ago, that Mr. Bryce has gained considerable confidence in Canada. I am strongly of the belief that if Mr. Bryce's actions had been such, and if his opinions were such, as my noble friend believes, he would not have gained and most certainly would not retain that confidence. I only say that because I should be very much concerned, as I believe all members of this House would be, if it were felt that His Majesty's Ambassador had in any way departed from the precise and proper attitude which he would naturally have had to take in so delicate a business as that in which he has been recently engaged.<lb/>
I think that the speech of the Lord President to-night will go some distance in the direction of dispelling the view that His Majesty's Government have looked on at these proceedings without sufficient sense of their gravity, but I cannot altogether exonerate His Majesty's Government in this respect. The noble Viscount has asked us to withhold our opinions until we see the Papers. On anything which concerns the actual Treaty or Agreement I entirely and gladly take his counsel; but one thing I think I must be allowed to say in support of what has fallen from my noble friend. You have had, five years of office, which have been most critical in the history of Canada. For thirty years the policy of Canada has been in one direction. Ever since the days of Sir John Macdonald, Canada has been constructing railways from East to West, and the whole stream of her trade has been laid on Imperial lines. During the last ten years the development of Canada has gone on hand over hand. Questions in Canada have become more of Western Canada, whereas fifteen or twenty
<col>318</col>
years ago they were questions of Eastern Canada, and no Government can altogether dissociate itself from the responsibility of watching, and, so far as it can, of guiding and helping the development of a Colony or a Dominion in a British direction.<lb/>
But what have His Majesty's Government done during that period? I do not think I should be overstating it; if I said that the Ministers of George III looked very lightly, as we think now, on fiscal matters in America, and that the Ministers of George V have looked too lightly, as we think, on fiscal arrangements which are going on upon the other side of the Atlantic. The language used in this country, as my noble friend has said, has been unwise and provocative, but it has never been in any way discountenanced by any member of the Government. There has been no actual hostility, such as we all know took place in the past, but a passive hostility has been shown to anything like a Commercial Agreement, and the constant reiteration of unwise and uncalled for expressions is, I think, coming home to roost. It was, I believe, suggested from this Bench some years ago, before I had the honour of a seat in this House, that these expressions, coming from men in high authority, especially from one holding office in the Colonial Office, would involve evil results on the fortunes of the country. I do feel that in that respect the sources of Canadian sentiment have been deflected, and the stream has to a considerable extent been turned in a wrong direction.<lb/>
We shall look forward with very great interest to the Papers, which may tell us one of two things. We have yet to learn what may be the effect on British trade of the American revision of tariff&#x2014;a general revision, apart from this Agreement&#x2014;which, we understand, is to take place. It is certainly an argument which we Tariff Reformers cannot altogether miss, that a much smaller nation than ours should have been able to obtain such great preferential advantages which not merely give them an advantage over us but negative the preference which they themselves have given us&#x2014;and that if our hands had been equally untied we might have obtained, not by a tariff war, but: by ordinary negotiations, advantages from which we have been barred by what seems to us the retrograde policy of His Majesty's Government. We also may hope to know, but we do not yet
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0185"/>
<col>319</col>
know, the extent to which Canada may be willing to show the sympathy which she has always felt with British trade by any readjustment of her existing tariff with this country consequent on this Agreement. Those things remain for us to see. I hope that none of the results which my noble friend anticipates may follow this Agreement.<lb/>
Mr. Balfour has spoken of this as an Imperial disaster. He carefully weighed his language, and directed it solely to the commercial standpoint. We on this Bench associate ourselves with that language. We associate ourselves with the view that it is undesirable that the whole economic and commercial relations of Canada should be guided merely by the Dominion's proximity to the United States. I believe that this country had, and will have, it in its power to continue the policy which has gone so far to make Canada prosperous; and, without in any way criticising the action of Canadian Statesmen, we still hope that the door will not be closed to negotiations which we believe will be profitable to both peoples.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00868"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTH1LL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Lord. President expressed mild surprise that I should have spoken with some heat, and he affected to misunderstand the cause of my annoyance. I must therefore explain it once more. I spoke with some warmth because the Government have for so long withheld information which they might have given, and have been so exceedingly discourteous in regard to the desire of the Colonies for Imperial Preference. That, I think, was sufficient justification for speaking rather more forcibly than I should otherwise have done, or than I might have done had I known that the noble Viscount was going to promise us all the Papers. I wished to emphasise the urgency of this demand for information which has been withheld so long.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, in spite of the words with which I opened my remarks when 1 asked that I might be considered as safeguarding myself against possible misunderstandings and misrepresentations, misrepresented me in precisely the way in which I anticipated he would. He charged me with impugning the right of Canada to make any Treaty or Agreement she chooses. I distinctly stated that she had the right, as much as we have the right, to make any Agreement or Treaty she
<col>320</col>
pleases, and that nothing was further from my mind than to make any complaint of the action of Canadian Ministers, of whom you will remember, I spoke in terms of warm admiration. The noble Viscount further represented me as suggesting that during the General Election His Majesty's Government ought to have asked the constituencies whether they approved the policy of the Colony. There could not be a grosser misrepresentation of my remarks. What I suggested was that His Majesty's Government, knowing that these arrangements were going on, might well have said to the people of this country during the election, "If you adhere to your present policy of refusing mutual preference, business will go elsewhere. Do you still wish to adhere to your refusal?" But there was no suggestion whatever of asking them whether or not they approved of the policy of a Colony. Then, again, the noble Viscount devoted most of his speech to citing instances in which British Ambassadors and diplomatists have negotiated on behalf of the Dominions. Of course, they have done so; who has ever suggested that they should not I have never heard that suggestion, and I cannot understand what the noble Viscount had in mind when he imagined that there had been any suggestion that it was not Mr. Bruce's business to do his best for Canada in her negotiations. Of course, it was his business. Every British diplomatist is a diplomatist for the interests of every part of the Empire as well I as for those of the British Empire as a whole. Since the noble Viscount has promised the Papers for which I asked, I can only express my satisfaction that we are at last to have information, the absence of which has caused us very real anxiety.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0007P0I0186"/>
<col>321</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00874">The noble Duke said: These questions arise from a debate which took place a fortnight ago in your Lordships' House. In the course of that debate I made the statement that in the event of mobilisation there would be a shortage of Regular infantry officers. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War did not accept that statement as accurate. My first question is as to the total number of Regular infantry officers required for the Expeditionary Force. For this Force there are seventy-five battalions of Infantry. In each battalion there are twenty-eight officers, so that the total number of Regular infantry officers (including Guards) required for the seventy-five battalions by the War Establishments, 1910&#x2013;1911, is 2,100. With regard to the Mounted Infantry, according to the statement of the Secretary of State for War on June 27 last the strength of the Mounted Infantry is as follows. There are two mounted Brigades and two companies of Mounted Infantry to act as divisional Cavalry for each of the six Divisions. The two mounted Brigades are composed of four battalions, and each battalion wants twenty-five officers, so that the four altogether require 100. The twelve companies will each require six officers, or a total of seventy-two. The total, therefore, of Regular Infantry officers required in the Expeditionary Force for Mounted Infantry duties is 172. Thus the total required of Regular officers for the Expeditionary Force is 2,272. Then I next ask the noble Lord the number of Regular Infantry officers who are at present serving at home in the eighty-two battalions and who are by the Amy List of January, 1911, not seconded. I make that number myself, by counting them up in the Army List" to be 1,940. I ask also the number of Infantry officers required for the seven battalions remaining at home on the departure of the Expeditionary Force. There are seven battalions, which gives a total of 196. The result of those figures is this. The deficiency for the Expeditionary Force is 332 officers, leaving out, the 196 required for the seven home battalions. The total deficiency is 528.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00875"><sup>*</sup><member>TEE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the noble Duke's first question, I may say that we find the number required is 2,461, exclusive of those required for Staff appointments. To the second question the reply is that on January 1 last the
<col>322</col>
number was 1,998. The answer to the third question is that four battalions, not seven, will remain at home, and the number of officers required for these is 112. With regard to the other remark, the noble Duke must take into consideration that not only the Special Reserve but also the Reserve of officers are available. The Paper laid on the Table of this House in May, 1909, showed that the total number of Infantry officers available for service abroad was 5,210 in January, 1909, and the number available now is slightly in excess of that.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE DECLARATION OF LONDON.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00904"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the Lord President of the Council whether he will lay on the Table of the House Papers showing the view of the Board of Admiralty on the effect which the establishment of an International Prize Court of Appeal and the Declaration of London would have on the conduct of a naval war by this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00905"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in reply to the noble Earl, I have to say that the opinions expressed by the Admiralty on this subject are not in a form in which their publication would be in the public interest. It would not be desirable&#x2014;I think the noble Earl will agree with me&#x2014;to make public any views as to the effect of the provisions of the Declaration of London on the conduct of naval operations. To do that would be equivalent to informing a. possible enemy of the manner in which the Admiralty might intend to use the powers of blockade or other means of attacking an enemy's commerce. In general terms I play say that the opinion of the Admiralty is that, in existing circumstances, the effect of the establishment of an International Court of Appeal and of the Declaration of London on this country as a belligerent in the conduct of naval operations would be small and inconsiderable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00906"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member> rose to call attention to the Declaration of London, and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to call your Lordships' attention to a matter of the most vital importance to this country&#x2014;namely, the new rules of naval warfare which have been drawn up under the Declaration of London. They affect us primarily as the dwellers in these Islands in a particular manner, but they affect the whole of our Dominions beyond the seas in a manner almost as vital. The Declaration of London has been considered, and adversely reported upon, by a large number of Chambers of Commerce, approaching thirty in number, and ten Shipping Associations, including the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom, which is the representative Chamber of the Kingdom, besides Shipping Assurance and other bodies. The Colonies have vehemently protested their right to be heard, and Australasia has the
<col>326</col>
question down to be debated at the Colonial Conference. There is a widespread feeling of alarm in business, commercial, and shipping centres; but the replies where they have been given to the representatives of these bodies by the Foreign Office have been on the whole to the effect that those who made them did not understand the present state of the Law of Nations on the subject or what alterations the Declaration made in it. Well, my Lords, this must be due to some inherent vice in Chambers of Commerce and other such bodies, because not only have they tried their best to understand them, but in many instances have called into their counsels men of acknowledged repute in matters of International Law before they made their protests. I sincerely hope that they may now be enlightened on the many points which trouble them. It is a matter which the trader, the commercial man, the shipowner, the underwriter must clearly understand as it affects him so closely.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00907">The Declaration of London is the direct outcome of the second Peace Conference, which met at the Hague on June 15, 1907, when forty-five States were represented by 156 delegates. At this Conference fourteen documents were passed, of which Great Britain has signed thirteen and ratified nine. The one not signed was the Convention setting up the International Prize Court. The Resolution proposing the establishment of this International Prize Court was moved by Baron Marschall von Bieberstein on behalf of the German Government, and its object was to create an international Jurisdiction to discuss the legality of captures in maritime war. This would be a High Court of Justice sitting as a Court of Appeal, while National Tribunals would deliberate in the first instance. This new Court of Appeal would practically supersede the British Prize Courts, which have always held such a high place in the estimation of nations for their independence, integrity, and justice, as, indeed, may be said for the other great maritime nations. It is to consist of fifteen Judges, nine to form a quorum: the Judges appointed by Germany, the United States of America, Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and Russia are always to be summoned, and Judges and Deputy Judges are to be appointed by Argentina, Columbia, Turkey, Paraguay, Bolivia, Roumania,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0189"/>
<col>327</col>
Persia, Panama, Costa Rica, Haiti, Guatemala, Brazil, China, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Nicaragua, Cuba, Honduras, Ecuador, Switzerland, Luxembourg and other maritime countries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00908">Although the Convention set up the Prize Court as mentioned, the rules according to which it was to decide were left very vague. In the Report it says&#x2014;
<quote>"The new International Prize Court is called upon to make the law, and to take into account other principles than those to which are submitted the National Prize Court Jurisdiction, whose decision is attacked before the International Court."</quote>
The new Court was, in fact, to make the law, and the law was to be founded on some new and undefined principles. The Report also says&#x2014;
<quote>"How is nationality, property, or domicile to be proved? Is it only by the ships papers or equally by other document produced? We intend to leave the Court full power of appreciation."</quote>
And again&#x2014;
<quote>"Every liberty is to be left to the Court as to the appreciation of the various elements furnished to it to determine the conclusion. There is not here a legal system of proofs."</quote>
It was felt, however, on further consideration that a Court of this character could hardly be set up over the National Prize Courts of the various countries without some much more definite rules to guide them, and so, on February 27, 1908, a circular-letter was addressed to His Majesty's representatives at Berlin, Madrid, Paris. Rome, St. Petersburg, Tokyo, Vienna, Washington, and subsequently the Hague, proposing that a Conference should be held in London to determine what the new laws for the International Prize Court should be; and this Conference resulted in the Declaration of London which we are now considering.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00909">I am far from wishing to decry or run down any attempts to settle international disputes by arbitration, or even to establish such Courts as an International Prize Court, but the Court must be competent and the rules should be fair. It must also be remembered that the International Prize Court and its rules are not in any sense designed for preventing war and all its horrors, as they only come into effect after war has unfortunately broken out, and practically form the rules and regulations under which that war is to be conducted. It is from this point of
<col>328</col>
view that I propose shortly to consider the provisions of the Declaration of London, and to formulate certain questions which I trust will be met in a manner calculated to remove the apprehension which undoubtedly exists. The importance of the whole subject as regards this country, dependent as it is on the sea for its food and its commerce, cannot be exaggerated. It concerns not only these islands but all our Dominions beyond the seas. The provisions of this Declaration affect our national and Imperial existence in the most vital manner. I believe it is the most important question before the country at the present time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00910">Now, my Lords, to proceed to the Declaration of London, which appears to me to be more important than the International Prize Court, important as that is. The International Prize Court does not come into operation till after the National' Prize Courts have adjudicated, and then only affects the individual who claims that his property has been wrongfully seized or destroyed. The harm to the nation will have been done; the individual owner of the ship and cargo may eventually receive compensation, but it is a question even then whether it will be worth his while to claim it. He will be appealing against the decision of a National Prize Court; at the International Prize Court he will be fighting a nation. He will have to engage counsel in a language to he determined by that International Prize Court; he will have to face a very large expenditure, perhaps even the expenses of a Commission of Inquiry; he can only, if successful, get the bare value of what he has lost, and from this various deductions are apparently to be made. It is doubtful whet her this appeal will be worth his while; it probably will not unless enormous sums are at stake.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00911">But, as it appears to me this is not the important question. The important question is the establishment of these new rules contained in this document, the Declaration of London, which embody the new conditions of naval warfare. These do matter, and they matter most of all to us, because we depend on sea commerce for our national existence. There are certain points on which I hope we shall get definite information from His Majesty's Government&#x2014;as the commercial and mercantile community is in great doubt about them, and these
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0190"/>
<col>329</col>
doubts have not yet been removed&#x2014;before we come to the Declaration itself. The first of these is whether the Declaration is considered to be binding on the signatory Powers whether the International Prize Court is set up or not. The preliminary provision of the Declaration states&#x2014;
<quote>"The signatory Powers are agreed that the rules contained in the following chapters correspond in substance with the generally recognised principles of International Law."</quote>
That is a very definite statement to be committed to, and it is further enforced by Article 66, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"The signatory Powers undertake to insure the mutual observance of the rules contained in the present Declaration in any war in which all the belligerents are parties thereto. They will, therefore, issue the necessary instructions to their authorities and to their armed forces, and will take such measures as may be required in order to insure that it will be applied by their Courts, and more particularly by their Prize Courts."</quote>
The meaning of this seems pretty plain&#x2014;namely, that if this Declaration is ratified we in these Islands, and our Colonies who have not as yet been consulted, are definitely committed to all the provisions of the Declaration, which it is stated are to be taken as a whole. I know that great authorities take a different view. For instance, Mr. Gibson Bowles, one of the few people in this country who have mastered the 2,000 pages of the French Blue Book relating to this matter, takes the view that the establishment of the Prize Court is the King Pin of the situation, and that if the Prize Court is not set up the Declaration falls to the ground. I hope that His Majesty's Government will make this point quite clear.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00912">There is another question I should like to ask before briefly discussing a few points of the Declaration, and it is one on which there has been a good deal of controversy among international lawyers in the public Press. It is this: Is the Report of Mr. Renault, which is a running commentary on each Article of the Declaration, to be taken as authoritative? From some points of view it seems to make the Declaration better; from other points of view it seems to make it worse; while yet, again, from others it seems difficult to reconcile it with the Declaration at all. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"The International Prize Court, if set up, will be bound to construe the text in conformity with the terms of the Report."</quote>
<col>330</col>
Sir Thomas Barclay, at the Summer Conference of the International Law Association, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have never heard of any such suggestion being made by a practical lawyer";</quote>
and Professor Holland has stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"Such a Report as that which accompanies the Declaration of London has no claim to the sort of interpretative authority which has been attributed to it, nor is it desirable that the requisite steps should be taken to give it that authority. It would be calamitous should a practice be introduced of attempting to cure the imperfect expression of a Treaty by tacking on to it an equally authoritative reasoned commentary."</quote>
And he goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The fact is that the vitally important questions of theory and practice raised by the Convention and Declaration need calmer and better instructed discussion than they have yet received. Ought they not to be referred to a Royal Commission, on which should be placed representatives of the Navy arid merchant service, of the corn trade, and of the Colonies, together with international lawyers, in touch with the views of their Continental colleagues?"</quote>
Be that as it may, it is absolutely impossible to gauge the effects of this new Declaration unless one knows whether the Report in the shape of a running commentary by M. Renault is authoritative or not; and, if it is authoritative, perhaps the suggestion of Professor Westlake, Mr. Cohen, and others, that it should be ratified by all the Powers concerned, should be carried out. A categorical answer from the Government on this point appears to be absolutely necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00913">As regards the Declaration itself, I propose to confine my remarks to three main points raised by the various Chambers of Commerce in their protests to the Foreign Office. These protests have been answered at some length by the Foreign Office, which has taken up the view that the Chambers did not understand international law or the Law of Nations as now very generally interpreted, and also that they had misconceived the alterations introduced into that generally accepted law by this new Code. That, of course, may be so, and I only hope that this discussion may do something to clear away these misconceptions. In these Islands we cannot afford to have misconceptions on sea, laws which affect our national existence. The merchants, traders, shipowners, corndealers, and underwriters, nay even the people at large, must understand. These matters affect the business man;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0191"/>
<col>331</col>
they are not religious mysteries, or murmured incantations of priests behind a veil. The Declaration, when ratified, is to hold good for twelve years; none of the signatory Powers can denounce it within that time. I am no enemy of International Agreements, of Arbitration Courts, or of proposals for limiting armaments, and I am as alive to the horrors of war as any member of this Chamber; but International Agreements should be fair and not one-sided, otherwise they may provoke the very war which all the friends of peace wish to avoid. This Declaration and the International Prize Court have nothing to do with peace; they only take effect when war has actually broken out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00914">My Lords, the Declaration of London is divided into nine chapters, and concludes with some final provisions; there are seventy-one Articles altogether. The chapters dealing with blockade in time of war, with unneutral service, with the transfer of the neutral flag, enemy character, convoy, resistance to search, and compensation, I propose to leave to others who are more capable of pointing out where they are injurious, if they are injurious, to the interests of this country. I shall confine my criticisms to three main points&#x2014;first, the effect of the Declaration in exposing to capture or deliberate destruction of food supplies borne to this country in time of war in neutral vessels; secondly, the admission of the principle of destruction of neutral prizes; and, thirdly, the absence of any provision in the Declaration for preventing the conversion of merchant vessels into commerce destroyers on the high seas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00915">As regards the first point, the question of food supplies, it should be observed that there are three divisions of articles made by the Declaration. The first is absolute contraband, the second conditional contraband, and the third the free list. Articles exclusively used for war are absolute contraband. The free list contains articles which may not be declared contraband of war, and which, with the notable exception of cotton and hemp, never have been declared contraband of war. But what concerns us most is the list of articles susceptible of use in war as well as for purposes of peace, which may, without notice, be treated as contraband of war under the name of "conditional contra-
<col>332</col>
band." The list of conditional contraband is given in Article 24 of the Declaration, and is as follows&#x2014;(1) foodstuffs; (2) forage and grain suitable for feeding animals; (3) clothing, fabrics for clothing, and boots and shoes suitable for use in war; (4) gold and silver in coin or bullion and paper money; (5) vehicles of all kinds available for use in war, and their component parts; (6) vessels, craft and boats of all kinds, floating docks, parts of docks and their component parts; (7) railway material both fixed and rolling stock, and material for telegraphs, wireless telegraphs, and telephones;(8) balloons and flying machines, and their distinctive component parts, together with accessories and articles recognisable as intended for use in connection with balloons and flying machines; (9) fuel, lubricants; (10) powder and explosives not specially prepared for use in war; (11) barbed wire and implements for fixing and cutting the same; (12) horseshoes and shoeing materials; (13) harness and saddlery; (14) field glasses, telescopes, chronometers, and all kinds of nautical instruments. This list can, under Article 25, be added to by a declaration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00916">My Lords, this list is a comprehensive one, but I suppose the first article&#x2014;foodstuffs&#x2014;is to us living in Islands which import food at the appalling rate of &#x00A3;484 a minute is the most important, and we must see what the Declaration has to say on the subject of the importation of conditional contraband. Under Article 34 of the Declaration neutral ships are liable to, capture, and under certain circumstances, to destruction if the goods are consigned to enemy authorities, or to a contractor established in the enemy country, who as a matter of common knowledge supplies articles of this kind to the enemy. A similar presumption arises if the goods are consigned to a fortified place belonging to the enemy, or other place "serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy." This Article sets forth where neutral ships may not convey conditional contraband to. It is the most disputed Article in the Declaration as regards its precise meaning. "Enemy authorities," "contractor," "place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy," require the most careful definition. It has been frequently pointed out that "contractor" is a very limited translation of the authentic word, which is <i>commercant</i>, or trader, and I
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0192"/>
<col>333</col>
suppose there are few great traders in this country who are absolutely free from the imputation of supplying the authorities with articles of conditional contraband. "Enemy" is also ambiguous in this Article. But the sentence which has caused the most, alarm is "other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy." These Islands are small, and there is no port suitable for the reception of grain ships which could not serve as a base for our armed forces, or winch, as a matter of fact, does not do so. The commentary, or report, of M. Renault, whether authoritative or not, seems to make the matter worse. He says it may be a fortified place belonging to the enemy, or a place used as a base whether of operations "or of supply," for the armed forces of the enemy. This seems to adopt the German view, for Articles 34, 35, and 49 are taken almost in their entirety from the German report laid before the London Conference.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00917">The Chambers of Commerce and others representing the trading and shipping interests of this country are much alarmed by these Articles. It appears to them that foodstuffs and other articles of conditional contraband would, when shipped to any port in the United Kingdom, be liable to capture, and under Article 49 the neutral vessels carrying them would be liable to be sunk. They would be grateful if the Government would name any ports in this country which they consider at the present time as above suspicion&#x2014;any ports to which, if this country were at war, neutral vessels could convey foodstuffs and the other articles of conditional contraband. The Chamber of Commerce of Glasgow asked tile Foreign Office whether Glasgow would be considered a free port, but the answer, put shortly, was that the question would have to be decided by the International Prize Court sitting at the Hague probably long after the war was over. The same uncertainty would also exist when this country was a neutral. I am not sure indeed, that under Article 34 it would not be the duty of a hostile commander to capture any neutral vessels conveying conditional contraband to any port in this country. The best and safest manner to wage warfare on this country is to cut off her supplies, especially of food, and the sinking of neutral vessels carrying foodstuffs to this country would inevitably cause a serious rise in prices of food and freight and probably create a panic. And,
<col>334</col>
indeed, he would run no great risks in comparison with the objects to be secured. The owner of the cargo and ship would have the <i>onus</i> put upon him of proving before the International Prize Court that the port for which he was destined could not serve as a basis of supply for the armed forces of the enemy, and a negative is very difficult to prove.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00918">I am well aware that the supporters of the Declaration argue, with regard to foodstuffs, that this country would be no worse off under the Declaration than it is as matters stand now. They maintain that food can be declared contraband at the present time. But that is not so. As the Right Hon. James Bryce stated in the House of Commons on August 11, 1904&#x2014;
<quote>"Food, by the general consent of nations, was not contraband of war, unless it is clearly proved to be intended for military or naval purposes. In 1885 a demand was made by the French Government to treat rice as contraband of war. Lord Granville protested in a most, energetic way, and stated that he would not recognise the decision of French Prize Courts which treated rice under that category, anti in point of fact rice never was treated as contraband of war."</quote>
It may also be noted that, as regards this particular instance, in the French Chamber it was stated that rice was made contraband not as the food of the people, but because it was used as tribute and as payment for the Chinese soldiers. Many more quotations could be given against the thesis that the food of the people can be declared contraband of war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00919">The worst of Article 34 is that while good excuse is given for foodstuffs coming to this country in neutral vessels in time of war being seized and even destroyed, Article 35 states that conditional contraband is not liable to capture when it is to be discharged in an intervening neutral port. That is to say, if we were to be at war with a Continental Power or Powers neutral vessels carrying conditional contraband, which includes all the articles I have already enumerated, could be, as I understand it, addressed straight to their belligerent forces, but we could not interfere with it as long as it was to be discharged at a neutral intervening port. Our cruisers might meet them, but they could only wish them godspeed. These two Articles taken together are grossly unfair to us as an Island Power. We have no neutral ports to draw these supplies from overland. All
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0193"/>
<col>335</col>
our ports would be suspect. It is said, indeed, that neutral vessels could take our food supplies to France if France were a neutral, which is perhaps improbable. But grain comes over now in big ships. There are no facilities for storing and transhipping large quantities of grain in the northern French ports, and Antwerp and Rotterdam, where there are facilities, might not be geographically very safe points for this operation, which in any case must largely increase the cost of the commodity. Articles 34 and 35 imperil our food supplies and other articles of conditional contraband, while they secure them for possible Continental enemies when carried in neutral ships. It is impossible for the captain of a neutral vessel carrying foodstuffs to any port in England to satisfy the commander of a hostile cruiser as to the destination of his cargo. For one thing, he does not know. Under modern conditions cargoes of grain change hands on the high seas, and it is impossible to prove that their destination is what is termed innocent. The hostile commander will in that case either capture or perhaps sink the ship, and leave the talking to be done afterwards at the International Prize Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00920">Now, my Lords, I come to the second point in my criticism, the admission of the principle of destruction of neutral prizes which is contained in Article 49. This is also one of the points submitted by the German representatives and agreed to in the Declaration. Article 48 says&#x2014;
<quote>"A neutral vessel which has been captured may not be destroyed by the captor; she must be taken into such a port as is proper for the determination there of all questions concerning the validity of the capture."</quote>
That is quite right and in accordance with the hitherto accepted Law of Nations, and is fully borne out by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his letter to Sir Edward Fry at the Hague Conference, in which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"As regards the sinking of neutral prizes, which gave rise to so much feeling in this country during the Russo-Japanese War, Great Britain has always maintained that the right to destroy is confined to enemy vessels only, and this view is favoured by other Powers. Concerning the right to destroy captured neutral vessels, the view hitherto taken by the greater naval Powers has been that, in the event of it being impossible to bring in a vessel for adjudication, she must be released. You should urge the maintenance of the doctrine upon this subject which British Prize Courts have for at least two hundred years held to be the Law."</quote>
<col>336</col>
But all that goes by the board in the next Article, No. 49, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"As an exception a neutral vessel which has been captured by a belligerent warship, and which would be liable to condemnation, may be y destroyed if the observance of Article 48 Would involve danger to the safety of the warship or to the success of the operations in which she is engaged at the time."</quote>
Thus Article 48 says you may not sink neutral vessels, while Article 49 says you may if you like. The commander of the warship is the judge on the spot as to whether the neutral vessel is carrying contraband, and the operations in which he is engaged is commerce destroying, and he would not be doing his duty to his country if lie allowed anything to interfere with the success of these operations, and so he is bound to take full advantage of Article 49. The Declaration allows this innovation on the practice of 200 years; the signatory Powers cannot protest; the only appeal is to the International Prize Court which I have already alluded to. Before the Declaration the neutral Power would have protested energetically if her ships had been sunk, but now she must wait for the individuals who have suffered to prove a negative in an undetermined language in the International Prize Court. If we were at war and the United States were neutral much of our grain from North America would come here in United States ships. Under Articles 34 and 49 these ships may be sunk, and I do not see how the United States, if she ratifies this Treaty, can protest, and the same remark applies to the other signatory Powers. In this respect, instead of being better off under this Declaration as the Under-Secretary of State avers, we are a great deal worse off than we were before.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00921">The last of the three points to which desire to call attention is the absence of any provision in the Declaration for preventing the conversion of merchant vessels into commerce destroyers on the high seas. This is a most vital consideration as regards this country, which owns fifty per cent. of the sea carrying trade of the world. The first Article of the Treaty of Paris of 1856 is: "Privateering is and remains abolished"; but attempts are being made to revive it in a worse form than has ever been experienced. The matter cannot be put plainer than it is by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ill his instructions to our representative. On the eve of the Conference he wrote&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0194"/>
<col>337</col>
<quote>"Apart from the important question of principle involved, there are two practical considerations which have chiefly weighed with His Majesty's Government in refusing to recognise the right to convert merchant vessels into ships of war on the high seas. One is the facility which such a right would give to the captain of a merchant vessel qualified to act as a war-ship, to seize enemy or neutral ships without wanting. The other is that enemy vessels under the mercantile flag, but suitable fur conversion, would be able, as merchantmen, to claim and obtain in neutral ports all the hospitality and privileges which would, under the accepted rules of naval warfare, be denied to them if they were warships. Availing herself of these advantages, such a vessel, found in distant waters after the outbreak of hostilities, would be enabled to pass from one neutral port to another until she reached the particular point in her voyage Where she might most conveniently be converted into a commerce destroyer."</quote>
Surely this is a very grave omission in the new Code of sea warfare. The matter has been left undetermined. Germany, France, and Russia were in favour of conversion on the high seas, and the United States, Great Britain, Japan, Italy, Austria, Holland, and Spain decided against it. Is the International Prize Court to decide for or against In the Russo-Japanese war this country protested against the Russian Volunteer Fleet coming as unarmed ships through the Dardanelles and acting as commerce destroyers, and Lord Lansdowne's protest was at that time upheld. Although we own, roughly speaking, one-half of the sea trade of the world our ocean highways are very inadequately policed. I believe that from Vancouver to Cape Horn we have no cruisers capable of defending it if attacked by swift converted liners. Our twenty-seven cruisers free for that purpose are quite inadequate in the other parts of the world, and we should want an enormous addition to our commerce protectors if this right of conversion on the high seas is to be permitted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00922">My Lords, I have tried, very briefly, to point out the reasons why, in the opinion as expressed by large sections of our business community, the Declaration of London should not be ratified. Although I am most strongly in favour of International Agreements which have as their end the settlement of disputes by arbitration and not by war, yet I believe that this Declaration is so grossly unfair that it will rather invite war against this country than prevent it. By the conversion at sea of peaceful vessels into commerce destroyers without notice on the high seas, by the sanction of the destruction of
<col>338</col>
neutral prizes, and by Articles 33 and 34 which imperil our food supplies in neutral ships, we are exposing ourselves to new and most grave dangers. The Declaration of London constitutes the greatest peril to us as an Island Power, and I trust it will never come into operation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00923">I should like to press for an answer to the three questions I have put. Is the Declaration binding, if signed, on the signatory Powers, supposing the International Prize Court is not set up? Is the commentary of M. Renault to be considered as an authoritative interpretation of the Declaration? And will the Government name the ports in this country to which neutral vessels carrying foodstuffs and other conditional contraband would have free access? In conclusion, I may say that on the whole the concluding paragraph of the Declaration is the one with which I am in most accord&#x2014;namely, "Done at London," for that is where we have been done, and on February 26, 1909.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00924">My noble friend Lord Lamington, who has a Motion on the Paper to refer this matter to a Royal Commission, is unfortunately prevented by indisposition from being in his place, and therefore on his behalf, if it is consonant with the rules of the House, I should like to move the Motion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00925">Moved to resolve, That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that a Royal Commission be appointed to report on the advisability of this country agreeing to the terms of the Declaration of London.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Desborough.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00926"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I am entitled to ask this evening for a special measure of that indulgence which your Lordships always so generously and freely accord to a member of this House who addresses you for the first time, because in my first essay in political and Parliamentary speech I have to deal with a question of great complexity and difficulty, and one which has been the subject of much criticism. In putting before your Lordships my views, which I feel strongly and honestly, I wish to say that I do not speak in any sense for the Government. The noble Lord who has just sat down will, I am sure, not think me discourteous if I do not immediately touch on the particular questions he has
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0195"/>
<col>339</col>
raised, though I shall have to deal with them later in a different order from that in which he has placed them before the House.<lb/>
My position is not quite an ordinary one. I am interested more than most people in this Declaration, because I had the honour, under the instructions and authority of His Majesty's Government, of presiding as British Plenipotentiary at the Conference of London which drew up the Articles of the Declaration, and at the conclusion of the discussions I had the satisfaction of knowing that the result was approved by His Majesty's Government. I have been told, though I do not think it matters much, that personal attacks have been made on the actual delegates. I am quite sure the noble Lords on both Front Benches will agree that I need not concern myself with these attacks, because it is well established that when a public servant is employed to act by his political superiors blame or approval for him is to come from them and the responsibility is theirs if they adopt his conclusions and act upon them. I only say that because of my colleagues who worked loyally with me in pursuance of the instructions they received, and who, I think, ought not to be subject to comment of that character.<lb/>
I myself have carefully abstained from taking any part in the discussions that have raged round this document and round the conditions under which the International Prize Court was proposed to be established. I have carefully abstained from newspaper correspondence and from attending gatherings to which I have been invited at which the subject was discussed, but I hope I am not doing anything wrong in addressing your Lordships to-night. I am no longer an official, and with the knowledge I necessarily have of how the conclusions were reached I think it is almost a duty to afford such explanations as I can make, by going through the Declaration, avoiding as far as possible a controversial tone, and merely commenting on what seems to me to be the effect of the various provisions embodied in the Declaration. The difficulty I have found in considering what I should say to-night lies in the great mass of the material, and in the consciousness that the subject cannot be familiar to more than a small number of your
<col>340</col>
Lordships, and, indeed, the knowledge of it is not easily to be acquired.<lb/>
We who have been engaged ill this task, not merely at the time of the Declaration but long before it, have endeavoured to consider the conditions under which naval warfare would now be waged, how they would operate to the advantage or disadvantage of this country, and, lawyers though some of us were, to try and draw practical conclusions as to the results both of the existing condition of things and of the provisions that will be found in the Declaration. I had the advantage of being assisted in those labours by the then Director of Naval Intelligence, Rear-Admiral Slade, now Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies. and by the Secretary to the Imperial Council of Defence, both naval officers of large experience who had studied this subject for many years, and to whom I can never sufficiently express my indebtedness. My colleagues of the Foreign Office were also familiar with the conditions, and they afforded me equally valuable assistance. We took instructions from time to time on points that arose, and we had, I believe, in all the more difficult and crucial questions the direct authority of the representatives of the Government in the course we adopted at those moments.<lb/>
The outcome was this Declaration; and I would like, before I embark upon it, to say a few words about the light in which I think it ought to be considered. You cannot, it seems to me, take the Declaration standing by itself and say, "That is good; that is bad; and as there is something bad in it we won't have it." What you have to do is to try to see how the existing conditions really work out in practice, to see what they really are, to see how far the rules&#x2014;and it is not very far that rules exist at all on many points&#x2014;would operate in time of war ill regard to the interests of this country, whether as belligerents or neutrals, and, finally, how the Declaration itself would work out by comparison. That is, I think, the only standpoint you can take in order to judge whether, first, the thing is in itself an advance in international law, and, most important of all, whether it does injure our country as belligerent or neutral. There can be no question that, whatever advantage it might be in some cases to us as neutrals as regards our trade, if in
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0196"/>
<col>341</col>
order to gain that advantage we had to make any sacrifice of any practicable belligerent right we now possess and can exercise, the neutral interest must go. There in no doubt, I think, about that.<lb/>
When I suggest that the provisions of the Declaration must he compared with the existing state of things I do not think that we can reasonably go back to the great wars of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, because the conditions not only of trade but in all ways are totally different owing to the Declaration of Paris. Whether that Declaration was wisely adopted by this country or not is a matter on which different people may have different opinions. Mr. Bowles, to whom the noble Lord referred, has strong views on that matter. I do not agree with him on many things, but on that point I very largely agree with him. I do not, however, see how it is possible to contemplate that we could go back upon it. Practically every nation in the world of any importance has accepted it. I know that the United States is said to be an exception; but it is not really an exception at all. The reason it was not accepted by the United States at the time was because of their objection to privateering being forbidden. They had no objection to the other rules; and since that time, being no longer dependent on their mercantile population and their mercantile ships to act for them in time of war, they have adopted it in their recent war with Spain. It is impossible to suppose that any Plenipotentiary of the United States could have signed and agreed to the document under consideration without accepting the Declaration of Paris.<lb/>
This question has called forth a great deal of attention in the newspapers, and some writers seem to think that we have given up our right to capture the enemy's ships. That is not so. The right to capture the enemy's ships has not been touched by anything, and it is one of our most valuable weapons of war, because so long as we have the command of the sea we can practically after a short time exclude the enemy's merchant flag from the sea altogether. It is a weapon of great pressure on some countries, and it an important factor for us in a naval war. I am not quite sure how you could have avoided the criticisms that have b en made by the noble Lord of the constitution of the Court. It is better to
<col>342</col>
have an appeal from an enemy's Prize Court than to depend on diplomatic representation when you have been wronged. It must be of advantage to a neutral to go to a Court which is more impartial than the belligerents' Prize Court, the only alternative.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to the independence of Prize Courts. That is quite true about our Prize Courts and those of the United States, but it is not really true of foreign Prize Courts. A great number of them act, quite properly under their system, according to rules laid down by the Executive very often at the beginning of the war for that war. Therefore in a sense you might be at a disadvantage as a belligerent, because, supposing in many instances our rules were more lenient to a neutral than rules laid down by an enemy, we should in some cases release prizes that we had taken, whereas the enemy's Court would condemn prizes they had taken in precisely the same circumstances. Therefore this is, at any rate, a more impartial tribunal than you would get in the enemy's Prize Court. As to the constitution there is always a majority of the great Powers, and I do not accept the idea, if we do succeed in establishing rules that ought to be administered by an International Court, that those rules would, in the face of all Europe, be misapplied. It would be a great responsibility. It is, of course, a matter of opinion, but I do not think those laws would be misapplied. If they were, I think the feelings of neutrals would be very strong, and I cannot help thinking that, as the majority of the judges would be representatives of neutral nations, there really is not much peril of their going wrong in that direction. As probably those of your Lordships who have read the International Prize Court Convention are aware, the cases subject to appeal are very limited.<lb/>
When the Convention was agreed to by the representatives of the Powers at The Hague and transmitted here it was felt that it was impossible that it should be ratified by this country until some rules were made which it should administer. It was left incomplete in the Convention through the absolute impossibility of going any further in the time at the disposal of the representatives. As it stood they were to apply rules of international law, and,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0197"/>
<col>343</col>
where they failed, the principles of justice and equity; but, left thus vague, it was not a tribunal we could possibly approach. The result was that Sir E. Grey invited the Great European Powers. the United States, and Japan to a Conference, taking certain specific points which they had to discuss, with a view, if possible, of framing rules for the guidance of the Court. The Conference met and formulated the Declaration of London, annexing to it an explanatory report, which has been the subject of a good deal of comment by my noble friend. I think it is important to know whether it is an authoritative document which will guide Prize Courts in their decisions. It is not altogether a question of law; to a large extent it is a question of fact; and when we stated in our report that we thought it was a document that would be so treated by the International Prize Courts on the Continent we thought that we were speaking in accordance with fact. I still think so.<lb/>
Naturally I have been impressed by the correspondence I have read in the newspapers between Professor Holland and Professor Westlake, who take different views on the subject. They are men of the greatest eminence, and men to whose views I should defer if I could. But it has struck me that all the letters in the newspapers were rather based on what I would call the English reasoning, the view taken in English Courts of documents that might purport to be explanatory but were not parts of the actual documents under consideration. What is important is not what are the views our Courts would adopt of it but what view other Prize Courts would take of it, and the majority of those would be Continental Courts, and, generally speaking, would adopt the Continental system, which I think Japan also adopts. I ventured, in these circumstances, to communicate with a friend of mine&#x2014;I am not, unfortunately, at liberty to mention his name, but he holds a very high position among International lawyers and is a gentleman whose name would carry weight&#x2014;and I asked hint to let me know what his opinion was on the subject. I will read to your Lordships a translation&#x2014;he is a French lawyer&#x2014;of what he wrote to me&#x2014;
<quote>"In my opinion there is no doubt that the Report which accompanies the Declaration of London will be considered by Continental Prize Courts as the official commentary of the Declaration
<col>344</col>
itself. The circumstances in which the Report was presented show that it must (ought to) be so. Not only was the Report unanimously agreed by the drafting Committee on which all the signatory Powers were represented, but it was also submitted to the Conference itself in full session and by it formally accepted. The signatories have adopted the Articles of the Declaration as interpreted by the Report and with the meaning given them thereby. It constitutes a whole, the parts of which cannot be separated without a breach of the agreement which was attached. As is expressly stated, the Report was not made to satisfy the friendly curiosity of international lawyers but to serve as a guide for the administrative, military, and judicial authorities who might have to apply its provisions. I do not see how that which was in the minds of all could have been more clearly expressed. There is nothing in common between such a Report, the work of the whole Conference, and the preliminary explanations (or preamble) which might precede an ordinary law, to which the Courts might give the force which they thought right. I do not wish to touch on delicate ground, but it seems to me that it was not a case of endeavouring to provide an interpretation in accordance with the practice of English Courts. It does not relate to an Act of Parliament, but to an International Convention which should be taken in the sense in which it was understood by the signatories; and, as I have explained above, the intention of the signatories to adopt it as an approved commentary is beyond question. It is the strict duty of all the authorities who have to apply the Convention to conform to it."</quote>
That is the opinion of an eminent man, and his view I myself believe represents what would be the ordinary practice of the International Court. I think the Prize Courts on the Continent would treat it almost or quite as having Conventional force.<lb/>
The Powers were, before the meeting of the Conference, invited to submit memoranda or statements of their views on the rules and the questions raised for discussion. They did so, and, while there was a certain unity of principle to be traced running through the various memoranda the divergences in regard to practice, or supposed practice, were very serious indeed. I confess that at that time I had very little hope of any issue coming from our meeting. It still seems to me very advantageous to neutrals that, if it could possibly be attained with equity and justice, they should be able to know as nearly as might be what they could do at the outbreak of war, what they could carry, and what perils they might avoid. From the belligerents' point of view I am disposed to think that rules are also, if they can be reached and if they are proper rules, a great advantage, because if a belligerent acts in accordance with such
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0198"/>
<col>345</col>
rules a neutral whose interests he may affect can have no grievance or reason for threatening war or making war with the belligerent of whose conduct he complains except in extreme cases of abuse of powers. The risk of war has been sometimes incurred through the incautious act of a naval officer. If he can have any clear rules for his guidance as to dealing with neutrals it is to his advantage, because it lessens the risk of increasing the area of war. I regret very much that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is not here to-night, because lie could speak with great force and authority on this point. Our experience during the Russo-Japanese war very strongly illustrates that point. There were cases then in which we certainly thought the action taken by Russia was outside the legitimate and proper exercise of her powers. We remonstrated, in some cases successfully and in others not. But her treatment of neutral ships was extremely instructive as to the position in which we stand now in a naval war, whether as neutrals or belligerents.<lb/>
There is another aspect of the matter which should not be lost sight of in considering this question as a whole, and that is whether, even if we should wish to do so, we could now, as we could at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries, enforce any views which we held against the rest of the world. Your Lordships will remember that at that time outside the belligerents there were not any very strong naval Powers and we had hardly any powerful neutrals to consider, and there were moments during those long wars when we certainly did not consider neutrals. The danger of that was illustrated when we were asserting our belligerent; rights against neutrals to the utmost in 1812. There was one neutral&#x2014;the United States of America&#x2014;which was provoked into a war, one on which we at least can look back with no satisfaction, and which produced distrust which is only now dying and in many parts of the United States of America is not dead. But if there was one neutral then who was of importance to us there are many now; and I do not think, even if we desired it, which I am sure we should not, we could now play the part of <i>Athanasius contra mundum.</i><lb/>
I owe your Lordships an apology for speaking at such length before actually coming to the provisions of the Declaration,
<col>346</col>
but this is a matter which cannot be very well known to all your Lordships and therefore I thought some little preliminary history, if not very valuable, would at least to some extent illustrate what followed. I should like to say that I am in no sense a spokesman for the Government. I do not know what they are going to say. But I am conscientiously and honestly a supporter of the ratification of the Declaration. I believe we shall benefit by it largely as neutrals, and I believe we shall not sacrifice one single belligerent right. In giving my reasons for that view I will confine myself to those points which have been mainly the subject of criticism&#x2014;namely, those dealing with blockade, contraband, the sinking of neutral prizes, and the absence from the Declaration of any provision as to the conversion of merchant ships at sea. At the Hague Conference Sir Edward Fry, a man who does not speak lightly, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The International law of to-day is hardly anything but a chaos of opinions, often contradictory, and decisions of national Courts based on national laws."</quote>
With regard to blockade, I read in one newspaper that we were giving everything away. I am going to suggest to your Lordships that we have given away nothing, but that we have gained something. Nearly all the rules as to blockade are really practically in accordance with our own law. Looking to history, to the limitation of our theoretical rule and its working in practice, as well as to the wide limits which may be included in the "area of operations of the war-ships detailed to render the blockade effective," the result is that Clause 17 in effect means, if not all that might be covered by the old principle, all that it was found in practice could be effectually put in force there under, and in this respect Great Britain has in no sense weakened her effective power of blockade, while she has obtained almost complete acceptance of her principles, and complete abandonment of the French rule of notification and of the Continental theory of definite lines of blockade.<lb/>
It has been said that in accepting the proposal that ships should only be captured for breach of blockade inside the area of operations of the blockading squadron we have made a material and important concession. That I deny. Under our existing rules a ship would not be condemned if
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0199"/>
<col>347</col>
she had an alternative destination and though she might have started for the blockaded port had abandoned the intention of going there. Under modern conditions she would get orders at the last moment by telegraph. She would never commit herself to the intention to break blockade in the earliest stage of her voyage. There are eighty-eight cases in the English books of condemnation; Of these eighty-eight cases there was not one single one in which the ship was not condemned except under conditions in which I contend she would inevitably have been condemned under the provisions of the Declaration. I should qualify that by saying there were four eases, and four only, in which the exact locality of capture was not certain. Therefore, through all these long wars we never condemned a ship for breach of blockade unless she was close to the blockaded port or coast. It seems to me that we have secured under the Declaration exactly what we want. We could not accept the mileage limitation suggested by some of the Powers because the conditions of blockade vary. The only condition of a blockade is that it must be effective, and the only test of the area is whether it makes an effective blockade. The Report is, of course, of great value as illustrating that, but personally I submit that under the Declaration&#x2014;Report or no Report&#x2014;it is quite clear that the area is a perfectly loose term only limited by what is necessary for the effectiveness of the blockade, and a naval officer would not make a larger area than he wanted because he would require more ships. His object would be to blockade with the least force necessary to make it efficient.<lb/>
I do not say much about egress, because I do not think it is a very important point. As a matter of fact, I believe there are only one or two cases of egress in our books at all; but nobody would detach a man-of-war for the purpose of intercepting a neutral ship. if she was not doing anything to injure us. I would make one general observation about blockade which might induce your Lordships to think I need not have dwelt upon these considerations so much. The observation I desire to make is that a ship here or there is not of much importance. In a blockade now, the principal object will be to bring economic pressure to bear on your enemy and prevent ordinary trade going to his own ports, and one or two ships coming
<col>348</col>
in or out would make little difference. That would be an instrument of very large economic pressure indeed, because I am told that land transport is something like ten times as expensive as sea transport and that would bear very hardly on those traders who are mainly accustomed to bring goods in by sea. That view of the matter was illustrated by the Japanese War, in which the fleet captured some junks which were carrying stray cargo and despatches, but there was no importance in those captures.<lb/>
Now I come to the question of Contraband. I will not say it is the most important, but it touches so many matters&#x2014;such as the destruction of neutral property&#x2014;that it becomes really the central feature of the Declaration. The noble Lord, Lord Desborough, quoted, quite properly, a number of commercial associations that feel very apprehensive about the adoption of the Declaration. I should like, if I may, to read a statement made by the chairman of the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association. He states, and I think it probably would be accepted by the noble Lord himself, that&#x2014;
<quote>"Neutral traders feel more and more the want of a definite international Code stating with exactness their rights and liabilities in the presence of naval warfare, and they have suffered more and more from the want of some tribunal more impartial than the Prize Courts of their captors to decide the questions that must arise in every naval war between the neutral traders and the belligerents."</quote>
Before I proceed with contraband, I should like to make a few general observations on the question of food supply. It will be admitted that our food supply is only safe in time of war if we can protect our own ships. if we cannot do that, we shall not be sufficiently supplied by neutrals. I am quite sure it is so. I am told that the neutral ships that would be available could not carry food supplies sufficient to feed us. We must carry our own stuff in our own ships. In one sense the food carried in neutral ships is, I would not say of no importance, but of relatively small importance. What is important is that our own ships should get through. There might be moments when the import of grain or food in neutral ships might be of real importance to us for a time, but I think that the provisions as to contraband and continuous voyage do a great deal to ensure that supply and do nothing whatever to check it. With regard to the fear as to the right to make
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0200"/>
<col>349</col>
additions to the lists of absolute and conditional contraband, I would point out that they are limited, first, as to things capable of use in war, and, secondly, things capable of use for purposes of war or peace. In any case, if a neutral is found with contraband on board and had not received notification, she would be compensated for any destruction of contraband. That is as regards neutrals.<lb/>
With respect to the criticisms that have been made on Articles 33 and 34, I do not think they bear the interpretation that has been put upon them by the noble Lord. Article 33 reads&#x2014;
<quote>"Conditional contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be destined for the use of the armed forces or of a Government Department of the enemy State, unless in this latter case the circumstances show that the goods cannot in fact be used for the purposes of the war in progress."</quote>
I do not think that any real exception can be taken to that Article, because, for reasons that I shall give, I think this class of goods with this destination has always been held to be contraband. I find in the older books the word used is "contraband." The distinction between conditional and absolute contraband had hardly been developed as it is now adopted by our Prize Courts, but, I am afraid, not altogether by other Prize Courts. Article 34 creates certain presumptions as to destination, and sets out certain proofs which may be required. I should like to say about that, that I do not think those presumptions are as perilous as has been suggested. Clearly it cannot be an extension of the principle that the destination must be to a department of the enemy, or the enemy's forces, and, assuming I am right, contraband with that destination would be capable of condemnation. If these goods are sent to a trader&#x2014;I will not use the word "contractor," because there is a doubt about the translation&#x2014;who notoriously supplies the enemy's Government with these goods, that seems to me a reasonable presumption.<lb/>
With regard to the word "base," I would only say that it is to some extent a word of art. We may not know exactly in the first instance, what a naval commander might consider to be a "base" in stopping a ship, or exactly what a Continental Prize Court of Appeal might hold to be a "base." But the Declaration makes no real difference in this respect. We are in exactly the same position at
<col>350</col>
the present time. The naval commander would act in precisely the same way; a belligerent would act in precisely the same way; and the only difference would be that there would be no International Appeal Court to go to if you were dissatisfied with the action of the naval commander. We think, therefore, that those presumptions do not justify all the observations that have been made about them from time to time, and by my noble friend to-night.<lb/>
I should like to touch on what is, perhaps, in one sense the most important matter that has been raised in connection with this question of conditional contraband&#x2014;namely, the application of the doctrine of continuous voyage, or, as I prefer to call it, ultimate destination. Now it has been said, and said very often, that we have obtained the doctrine of continuous voyage as to absolute contraband, but have given away the doctrine of continuous voyage as to conditional contraband. That is not really an accurate statement of our position, because the doctrine of continuous voyage in respect of contraband is really not an English doctrine at all. I do not know whether it would be adopted by our Courts now. I think it very likely would be; but our doctrine of continuous voyage was quite a different one, and it related to the close trade of an enemy during peace being carried on by a neutral during war. If we were at war we stopped such neutral ships as enemy ships and condemned them. This was endeavoured to be met by their entering, between their departure and destination ports, another port front which trade was legitimate. We said we would not recognise that, but that if it was one enterprise it should be treated as a continuous voyage. That was our doctrine of continuous voyage. The United States extended it to contraband during the Civil War, and the most that can be said about that is that we acquiesced. I do not think we protested against the condemnation of one or two of our ships. And this point, as far as we were concerned, came up for consideration in the South African War, when a question arose on a claim that was put forward by us that a voyage was a continuous voyage when the ship was only bound to the neutral port of Lorenzo Marquez. As your. Lordships know, the German Government contested that claim on our part, and for various reasons, partly because there was no contraband on
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0201"/>
<col>351</col>
board, we did not press the claim and it was never brought into the Prize Court. That is how it stands. It is not our doctrine as far as any decision of a Prize Court says it is. I think it might be accepted now as part of our law by our Prize Courts, but that is speculative. I think it would be more accurate to say, if you want it to he legally accurate, that we had obtained the acceptance of continuous voyage for absolute contraband; but, however that may be, let us think what is the value of contraband in continuous voyage. I will come to the consequences afterwards. Conditional contraband is not ear-marked as for any warlike purpose. No one could tell that that was its objective. Do you suppose that if anybody was sending conditional contraband through a neutral port for a belligerent it would be addressed to the belligerent? It would go to a neutral port as ordinary goods, and there would be nothing in the world to indicate to outsiders that it was going to any enemy. It would be consigned to a neutral trader, and no commander of a man-of-war would have any grounds for stopping the ship on its way to a neutral port, because there would be nothing to indicate that there was anything contraband on board.<lb/>
When the question was first under discussion, I confess that was the governing factor in my mind which led me, not to assent, exactly, but rather to advocate assent in order to obtain the acceptance of continuous voyage for absolute contraband. I thought it could not be of the smallest advantage to us. But when I considered the matter afterwards&#x2014;since the Declaration was framed&#x2014;I came to the conclusion that really, on the question of food supply, it is very much to our advantage. Take Germany as an example, and say they took Rotterdam as their port. These goods would be landed at Rotterdam. They would have to go into Germany at a time when. if the coast of Germany was blockaded, the whole volume of her ordinary peaceful trade would be coming by train from neutral ports. The railways would be blocked, the expense and delay would be enormous, and the whole of her trade would come in under great disadvantages. Take our situation. I do not think it is a matter of first-rate importance to us to get our food in neutral bottoms, but assume that it is if we were at war with Germany I must say I cannot imagine that we could not get
<col>352</col>
over the difficulties suggested by carrying the whole of the foodstuffs we wanted in neutral bottoms from French ports. If we had lost command of the Channel and there was time enough to starve us out, I do not think there is much more to be said, or that it much matters, but as long as we command the Channel we can keep going what I might call an omnibus service of ships, carrying all the food neutrals can bring.<lb/>
I should like to deal now with a question that has been hotly debated&#x2014;the question of the destruction of neutral ships. I think some of the letters which I have read in the newspapers and some of the very bitter observations that have been made on the subject arose from the fact that perhaps our representatives at the Hague and we in London somewhat overstated our ease. It is not correct to state that in no circumstances should a neutral ship be destroyed. Our rule is that if a neutral ship is destroyed by us in circumstances of pressure it should be the subject of compensation in all cases. It is not to be an excuse between us and a neutral that the exigencies of war compelled us to destroy the ship, whatever the cause, whatever the character, or whether or not the cargo be contra band. He is to be compensated in all cases. I think I can show you that very easily. I will read an extract from Lord Stowell's decisions. This is in the case of the "Actaeon "&#x2014;
<quote>"Lastly, it has been said that Captain Capel could not spare men from his own ship to carry the captured vessel to a British port, and that he could not suffer her to go into Boston, where she would have furnished important information to the Americans. These are circumstances which may have afforded very good reasons for destroying the vessel and may have made it a very meritorious act in Captain Capel so far as his own Government is concerned, but they furnish no reason why the American owner should be a sufferer &#x2026; I think, therefore, that he is entitled to receive the fullest compensation."</quote>
Again, in another case&#x2014;"Felicity," 2 Dodson, 386:
<quote>"When it is neutral the act of destruction cannot be justified to the neutral owner by the gravest importance of such an act to the public service of the captor's own State. To the neutral it can only be justified under any such circumstances by a full restitution in value."</quote>
And much later Dr. Lushington, in giving judgment in the case of the "Leucade," in 1855 (2 Spinks, 231) says:&#x2014;
<quote>"It is the right of the neutral to be brought in to adjudication&#x2026;No excuse for him (the captor) as to inconvenience or difficulty can be
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0202"/>
<col>353</col>
admitted between captors and claimants &#x2026; If the ship be destroyed for reasons of policy alone, as to maintain a blockade or otherwise, the claimant is entitled to costs and damages."</quote>
I think it is perfectly clear, when you come to think of it, that that must be the rule.<lb/>
Just imagine a case like this. Two fleets within a comparatively short distance of one another are expecting a fleet action. A neutral ship comes up, and is met by one of the belligerent cruisers. We will call it the A fleet, and the ship is on its way to the B fleet, filled, with things that. the B fleet wants for the purposes of this fleet action. Is there any naval officer in the world who would let that ship go? In such circumstances he obviously cannot detach any one to take the ship in. He wants every man and ship for fighting. All he can do is to do the best with the people on board, and if he cannot manage to hold the ship he must sink her. I believe any officer in the world would do so. That is our rule. You do it for the sake of your own side. See how that works out. Other nations have not got our rules as to compensation. The result is that if in the public service we destroy a neutral vessel, we, being the belligerents, pay full compensation for everything. But if we are neutrals and a belligerent finds it necessary to destroy our vessel in the public service, it does not follow that our owners will get any compensation at all. We really get the worst of it both ways.<lb/>
On this point the Russo-Japanese war was extremely instructive. Six ships were sunk altogether, I think. In some cases compensation was paid and in others not, but where the compensation was paid it was paid, not because the ship was sunk&#x2014;that was not the matter before the Prize Court&#x2014;but because the cargo was not contraband and ought not to have been touched at all. I have taken an extract from the translation of the statement made by the Russian Court in the case of the "Knight Commander"&#x2014;
<quote>"The question of the regularity of sinking a vessel according to the exact interpretation of Article 58 of the laws relating to prizes is not one that is subject to the consideration. of Prize Courts &#x2026; Whether the extraordinary circumstances observed by the naval commander in the case and which incited him to sink the vessel were sufficient or not is a matter only for the superior officer &#x2026; and not for the Prize Court &#x2026; The task of Prize Courts is to recognise a prize, i.e., whether the capture is legal or illegal, or, in other words, to confirm the right of capture or to refuse such confirmation."</quote>
<col>354</col>
And they also say, if the State itself thinks fit, may prosecute the captain, but that is not a matter for the Prize Court.<lb/>
Now, what does the arrangement in the Declaration do? It asserts, first, the impropriety of destroying a neutral ship. It then says&#x2014;
<quote>"As an exception, a neutral vessel which has been captured by a belligerent warship and which would he liable to condemnation may be destroyed if the observance of Article 48 would involve danger to the safety of the warship or to the success of the operations in which she is engaged at the time."</quote>
That involves two considerations&#x2014;first, the safety of the warship, and, secondly, that the neutral vessel would be liable to condemnation. Both those provisions are necessary. It is also necessary that the parties on board should be placed in safety, and the ship's papers and other documents which the parties interested consider relevant for the purpose of deciding on the validity of the capture must be taken on board the warship. When you get to the Prize Court you have to establish both those propositions. If you do not establish them you will have to compensate anyhow. You will have to show that there was danger to the safety of the warship, and that the neutral ship was liable to condemnation, and if you establish both pm-positions you are justified. Therefore the <i>onus</i> is very heavy. It is said that it is not sufficient when you have lost your ship to be merely compensated. My only answer to that is that there is nothing else, and it is the same now. There is nothing but compensation when property is destroyed. Whether the complaint is to the Government or to the Prize Court the remedy is compensation, and I know of no other remedy available.<lb/>
Just consider the difficulties. Even assuming, which I do not lightly assume, that any difficulty of man&#x0153;uvring or something of that kind would be held, first by a belligerent Prize Court and then by the international Prize Court to fulfil the conditions required as to danger to the safety of the warship and the success of the operations, before he can free himself from the duty of paying the compensation he has to show that the vessel is liable to condemnation. I do not know how in nine out of ten cases he could possibly do that. He will always have the danger of having to pay compensation on that ground, because the circumstances under which he
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0203"/>
<col>355</col>
would sink a ship would preclude any close examination of the cargo, and, according to the Declaration, there must be on board more than half the cargo contraband; and the ship being sunk, it would be very difficult to establish afterwards what they did destroy. The owners would nearly always get compensation. That is a deterrent. If I could think of a better deterrent I would, but I do not know what other deterrent could be devised. It would have been useless to contend that in no circumstances should a ship be destroyed. Under the rule we have established a ship may only be destroyed in case of necessity, the commander acting in accordance with his obvious duty to his country, and, though not perhaps quite in all cases, practically in almost all cases there would be compensation.<lb/>
I must apologise to your Lordships, but I am afraid I must go back for a minute to a matter connected with food supply, because I do not think I ought to leave that out. It is of considerable importance. The noble Lord said, and it has been said in many other places, that there is no question that food cannot be treated as absolute contraband, but that there is a rule of nations that it should not be. I do not think that the proposition can be put nearly so high as that, and I think the instances that have occurred recently and in other times make it impossible to maintain that view. The French rule that was sent to us with their Memorandum as to the law which they regarded as being the true law of war on that subject was this&#x2014;
<quote>"Food supplies and war material destined to non-combatants are not in principle considered contraband of war, but may be declared so according to the circumstances, of which the Government is judge, and by virtue of an order emanating from it."</quote>
That is, no doubt, in accordance with the view which was strongly urged by France in 1885, when she declared all rice contraband, and to which my noble friend referred in his speech. What happened, according to Mr. Hall in his book on International Law, was that all the French consignments or shipments of rice ceased, and as in a very short time the war came to an end no ship was brought into Court. Mr. Hall puts it very clearly that the shipments absolutely ceased, and consequently trade was seriously interfered with. It is significant to note that the German Govern&#x2014;
<col>356</col>
ment wholly approved of that declaration, and said it was entirely in accordance with the rules of war at that time. Since that time another great Power, Russia, has stated that, in her opinion, in principle, according to the particular war, you may declare food contraband. Russia, it is true, withdrew it from her list at our request, but she made no sacrifice of principle.<lb/>
Nor are we altogether immune. In 1793 we deliberately declared all food supplies going to France contraband, because we desired to bring the pressure of starvation to bear on the French population The truth is that the whole question of contraband has never been very clearly established. I should like to read the observations of Lord Stowell in the case of the "Ranger." He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It must always be remembered that this Government might have availed itself of the interior distress to the enemy's country as an instrument of war. It did not, however, but humanely permitted cargoes of grain to be carried without molestation for the relief of the necessities of famine under which Spain had for some time laboured."</quote>
And further, in another case where there had been pre-emption, the question was the price to be paid. It has nothing to do with the decision in the particular case, but it assumes the right to stop corn that is going to a particular population. In the war between Japan and Russia this question arose, for apparently one ship was captured in July. The Russian Prize Court first condemned the cargo as consigned to a Japanese port. Cargo consigned to private Japanese firms was condemned, because near Kobe there was a military arsenal. Flour on board a ship bound for Korsakovsk, where there were no military operations. Rice and other provisions were bound for a Chinese port in the occupation of Russia, with no evidence of its destination for the forces. The Japanese condemned rice, the food of the population, going to a Chinese port in the occupation of the Russians. There were other cases, but I do not think I need dwell upon them. What it comes to is this, that there really is no generally recognised rule preventing a nation from placing food on its list of absolute contraband. We have a rule, but other nations do not generally recognise it, and we come in on unequal terms. The object which I think has been achieved by the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0204"/>
<col>357</col>
Declaration is that we should come in on equal terms and that all should be in the same position. I think that is all I need say on the subject of the condemnation of food supplies.<lb/>
Now, with regard to conversion. Here we are on rather delicate ground. It is not for a moment to be supposed that anybody would read the speeches that were made at the Conference, but I do not think that any one who read the speech which I had the honour to deliver would feel that I did not realise the importance of this matter. I may perhaps, in my advocacy have put it a little too high. There is no doubt it is a serious matter, because in the first place it contains the element of surprise. A ship in virtue of her mercantile flag might go from port to port and fill up with coal until she got to some point where she hoped. to operate as a warship. The difficulty&#x2014;and I am sure noble Lords will appreciate it&#x2014;in dealing with the matter was that it was quite impossible to say that there was any rule of international law which forbad that. We are trying to make a new rule. I know of nothing which could prevent any nation from turning its ships into anything on the high seas when it is subject to no other jurisdiction, and that right was claimed in the clearest possible terms by the Powers. Qualification was impossible, and we had no alternative but to leave the whole thing out altogether. The only direct bearing it has now on the question is whether the omission of a provision to meet that matter is sufficient reason for us to abandon the advantage which we gain in other directions from the Declaration. My view is that it is not.<lb/>
I hope time will enable us to come to some understanding on this question, but as it stands it is worth examining a little to see what it comes to. In the first place, a good deal has been said about licensing privateers. I always feel that strong language is a mistake, and I think it is really not applicable at all; but, at any rate, if it is, we are on exceedingly delicate ground in this country as signatories of the Declaration of Paris. In the case of the conversion of a merchant ship, if it operates on the high seas, there is, under the Hague Convention, this obligation on the Power that converts it, that the ship is to be commanded by a commissioned
<col>358</col>
officer and to fly a pendant, and is to operate as a man of war, to be under the control of the State, and be placed on the registered list of warships. So that, once converted, she is subject to the same limitations as a man-of-war, and I do not think it would be accurate to describe her as being the equivalent of a privateer. It is true that the conversion may have results from privateering, but still she is not doing it for gain. She is doing it as a warship after she is converted. When you come to the question of privateering I do not quite follow it, because this does not depend on the place where the ship is commissioned, and we have the intention in our own ports of turning merchant ships into men-of-war if necessary. At one time we were going to do it on a very large scale. So you limit the question of a ship being a privateer or not to prohibition of the place where the pendant is hoisted. It is quite true they have no precedents against us of having converted a merchant ship at sea. I do not know whether there is a case against any one, but we have so converted prizes. Altogether the ground is so uncertain that it is a matter that can only be settled by further negotiation. But whether it is sufficient reason for dispensing with the advantages which, in my humble judgement, we have gained from the rest of the Declaration I will not again say. I have stated my opinion as to this.<lb/>
I think I have dealt with the subjects which have been the principal objects of criticism. As to the other matters dealt with in the Declaration, I believe the provisions are in substantial accordance with recognised principles which might very properly be accepted by us, except, of course, convoy, which we have conceded for reasons to which I really do not think anybody can object. Others who speak later may, if necessary, give explanations as to other matters, but before I sit down I should like to point out the position we are in. I am not speaking for the Government, and what I am about to say is rather a matter for the Government than for me. I only want to point out that we have clone everything we could to induce foreign Governments to believe that we wanted the International Prize Court and that we approved the Declaration. and on that basis they have
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0205"/>
<col>359</col>
made concessions. They have signed and I am a little uneasy as to what they will say if we turn round and repudiate it now, and what they would say in future negotiations with this country. I think they will in future in dealing with us want some very strong security from the Government if, having gone so far with this Declaration, it is rejected now. Do not let me be misunderstood on this matter. I am most anxious not to be misunderstood. I would not for a moment suggest that, if in fact this Declaration does injure our vital interests, our material interests, that would not prevail over any consideration. I will only say that, if we reject the Declaration, the onus is on us to show that there is good and sufficient reason why we should not carry out our agreement; but beyond that I would not go for a moment. The interests of this country must always prevail. I repeat that I believe that we have made no sacrifice of any practical belligerent right whatever, and that as neutrals we gain.<lb/>
Before I sit down I should like to repeat that, with or without the Declaration, there is one thing which stands out clear and pre-eminent. If, unhappily, we should hereafter he involved in war, it is on our own merchant fleet and not on that of neutral nations that we must rely for our food supplies, for the life-blood that pulses through our arteries, and on which our very existence as a nation must always depend. Our greatest peril, it seems to me, would be in the first fortnight of war, when there might be a commercial panic. Let our nation be assured that all Governments of whatever Party feel it their first duty to provide that our forces shall be sufficient to protect our own commerce in our own vessels, and that peril and fear will be averted. No rules can lessen that primary necessity. But by the Declaration we are substituting in the matters with which it deals fixed rules for what now approaches to chaos, and also diminishing the risk, by perhaps some ill-considered action on a disputed question, of increasing the area of war, and, at a moment of extreme pressure, adding to the number of our enemies.<lb/>
My Lords, rightly or wrongly, I honestly believe that this will be the effect of the rules in the Declaration and of the creation of the International Court, and I therefore
<col>360</col>
earnestly, and from the bottom of my heart, trust that, incomplete as I admit it is in some respects, the Declaration will take its place on the Statute book of the nations, and that those questions which still remain outside its provisions may ultimately reach a conclusion acceptable to this country. I have detained your Lordships too long, and I thank you for the great indulgence with which you have heard me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00927"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House is cordially to be congratulated, as also is the country, on having had the advantage of the very interesting and remarkable speech to which we have just listened from Lord Desart, and I am confident that I shall be voicing the opinion of all your Lordships when I say that we are glad that the moment has arrived when he is freed from his official position and can take part in the deliberations of this House. He is an additional ornament, from his own personal ability and his experience, and we welcome him here cordially from both sides of the House. It is not necessary in this House for Lord Desart to disclaim any motives in the fulfilment of his recent great responsibility other than those of pure patriotism, and whether we agree or disagree with his conclusions, we are quite sure of this, that not even the pride of paternity would have obscured his sense of patriotic duty.<lb/>
The noble Earl laid down two rules by which, in his opinion, consideration of this question should be guided, and I accept them both. The noble Earl said first, that we must consider this Declaration as a whole. As a whole would it be to the advantage of this country to ratify it? If so, it should be ratified. If, on the other hand, the disadvantages of the Declaration are regarded as greater than the advantages, then Lord Desart admitted that those who held that view would be justified in endeavouring to prevent its ratification. The second rule Lord Desart laid down was that the question must be discussed on the true basis of what the position of other nations is, and not of what we think their position ought to be.<lb/>
We cannot conceal from ourselves that this is a subject of great difficulty and complexity. No one can have such authority
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0206"/>
<col>361</col>
to speak on it as Lord Desart, but many of your Lordships, according to your opportunities, will have tried to master the leading features of the question. And the matter being so complex, I must say I regret that Mr. McKinnon Wood, who has been an able spokesman of the Government in this matter, should recently in an able and interesting speech, have endeavoured to prejudice its consideration by what I must be permitted to call a wholly irrelevant observation. He said that if this Declaration were not ratified&#x2014;
<quote>"one result would be that a new stimulus would be given to the competition in naval armament, which already was an awful burden upon the nations, and we at least would be compelled to suffer in silence for we should be responsible."</quote>
That, my Lords, is a statement which really cannot be justified or defended. Whether this Declaration is ratified or not, not one penny will be added to or taken from the Navy Estimates of this or any other country.<lb/>
It is quite impossible for any speaker to grapple with the whole of this vast subject&#x2014;not even Lord Desart attempted that. I shall not attempt to follow even the major portion of the question which he so ably dealt with. I will take only the case as it affects us as belligerents, and only that part of the case which deals with food supplies. And here I am able to quote Mr. McKinnon Wood with cordial concurrence. I do not think the position could be more completely summed up. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The real question was: Would the Declaration of London make it more difficult for this country to obtain its food supply in time of war than it was before? In this respect should we be better off by accepting or declining the Declaration? The whole of the confusion of thought which had arisen upon this subject had its origin in the fact that none of us had experience of the conditions existing under a state of war with a great naval Power, and that none of the critics had stopped to inquire into, and reflect upon, the actual state of affairs now existing before the ratification of the Declaration. If they did they would see at once that this criticism of the Declaration was quite beside the mark&#x2014;that the Declaration did not make us worse off in this respect, but better off. It was no argument against the Declaration to say that under certain conditions food might be seized by the enemy, when the fact was, at the present moment, food might be seized by the enemy without any conditions at all. He would try to put the central points as simply as possible. If food was being brought to Great Britain in British ships, the Declaration would not alter the present position in the least. If the food was being brought to Great Britain in neutral ships, the Declaration would make us much better off than we were before."</quote>
<col>362</col>
That is the position of the Government and of Lord. Desalt, and, with your Lordships' permission, I will proceed to examine it.<lb/>
What is the position now? Assume that we are, unhappily, at war with some great naval Power and that this Declaration has not been signed. Will the enemy take our view, or what has been stated to be our general view, that food supplies are only conditional contraband where it is presumed that the food is on its way to assist in the operations of the enemy and that its destination is for a naval or military force of the enemy, or for some place of naval or military equipment in the occupation of the enemy? That, I understand from the Blue-book&#x2014;Lord Desart will correct me&#x2014;is the position we took up. But let us suppose the enemy to take a more extreme view. Let us suppose that they say, as it is suggested that they might, and as I think they would say, that all foodstuffs coming to the United Kingdom were absolute contraband. In the first instance, as Lord. Desart said. we have to depend upon our own naval strength. But there is a matter which, I think, Lord Desart did not sufficiently deal with, and which, it seems to me, the Government have not laid sufficient stress on in the Foreign Office correspondence&#x2014;namely, what would be the position of the great neutral Powers if the enemy did declare all foodstuffs coming to the United Kingdom to be absolute contraband My Lords, I think that a neutral Power is in a position to put very great pressure on either side, and the possibility of that pressure has been much too lightly treated by the Foreign Office in its correspondence. The position of the belligerent Power when a neutral Power begins to make representations to it in respect of its treatment of some question of international law&#x2014;say on this question of absolute contraband in the case of foodstuffs&#x2014;would be strictly limited by two considerations: in the first place, the reserve strength of the neutral Power to make itself unpleasant if it chose to do so, and, in the second place, the calculation of the belligerent Power on how its own position would be affected if the neutral Power became another belligerent.<lb/>
We have had some experience of this matter. At the time of the South African
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0207"/>
<col>363</col>
war we regarded any representation from a neutral Power as to our action as a matter of the greatest consequence. We framed our policy&#x2014;I am quite sure the Party opposite would have done the same in similar circumstances&#x2014;in order to avoid giving any opportunity for a neutral Power to throw its weight against us. Again, in the case that has been quoted&#x2014;the case of France in 1885&#x2014;nobody can read the correspondence between France and this country at the time without seeing that the representations of Lord Granville had the greatest possible weight with the French Government and profoundly affected its action. In the recent war between Russia and Japan, had Russia thought at an early stage of that war that we were likely to throw our sword into the scale against her, is it not perfectly certain that she would have treated our representations with the very greatest respect? We were very careful at that moment of peculiar delicacy, after the incident in the North Sea, not to put any pressure on Russia that could have been construed as unduly taking advantage of her then difficulties, and if Russia did not pay all respect to representations made by the Foreign Office, I believe it was because Russia did not think at that moment we were prepared to make those matters questions of hostility. As I have said, the extent to which the representations of a neutral would be respected by a belligerent will always depend on two circumstances&#x2014;the power of the neutral to make itself felt, and the calculation of the belligerent as to whether the neutral is likely to turn belligerent. Now, apply those considerations to the case that I am supposing. Suppose an enemy Power endeavouring to stop all neutral ships bringing corn to the United Kingdom, no matter for what port destined, or to what merchant. Is it likely that the great neutral naval Powers of the world would consent to their ships being treated in that way? Is it not perfectly certain that they would make representations to which our enemy must undoubtedly listen; and therefore, even supposing the worst construction put on the law in this matter by our supposed enemy, I say that the influence of a neutral Power would be very great against the abuse of this doctrine. That is the position now.<lb/>
But, my Lords, what will the position be if this Declaration is ratified? Take Articles 33 and 34, which have been so
<col>364</col>
often quoted and round which the controversy turns. Article 33 reads&#x2014;
<quote>"Conditional contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be destined for the use of the armed forces or of a Government Department of the enemy State, unless in this latter case the circumstances show that the goods cannot in fact be used for the purposes of the war in progress. This latter exception does not apply to a consignment coming under Article 24 (4)."</quote>
Then Article 34 runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The destination referred to in Article 33 is presumed to exist if the goods are consigned to enemy authorities, or to a contractor established in the enemy country, who, as a matter of common knowledge, supplies articles of this kind to the enemy. A similar presumption arises if the goods are consigned to a fortified place belonging to the enemy, or other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy &#x2026;"</quote>
I want, first of all, to compare the words "or other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy" with the words which they replace, "Some place of naval or military equipment in the occupation of the enemy." I have a complaint against the Foreign Office, that in their correspondence they have suggested, almost insinuated, that there is no material difference between these two forms of words. I maintain that there is very material difference indeed. Let us take a concrete case. Nobody doubts that Portsmouth is "a place of naval or military equipment," or that it is also "a place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy." But take Southampton. Who could possibly contend that Southampton was "a place of naval or military equipment"? But I can imagine many people contending that Southampton was "a place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy." Therefore I say that the Foreign Office have been somewhat misleading in the suggestions they have made that there has been no material change in the substitution of one set of words for the other.<lb/>
I ask your Lordships not to look at this matter from the point of view of a Statesman in an armchair, or even from the point of view of international and Constitutional lawyers; look at it from the point of view of the enemy admiral or cruiser captain. In this connection I should like to fortify myself with another passage from Mr. McKinnon Wood. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"What the critics seem to have overlooked entirely was that if we were at war what would concern us would be not our view, but the view of the enemy."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0208"/>
<col>365</col>
With that I entirely agree. That is the whole question. What is the enemy's fleet there for? What is the main, the only, object of the admiral in charge? What are the only duties of the captains of the enemy cruisers? It is at all costs and hazards to damage this country in a maritime war. Therefore it is an essential part of his duty, so far as he possibly can, to keep supplies of foodstuffs out of this country. Therefore he will read in the largest possible sense the words&#x2014;
<quote>"or other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy."</quote>
Put yourselves, my Lords, in the position of the enemy cruiser captain. Would not be contend that the whole of the Thames must be a "base serving for the armed forces of the enemy"? Would he not say the same of the Clyde? Remember that our Territorial Army would be mobilised. The cruiser captain, in these circumstances, will be absolutely bound to contend that every important port in the United Kingdom is a place serving as a base of supply for the armed forces of England at that moment. He may, perhaps, be proved to be wrong. The International Prize Court, When the case is brought to it, might give its decision against him. But how would that help us in a war? The war would be over. The Court of International Appeal will give its decision perhaps a year or two years after the war. It is not likely that the cruiser captain will be in the least influenced by what he may think will be the eventual decision of the International Court of Appeal. If his action assisted his Government in the prosecution of the war, they will indeed not visit it heavily on him if one or two years afterwards they have to pay some indemnity under the decision of the Court. of Appeal.<lb/>
Now I come to the position of the neutral, and this is a point which has not received enough attention. I have endeavoured to show that as the law is at present a neutral Power can put great pressure on a belligerent Government if it abuses this doctrine of foodstuffs becoming absolute contraband. But if the neutral has signed this Declaration of London he can no longer put pressure on our supposed enemy. He may think that the enemy admirals are stretching the meaning of these Articles far beyond all reason, but he has signed the Declaration and ratified it. Diplomatic representations will be ignored by our enemy, and the
<col>366</col>
neutral Power will have, like ourselves, to be content with the decisions of the International Prize Court, which may be given a year or two after the termination oil the war. Therefore my answer to Lord Desart in respect to this matter is that this Declaration does put us definitely in a worse position than we are in now, even supposing the enemy were to declare all foodstuffs coming to this country to be absolute contraband. It seems to me that. it is not easy to disprove that proposition. Lord Desart has laid great stress on the fact that in such a war we have to depend on the food brought in our own ships and that unless we can protect our own sea-borne commerce by our own Navy we cannot get our salvation out of neutral bottoms. I cordially concur with the noble Earl. If we cannot protect our own ships, if we cannot hold the command of the sea, we are not going to get salvation out of neutral bottoms. There I entirely concur with the noble Earl. But surely he goes much too far when, as the corollary of that doctrine, lie says it is of no importance at all that you should get any supply from neutral bottoms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00928"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DESART</member><membercontribution>: I do not think I quite went as far as that. I said it would be of relatively small importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00929"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I am glad the noble Earl should have modified his statement. I certainly thought his first statement a very strong one, a startling one, because although I admit the importance to be only relative, yet I do say that it is to the interests of this country in war to get all the foodstuffs we can by neutral bottoms. Supply by neutral bottoms might be of great importance, and anything we do to make that supply more precarious is unnecessarily handicapping us in the conduct of a possible war in the future. If you admit that the supply of corn by neutral bottoms, in addition to the supply coming in our own ships, if you once admit that supply to be of great importance&#x2014;though relatively of small importance compared with that which is brought by our own shipping&#x2014;I think your Lordships must see that this Declaration goes very far to make that source of supply precarious. Let me read Article 40&#x2014;
<quote>"A vessel carrying contraband may be condemned if the contraband, reckoned either by value, weight, volume, or freight, forms more than half the cargo."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0209"/>
<col>367</col>
That is the position. Now, a cargo of wheat, for example, invariably forms more than half of the weight or the freight; it generally forms the whole freight of a cargo of one ship. The neutral ship, therefore, carrying a cargo of wheat to England in time of war will, if this Declaration is ratified, not only be liable to have the cargo seized, but the ship herself will be liable to be seized and condemned, because, in the opinion of the cruiser captain, coining to Glasgow, Bristol, Southampton, or the Thames she is necessarily coming to a place that is "a base of supply for the armed forces of the enemy." The owners of neutral ships would necessarily consider very carefully, therefore, before they ran such risks.<lb/>
My Lords, I should like to say a word or two about the Miscellaneous Paper No. 2, 1911, which has just been circulated by the Foreign Office. This is a reprint of the correspondence which took place in 1885 in respect of the treatment of rice as contraband. It is correspondence between Lord Granville and the French Government, and there are some rather remarkable features in it. A good deal of the Foreign Office case is based on that correspondence, and the arguments of the French Government, quoting British authorities, is certainly rather powerful. I want to draw the attention of the noble Viscount the President of the Council particularly to this fact. M. Waddington, the French Ambassador, in his despatch of March 10, 1885, quotes as part of his authority what the Attorney-General said in the House of Commons in March, 1854, and what Mr. Gladstone said in July, 1870, quoting Lord Malmesbury in 1859. These quotations were translated into French at the French Foreign Office, and now our Foreign Office have retranslated M. Waddington's despatch into English; and it is interesting to see what correspondence there is between the original extracts from <i>Hansard</i> and the Foreign Office retranslation of the French translation of <i>Hansard.</i><lb/>
I will read first the Foreign Office re-translation of the French version of what the Attorney-General said in 1854
<quote>"Contraband of War may in general be classed as follows, in two categories:
<ol>
<li>1. Articles which, by their nature, are of direct use in war, such as arms and ammunition.</li>
<li>2. Articles which may be of indirect use in war, by permitting a continuation of hostilities, such as provisions."</li></ol></quote>
<col>368</col>
I will now quote what the Attorney-General really said&#x2014;
<quote>"A recent most able treatise on International Law, which occupied thirty-four closely-printed pages, substantially classified contraband of war under two heads&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Such things as from their very nature were applicable to the purposes of war, such as arms and ammunition; and</li>
<li>2. Such things as were capable of being applied to other purposes besides those of war, but which might be intended for the furtherance of war, such as provisions."</li></ol></quote>
So that "which might be intended for the furtherance of war, such as provisions," becomes now "by permitting a continuation of hostilities, such as provisions." Does not the noble Viscount think that just a little "sloppy"?<lb/>
This is the Foreign Office version of what Mr. Gladstone said in the House of Commons on July 21, 1870, when quoting an extract from an official letter of Lord Malmesbury, dated May 18, 1859&#x2014;
<quote>"I should state that Her Majesty's Proclamation does not specify&#x2014;and could not, in fact, specify&#x2014;what articles are or are not contraband of war; and Oct the passages relating to contraband of war are not intended to prevent the export of coal, nor of any other article, but simply to warn Her Majesty's subjects that if they convey, for the use of either belligerent, articles which are held to be contraband of war, and if their property be seized by either belligerent, Her Majesty's Government will not take upon itself to intervene on their behalf against a seizure of this kind, or against its consequences. I should add that the Prize Court of the country which has made the seizure is competent to decide the case."</quote>
The real quotation taken from <i>Hansard</i> is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"I am to state to you, in reply, that Her Majesty's Proclamation does not specify, and could not properly specify, what articles are or are not contraband of war, and that the passages therein referring to contraband are intended not to prohibit the exportation of coal or any other article, but to warn Her Majesty's subjects that if they do carry, for the use of one belligerent, articles which are contraband of war, and their property be captured by another belligerent, Her Majesty's Government will not undertake to interfere in their favour against such capture or its consequences. I am to add that the Prize Court of the captor is the competent Tribunal to decide whether coal is or is not contraband of war.''</quote>
Now. I protest that there is a real difference, considering the care with which language is chosen under such circumstances and in dealing with such cases, there is a real distinction of meaning involved here; and although the noble Viscount objects to a phrase that is not his own I suggest that
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0210"/>
<col>369</col>
"sloppiness" has almost become "a mess" in this case.<lb/>
I have pointed out the difficulty, the danger almost, which appears to me to be involved in some of the Articles of this Declaration in respect of food supplies to the United Kingdom in time of war. But there are other parts of the Empire to be considered, and it does not seem to me that our representatives at this Conference did consider the effect of these provisions on other parts of the Empire. I will take the case of South Africa, which I know best. I draw your Lordships' attention to the phrase about foodstuffs becoming contraband if going to a place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy. Take the case of South Africa, which might be seriously involved in a war in which the Empire was engaged. It will certainly be argued that foodstuffs cannot go to any port in South Africa that is not "a base for the armed forces of the enemy." There are only two railway systems in British South Africa, the one that goes North by Natal from Durban and the other that goes North by Cape Colony from East London, Port Elizabeth, and Capetown. It is impossible for the armed forces of this country in any part of South Africa to be supplied from any other British ports; and it is certain&#x2014;it is not a matter of hypothesis&#x2014;that the cruiser admiral or captain would claim that foodstuffs going to these ports in South Africa were beyond all question going to places serving as "a base for the armed forces of the enemy."<lb/>
I do not wonder that a representation has been made from Australia, where a somewhat similar case may arise. And here I should like to make a confession of faith. Sir Edward Grey, in answering a question in the House of Commons as to why lie had not consulted the Dominions upon this question, said he was going to do so, but it had not been practicable at an earlier stage. Now, that answer is one which, I admit, would have been given by any Government previous to this one. My confession of faith is this&#x2014;that the time has cone by when an answer of that kind ought to be given. In a matter affecting the interests of the Empire as a whole no Government in this country ought to frame an agreement with foreign Powers and commit themselves to that agreement before taking into consultation the Dominions overseas. This Government has acted
<col>370</col>
otherwise. So far as I have ally influence, I will never be a party to such action by a Government of which I am a member. I know that the policy I have advocated is a breach of the traditions of the Foreign Office and that there are difficulties, but in my opinion it is perfectly impossible to carry with us the moral support and confidence of the Dominions if any longer we make these agreements or commit ourselves to them without consulting them. Therefore, while I am glad that His Majesty's Government are about to consult the Dominions at the forthcoming Imperial Conference, my contention is that it was practicable for them to have done so at an earlier stage, and that they ought to have done it at an earlier stage.<lb/>
My Lords, I shall not attempt to deal with the effect of the Declaration upon the conduct of a naval war. There is only one authority, in my opinion, competent to give an opinion about that, and that is the Board of Admiralty. Lord Desart had as his colleagues at this Conference two distinguished naval officers&#x2014;friends of my own whom I hold in great respect. But they are not the Board of Admiralty, and it was because they did not necessarily represent the views of the Board of Admiralty that I put the Question to-day to the Lord President of the Council. I asked him whether he could lay upon the Table the views of the Board of Admiralty. I understood from his reply three things. First, that the Government have formally consulted the Board of Admiralty; secondly, that the Government do not consider it compatible with the public interest to lay the opinion of the Board of Admiralty <i>in extenso</i> before Parliament; and, thirdly, that the opinion of the Board of Admiralty might be summarised thus: that in existing circumstances the effect of the Declaration of London and the establishment of an International Prize Court on the conduct of a naval war would be small and inconsiderable. I am glad the Government have consulted the Board of Admiralty, but I think they ought to have done it before.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00933"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think this adhesion of the Board of Admiralty can be called very enthusiastic, but if they were consulted before the Declaration was signed, of course that particular criticism falls to the ground. If they were consulted at the right moment their opinion necessarily had great weight with the Government. But supposing they were not consulted any more than the overseas Dominions were consulted before the Declaration was signed, then I must say that the Government were not justified in signing the Declaration and that their conduct is inexplicable. It is absolutely essential that the Board of Admiralty should have been consulted, because on them and on them alone will rest the responsibility for the conduct of a naval war, if a naval war unhappily should arise.<lb/>
I end, as I began, by admitting the extreme difficulty and complexity of the whole question. I have not dogmatised on the matter, but I have endeavoured to show how real and grave are the doubts which beset many of us in this House, and which doubts are reflected in public opinion in the country. It is not confined to our side, but spread over a very large section of the mercantile community. I understand what Lord Desart would have us do. He believes that the Declaration preponderates with advantage to us, and he thinks that any failure to ratify it now would be unfortunate in its consequences
<col>372</col>
in the estimation of other Powers. But in my opinion the Government did not realise, nor did Lord Desart, with all his skill, realise, all the questions and difficulties that lay within the compass of this most complex problem. If they had done so, they would have given a greater opportunity to the interests most affected in this country to make themselves heard, and to themselves to think out the questions in consultation with the Board of Admiralty and the Governments of the Oversea Dominions before committing this country so deeply as, apparently, they have done. They have now agreed to wait to have this matter discussed by the Imperial Conference, and surely it would not be inconsistent with the dignity of the Government, and it would be wholly consonant with the interests of this country, if the Government would utilise the time between now and the Imperial Conference by allowing the question to he freshly considered by some competent body of persons with impartial views who have not already taken part in the controversy. My noble friend behind me suggested a Royal Commission. I have not considered that proposal myself; it is new to me; but it is an admirable illustration of my contention and my plea that the Government should not put their foot down. We may be wrong, my fears may be groundless, but the step, once taken, cannot be retraced. I would plead for further consideration, and that the Government should not reject all suggestions for probing this question to the bottom.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE DECLARATION OF LONDON.</title>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00975"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships have heard already enough in this debate to satisfy you that the subject-matter of it is of great complication and also of great delicacy. It covers a very wide field. There is, one might say, almost a literature connected with each of the controverted topics, and there has been a great deal of discussion out of doors&#x2014;a great deal of natural and reasonable discussion. I think I am not wrong in saying also that there has been some mischievous and unfair criticism of this document. I recognise the impartial spirit in which the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, on behalf of the Opposition, treated this matter. I think he must be aware as well as any of us that those responsible members of either House of Parliament who speak upon this subject are liable to have their words quoted, possibly in some future discussions between this and other countries, as admitting propositions unfavourable to the interests of our own country; and I would respectfully suggest to noble Lords who intend to speak, if they will allow me to do so with great respect, that we all of us should be very careful, however strongly we may feel in a hostile sense to any of the provisions of this Declaration, so to express ourselves as not to give a handle that may be laid hold of against our national interests.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0214"/>
<col>377</col>
The real question here, so far as this Declaration is concerned, is this&#x2014;when nations are fighting on the great highway of the ocean, on what conditions are neutrals to be protected&#x2014;what are the rights that are to be allowed to neutrals when they are in the midst of a scuffle of fighting forces on the great highway of the world? it may be asked, Why was any agreement needed at all? The answer is to be found in the history of the last 120 or 130 years, which I need not say I do not intend to inflict upon your Lordships, but to which I shall refer with the utmost brevity. In the old times the British Navy enforced belligerent rights with great strictness, and there were constant protests. Your Lordships will remember the two armed neutralities and also the war with the United. States in 1812, and, further, that this country was obliged from time to time itself to make concessions or departures from the extreme rights which it had asserted, because they were intolerable to many other nations. We were fighting at that time for our existence., and we held on to those rules so long as we could. By the end of the Napoleonic wars one thing was clear, and that was that each nation was its own judge so far as international law was concerned, and interpreted its own laws by its Prize Courts without appeal, causing an immense variety and. conflict of different opinions in different countries. Also a Code of Maritime Law had been constructed under the conditions of British naval supremacy which bore very severely upon neutrals. This was throughout dissented from by a great number of nations, and there were vehement protests from time to time.<lb/>
Gradually during the nineteenth century Great Britain began to feel that she had an interest as a neutral Power as well as an interest as a belligerent, upon which we dwelt during the great stress of the Napoleonic wars. That first found expression in 1856, when the Declaration of Paris was agreed to, which gave effect to the rule of free ships and free goods and also abolished privateering. I will not enter for a moment upon the merits of that Declaration. Whether we were right or wrong to enter upon it, it was a concession&#x2014;an inevitable concession&#x2014;by this country to the strain and stress of foreign and neutral Powers against the code of laws which we had before established. Then
<col>378</col>
came other wars&#x2014;the American Civil War, the Franco-German War, the South African War, and the Russo-Japanese War, some of which were fertile in, all of which gave occasion to, disputes in regard to the problems of maritime law and neutrality. We found a great variety of opinion, each State being a law to itself, with an inevitable succession of conflicts threatening at times to involve actual collision between the belligerents and neutral Powers.<lb/>
The last and most important of these wars for this purpose was the Russo-Japanese War within the last few years. We were then neutral. There was immense complaint on the part of our merchants against the conduct of Russia, one of the belligerents, because Russia asserted a law differing from that which we had explicitly recognised, and determined, as we had always done in the past, that the law of Russia should be applied in her own Courts without any appeal. Members of the late Cabinet will recollect, I have no doubt, disputes about various ships, the names of which I have forgotten, which were destroyed. Neutral ships carrying contraband were destroyed, and were not taken into port for adjudication. Our Government complained about it. The Russians stood firm. What was the alternative presented to us in the years 1904 and 1905? Either to drop our complaints without compensation to our merchants, or to have recourse to the arbitrament of war. It was in those circumstances that the commercial classes of this country began to realise more fully a sense of that which had been gradually growing, that we had interests as neutrals, by reason of our vast commerce, exceeding by far the interests of other countries&#x2014;interests which could not be disregarded in considering what the law ought to be on a subject like this. The theme upon which our commercial men chiefly dwelt on that occasion was the uncertainty of the law. The men whom we wish to protect are those who have innocent commercial enterprises in hand. It is legitimate to run a blockade, it is legitimate to take the risk of carrying contraband; but you do it knowing the risk. While, of course, we ought to see that the interests of our merchants who do that are fairly treated, they are comparatively few in number, and our real and main interest is that those who wish peaceably to carry on their trade with a belligerent country should know without controversy what goods they can
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0215"/>
<col>379</col>
carry and what class of goods they should avoid.<lb/>
In those circumstances there were these doubts and difficulties: in the first place, each nation was a law to itself in its own Prize Courts, and secondly. the law they applied was doubtful and uncertain, and the consequence was perplexity and embarrassment to our traders. That being so, the first thing was to secure an International Prize Court. We have done so under the twelfth Convention. At present, any nation has its own Prize Courts without appeal. We have now secured a right of appeal. It is clearly an advantage to us if we are neutral, as the illustration of Russia in the Japanese war shows. We can trust a tribunal of even comparatively disinterested nations rather than of a nation at war and perhaps fighting for its life; and if we are to get this advantage, by what right are we to refuse it to other nations? When we are at war we shall then be a nation interfering with neutrals and liable to their pressure in the midst of our own great difficulties. What should we do? We should often do what we did in the case of the Bundesrath during the South African War. We should give way, even though the seizure were justified, in our opinion, by law. We should give way in order to avoid complication and difficulty, even if we were right. Now we shall have an opportunity of saying, after the Declaration has been ratified, that we prefer to go before the International Prize Court, and then we shall get our rights. Our only disadvantage is the possibility of a perverse judgment from this new Court. I do not think we are likely to have a perverse judgment from nations which are not interested in the quarrel which is going on. I think we are more likely to have a fair judgment than from the Court of a belligerent nation. There was one observation made by my noble friend Lord Desborough which I think he could not quite intend with regard to this International Prize Court. He said that the Court would make the law. But what are the words of the Convention?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00976"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: I think I said that M. Renault had appended to that Convention a very similar Report to that which he appended to the Declaration of London, and that in his Report he distinctly stated that the Court was to make the law.

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00977"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry I do not know the passage in the Report to which the noble Lord has referred, but I am quite sure the noble Lord's statement is made in entire good faith. But these are the words of the seventh Article&#x2014;
<quote>"If a question of law to be decided is governed by a Treaty in force between the belligerent captor and a Power which is itself, or the subject or citizen of which is, party to the proceedings, the Court is governed by the provisions of the said Treaty. In the absence of such provisions the Court shall apply the rules of international law. If no generally recognised rule exists the Court shall give judgment in accordance with the general principles of justice and equity."</quote>
I do not think anybody could ask for a fairer rule.<lb/>
Having settled in the Convention that there shall be an International Prize Court, the next thing was to try and raise from chaos into something like order the rules which this Court was to apply upon disputed points, and to ascertain and amend doubtful points of international law. That is what has been done in this Declaration, so far as we could prevail upon other nations to agree. You cannot compel people to agree, but you can try, and meet, and see if you cannot come to some common principle.<lb/>
I am happy to think that of all the proposals made in this Declaration&#x2014;and they are numerous&#x2014;there are very few that are really objected to. Let me deal with them one by one. Complaint has been made of the rules laid down to govern blockade. Let me shortly tell your Lordships what the old English rule was and how far we have given way and how far other nations have given way. The old English rule was that you could seize a neutral ship at any point on the voyage to the blockaded port, and if she was coming out of the blockaded port you could seize her at any time until she reached a neutral port. Some Powers held that you must actually inscribe the notice of blockade on the ship's papers before you capture her. In other words, that she can have what the English law gives to every dog, one worry, before she is regarded as a ship liable to capture. That is making blockade illusory. Other Powers
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0216"/>
<col>381</col>
held the rule that you must have a line laid down, and a ship could not be captured unless she was clearly about to cross that line. That also tended to make blockade illusory.<lb/>
The Declaration proposes that no notice need be inscribed on the ship's papers and that knowledge of blockade alone, however acquired, is sufficient. That was our rule. But it says that the offending vessel must be captured by a ship of the blockading force which may pursue her. You may have swift ships outside the port; two or three lines of the blockading force; outlying ships notified by wireless telegraphy, which may pursue her. Under the Declaration they may pursue her as far as a neutral port to say the least of it. In substance this is the old English rule with a very slight alteration. We give up, it is true, the right of capture at any point in the voyage to the blockaded port, which is a very small matter. How small a matter it is I will give your Lordships the means of judging, because I am informed by the Foreign Office, and no doubt it is true, that out of the eighty-eight reported cases in the legal annals of this country which relate to blockade there is not one in which this point arose. How insignificant, how unimportant, this point is, and how almost completely we have got our own way on the subject of blockade I have endeavoured to show.<lb/>
Let me come to the next point in the Declaration&#x2014;that dealing with contraband. The differences on this subject between the different Powers are extremely serious. We have, as I have said, the experience of the: Russo-Japanese war when many British ships were captured, and there was loud complaint in England and some of the Chambers of Commerce informed the Government that it had been found in many quarters necessary to give up trading with Japan by reason of the action of the Russian Government and her cruisers. Accordingly our great point was to make it as clear as we could what was not contraband in any circumstances, what was contraband in certain special circumstances, and what might always be treated as contraband, so as to enable merchants to know what they could and could not ship safely. There is a list of free goods agreed to in the Declaration which gives absolute security so far as that list goes. There is also a list of absolute contraband. There cannot be objection made to that, because
<col>382</col>
it nearly all consists of gunpowder, arms, saddlery, and things exclusively used for the purposes of war. The meaning of the rules which I summarise throughout because it would take me hours to read every word is this. The neutral ships must not carry belligerent implements or materials of war specified in the list, but, considering the advance of science and the possibility of new discoveries, belligerents may add by public declaration and notification to that list other articles, provided that they are articles exclusively used in war. Accordingly our merchants will know very well what to avoid if they are going to deliver goods in belligerent countries.<lb/>
I now come to conditional contraband&#x2014;that is to say, contraband only in special circumstances. Goods susceptible for use in war, as well as for the purposes of peace, will always be regarded as being possibly and sometimes treated as contraband. There is a list, also, of conditional contraband provided in the Declaration. So far as I have heard in this debate, and so far as I know, although I do not pretend to be as diligent a student of the newspaper Press as perhaps I ought to be, there is no complaint as to any article included in that list except foodstuffs&#x2014;a most important article, of course, I quite agree, and one on which the whole of this controversy really turns. A great deal of complaint and clamour, and, I venture respectfully to think, not always very well-informed or well-instructed clamour, has arisen because we have agreed in this list that foodstuffs may in certain circumstances be regarded and treated as contraband of war. People speak as if it is the final abandonment by this country of all the principles that we have insisted upon. Great Britain has always treated foodstuffs as being conditional contraband&#x2014;that is to say, as being matter which may or may not be contraband according to the circumstances of the case. No one who knows the subject will question that. So have all other countries. You can perfectly well imagine that in some circumstances the supply of food to an enemy may save his army from utter destruction, and may be of far more assistance to him and more prejudicial to the other belligerent than the supply of any number of pistols, rifles, and ammunition of war.<lb/>
The difference between us and other countries with regard to the treatment of foodstuffs has been very wide and marked,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0217"/>
<col>383</col>
but it has not been with regard to the right to treat foodstuffs as conditional contraband, but as to the circumstances in which foodstuffs can be so treated. There is history connected with this branch of the subject. As I understand the documents, Blue-books and historical accounts, France, Germany and Russia have at times asserted that foodstuffs were liable to be seized under all circumstances&#x2014;not any special circumstances, but in all circumstances&#x2014;to whatever port they were destined if they were destined to a belligerent port. That would be most dangerous indeed to the interests of this country if it were allowed, because we are dependent more than any other nation in the world upon imported food. The British rule was that foodstuffs could be captured only if their destination was in effect to help the fighting forces of the belligerent. I think myself, and I hope your Lordships who have studied the documents will consider, that the Declaration does in very little depart from the British rule adapted to modern circumstances.<lb/>
Let me summarise the effect of Articles 33 and 34 to which Lord Selborne drew particular attention, and which, indeed, I admit are of great moment in connection with this subject. Henceforth foodstuffs are free unless they come within Articles 33 and 34. They are contraband if they come within 33 and 34. They are contraband if they are destined for the use of the armed forces of the enemy or of a Government Department of the enemy State. And according to the Declaration they are presumed, though the contrary may be proved, to be so destined if they are consigned to the enemy authorities or consigned to a trader established in the enemy country who, as a matter of common knowledge, supplies articles of this kind to the enemy. It has been pointed out that supplying articles of this kind to the enemy may mean to the individual enemy and not to the enemy Government. Sir Edward Grey has stated that when we ratify this Declaration we shall make it clear that all we agreed to is that it should mean "supplied to the enemy Government." Food supplies are also, under the Declaration, presumed to be contraband if they are consigned to a fortified place belonging to the enemy or to another place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy.<lb/>
I will advert in one moment to the phrase that was commented upon, "base
<col>384</col>
for the armed forces of the enemy," but is not that on the whole very near the English rule as regards foodstuffs being treated as contraband of war, subject only to the point made about the words, "a base for the armed forces of the enemy"? In my opinion that does not, and cannot, apply in the case of our being at war, to all the ports in England, as one noble Lord suggested it would. It cannot so apply, and when he asks us to give an illustration. I say for instance the port of Bristol. But may I take this attitude, which I believe your Lordships will accept and will assent to? I do not think it is possible to say, "serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy" would enable an enemy to treat all the ports of England as a base for our armed forces, otherwise it would reduce the Articles to an absurdity. And I do hope that no one of your Lordships, or no responsible writer in this country, will give countenance to an idea of that kind in any speech he may make or any letter he may write.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00978"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: The report distinctly states "base of supply." That is a very important point. The original document is enlarged into "base of supply," not merely "armed place."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00979"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I think your Lordships would not desire or think it appropriate that I should enter upon a legal argument upon that subject before your Lordships. I ask you to accept as my opinion, about which I entertain no real doubt, that you could not treat any port, except ports which are actually magazines for war or actually places of equipment for war, as being within the term "base for the armed forces of the enemy."<lb/>
Let me pass on, on the subject of contraband, to the only other point that remains. Some nations, notably America, have asserted that if the ultimate destination of a cargo of food or other conditional contraband is to the enemy, you may seize it even if its primary destination is a neutral port. An illustration may be given. Supposing, for example, we were, which Heaven forbid we ever should be, engaged in a war against Germany. According to the American doctrine, which was applied in their Civil War, you might stop conditional contraband destined for Germany which was to be delivered in the first instance at Rotterdam.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0218"/>
<col>385</col>
The British rule has never been clearly defined, although we acquiesced in practice during the American Civil War in the American doctrine. The Declaration of London abolishes this doctrine, which is known as the doctrine of continuous voyage, for conditional contraband&#x2014;that is to say, for food&#x2014;and establishes it for absolute contraband. Were we right in agreeing to this in the first place, it was difficult for us if we wished to oppose it, because we could not say absolutely that it was contrary to the British rule. But ought we to resist it? Is it to our disadvantage? We are more in need of foreign supplies of food than any nation in the world.<lb/>
The Declaration in this particular facilitates the supply of food through a neutral port. Suppose we were at war with Germany. Food could come from America under the Declaration of Paris quite free 'and safe to a French port and be run across the Channel, even if we had lost command of the sea&#x2014;or, at least, it would have a chance of running across the Channel. I admit, on the other hand, that food could be safely supplied to Germany through Rotterdam under this Declaration. Which stands to gain most by the Declaration facilitating this kind of trade? I say Great Britain stands to gain most, because we are more dependent upon foreign food, and because we cannot, and Germany can, get food supplies by land transit across her frontiers. The Declaration of Paris in this respect can be no more than convenient to Germany. It may be absolutely vital for our advantage. Let me take another illustration, because a great deal of attack has been levelled against this part of the Declaration. Let me again suppose that we are at war with Germany. A ship laden with food starts from America for one of the belligerent countries, Great Britain. Suppose her bound for Bristol. If you reject the Declaration, Germany might claim to seize her on her way. If you accept the Declaration, Germany could not seize her. But suppose she is bound for Havre, a neutral port. If you reject the Declaration, Germany might seize her under the doctrine of continuous voyage. If you accept the Declaration, Germany could not seize her, because she was destined for Havre, which is a neutral port. I think this is distinctly in our favour if we are belligerents; and it is admittedly in our favour if we are neutrals, because it enlarges our opportunity of trade and commerce.<lb/>
<col>386</col>
I pass now to the destruction of neutral prizes, which has been the subject of attack by many people. All nations assert the right to destroy neutral prizes, if they find they cannot take them into a port, except Great Britain, Japan, Spain, and Holland. That is the law which they would apply in their Prize Courts if you reject this Declaration. Even the record of Great Britain is not quite clear upon this subject of the destruction of neutral ships. The Declaration allows it, but allows it subject to distinct conditions. The ship may be destroyed if the observance of Article 48&#x2014;that means taking her into a port for adjudication&#x2014;would involve danger to the safety of the warship or to the success of the operations in which she is engaged at the time. Supposing we reject this Declaration. Our enemy would destroy neutral prizes at discretion, without any limitation at all, acting upon her own law. But suppose that we are neutral and our merchant ships are destroyed? This actually happened, as we know, in the Russo-Japanese war. We were then put to the choice I have referred to, either of allowing the incident to pass uncompensated, or of having recourse to war with Russia. Of course, the late Government, like sensible men, never thought of making that a subject of a declaration of war. If that happened again after this Declaration has been ratified Russia would have to submit to the International Court and to pay compensation if she was found to be wrong. These are the only points in this Declaration which have been made, I think, the subject of attack in this House, and they are the chief points, almost the only material points, which are attacked in the campaign outside this House.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Desborough, complained that no provision appears in the Declaration to deal with the difficult point of the conversion of merchant ships into war vessels on the high seas. Nations differ upon this subject, and it was found impossible to arrive at an agreement. We should have liked to have arrived at an agreement very much, but we could not because other people would not agree to it. Is it not a strange subject of complaint that having done our best to agree with other nations, we found that other nations were not willing to agree with us? The only real point is this, whether, being unable to get agreement upon this point, and therefore being obliged to leave the point in the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0219"/>
<col>387</col>
chaos of uncertainty and obscurity in which it now rests, we were to refuse to agree to all the other terms which the other Powers were willing to give us? That is the point.<lb/>
Now what does it all come to? So far as this Declaration touches the law we gain certainty for our shipowners and our merchants by laying down rules which, if they are observed, can make their commerce safe. Then, do we pay too high a price for it? Every one will agree that certainty of that kind is a very desirable thing if we do not pay too high a price. I have endeavoured to show your Lordships. by examining point by point the different changes that have been made, that as a whole we have not lost but actually gained. It has not been for us to consider what price we would pay. There has been no price paid. It is a profit and not a payment of price. We submit decisions of our own Courts to an international tribunal. That is true. My Lords, that only affects cases in which we have captured or arrested neutral vessels. Even if the international tribunal were biassed&#x2014;an assumption which, I hope. will not be made in regard to all the great nations of the world&#x2014;the subjects that the International Prize Court can deal with are not of such magnitude that they can vitally affect us. My noble friend Lord Desart said, in his admirable speech, much upon that point which was well worthy of reflection. On the other hand, whenever our vessels, being neutral, are captured or arrested, we have an appeal from the belligerent Prize Court to the International Court, which we did not have before, and in either case, seeing that the great source of difficulty and embarrassment has been the friction arising between a belligerent and a neutral, it must be remembered that we have the means under this Declaration of avoiding friction with nations with which we are at peace, by referring disputes between us to this international tribunal. We also obtain by the Declaration the law which all Prize Courts are to administer. In regard to blockades we get substantially, I think, our own law. In regard to contraband we get better security for our food supplies than we might or probably should have had if foreign nations had been left to apply their own law. And in regard to the destruction of neutral ships we make a doubtful concession, having regard to
<col>388</col>
our own previous practice, but we limit the rights now asserted by nearly all the Powers of the world.<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to bear in mind that we are not the only nation in the world. We are not the only maritime or commercial nation in the world. If we wish, as some writers apparently desire that we should, to stand by our own law even to the last jot and tittle, if we are to refuse such concessions in return for the advantages which I have endeavoured to place before your Lordships, if we are to do that after we have ourselves been the people to invite the consideration of other nations, it would be treated as a defiance of the opinion of the world. It means an attitude of obstinacy and hostility; and although I am, and I hope always shall be, ready to vote the necessary supplies for the defence of this country, I am not sure that everybody would be ready to vote the necessary supplies if we are to take up the attitude which in some quarters we are asked to take up, instead of an attitude of reasonable, sensible, fair adjustment of difficulties. The other course is to agree with our neighbours all over the world and to remember that the points in difference, if you examine them, do not really as practical matters come to anything very great.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00980"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Lord has given a note of warning that we must not discuss the construction of the Declaration lest we should put arguments in the mouth of our antagonists. It is very difficult to discuss the propriety or impropriety of any of the Articles without knowing the construction that is to be placed upon them, and it will be difficult to show their injurious effect upon this country. The Motion, I would remind the House, is not a Motion to reject the Declaration, but seeks to establish a Royal Commission that this and other matters may be freely discussed before the very serious decision is taken of ratifying it. One of the most important parts of this question appears not to have been brought to the noble and learned Lord's attention, for lie attempted to correct Lord Desborough in his statement that this international Prize Court will make the law. What Lord Desborough said is perfectly accurate. M. Renault's Report is treated by the Secretary of State as well as in the Papers which accompany the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0220"/>
<col>389</col>
Declaration as an authoritative document. Let me read to the noble and learned Lord what M. Renault says&#x2014;
<quote>"This international Prize Court is called upon to make the law &#x2026;</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00981"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: What is the page?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00982"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I have not got the original here, but only a copy. There is, however, no doubt about the fact. The Court is to have no system of proofs, but is to "appreciate," whatever that means. Of all statements the boldest I have ever heard is that by this Declaration you will gain certainty in the law. Than this Declaration, and in face of the Report of M. Renault, I cannot understand anything more unlikely to secure certainty. Are we or are we not to have a new system of international law Is it to be that the new International Prize Court is not to be bound by three centuries of legal decisions, and that there is to be administered a new system of jurisprudence of which we have never heard before? It seems to me that we are now for the first time abandoning all those principles which have hitherto guided us and are making the Declaration of London the sole authority for the International Court. We must disregard the authority of Grotius, of whom Hallam said that his work created a new epoch, of Story, of Pufendorf, of Bynkershoek, of Sir William Scott, afterwards Lord Stowell, and others. I deprecate that very much. It seems to me that we must first of all ascertain whether this accompanying document is or is not a part of the Declaration, because in the opinion of many persons it is a document which appears to modify the Declaration of London. A question to this effect has been asked, but I do not find that any answer has been given to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00983"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I would like to know the page reference to the document to which the noble Earl refers. I may say, however, that I agree with the answer given by Mr. McKinnon Wood in the House of Commons and by Lord Desart that it is an official commentary which would be regarded by any Court which would have the Convention before it. I think that the Convention is perfectly clear, for it says that the Court has to recognise the rules of international law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00984"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to have that explanation, though I fear that
<col>390</col>
it is not satisfactory. What I want to know is what is the nature of this document and whether it is to be accepted as being authoritative or not? The question has not been answered whether or not it is to be a part of the Declaration of London and what that Declaration is expected to include. But what seems to me to be important is to know the system of law to be administered. I gather from the noble and learned Lord that the ordinary principles of international law are to be applied; but what about the proofs? Apparently there are to be no legal proofs and the Court itself must appreciate what is put before it. But I do not know what that procedure is to be, not what the proofs are to be. Are they to be the ordinary proofs required in International Courts, and, if so, what is the meaning of the disclaimers of proofs?<lb/>
In my view the whole tone of this Declaration is very hostile to whatever Power in the world happens to be the great naval Power; and at present, at all events, Great Britain is that Power. The noble and learned Lord has truly said that our peculiar position as an island makes us particularly sensitive to any abridgment of our powers of supply; and the question is whether the Declaration we are asked to sanction does or does not assist us. The case of Bristol has been quoted. The great difference between that which is laid down in the Declaration of London and that which was the law before is that by and in language reasonably clear foodstuffs could only be made contraband of war when intended to be supplied to a fort or to some place in actual military occupation and forming part, as it were, of the occupying military forces of the country. Now the Declaration of London has altered that; and any place which is a place of supply to the enemy is itself made a destination which would render foodstuffs absolute contraband of war. In the circumstances, what would Bristol be? There would hardly be a more likely place for a military force, and if there was a military force in Bristol it would be within this Declaration. Instead of being really and truly a case of preventing supplies going to a military force it would be applicable to the whole civil population, and whatever might be the exigencies of the civil population in respect of food, yet because the food was going to Bristol which might form a base for military
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0221"/>
<col>391</col>
occupation, it would be within the Declaration of London.<lb/>
I think that the noble and learned Lord has overstated what the old rule was. It has never been admitted that foodstuffs were an absolute contraband of war, and Lord Granville protested against that view in the most energetic manner. If one goes through the different things that are altered by the Declaration it is impossible not to observe that the tendency throughout has been against Great Britain and not in favour of Great Britain. Having gone through with great care the book written by Mr. Bowles&#x2014;to my mind an extremely accurate account, not overstated&#x2014;I find that it is pointed out with great force that on every occasion what Great Britain contended for has been overthrown. Great Britain, therefore, is in a very different position from what it formerly occupied. I do not propose to discuss the Declaration of Paris. But while I deny the sacro-sanctity of the Declaration of Paris or that it is impossible to get rid of it, I would observe that it was denounced by Mr. Bright, by Mr. John Stuart Mill, and other distinguished members of the Party to which the noble Viscount belongs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00985"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: It is quite true that Mr. Mill did demur to it on the very curious ground that the more horrible you made war the less you would have of it; but he afterwards withdrew that opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00986"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I read Mr. Mill's denunciation but not his withdrawal. Then there is the question of the conversion of merchantmen into warships. That can be done at sea. Under former rules the fitting out was carried out at their own ports, but now merchant vessels can become warships during their voyage. If it happens to he fitted into a vessel which may serve as a warship it may lie in wait on a trade route and capture any ship it comes across. It may be said that that is to some extent affected by the Treaty of Paris, because it is in the nature of privateering. I do not think it would, but I will not argue that point lest I should be arguing something to the disadvantage of my own country. But, again, what is the good of doing that which certainly can do us no good and which may be the subject of very serious injury to this country?<lb/>
<col>392</col>
It seems to me that the whole theory has been something in the nature of a belief that if war were made very polite it could be got rid of altogether. I do not believe anything of the sort. People who believe in peace and are very fond of giving way have the oddest possible mode of trying to procure peace. I remember a very excellent clergyman who went to put a stop to a prize fight arranged by a party of colliers. He was personally popular, but many of the colliers who did not like their fight interfered with were inclined to treat him very roughly. When that was seen, his parishioners determined that he should not be ill-treated, and the result was that. instead of the prize fight there was a riot of about 500 people, and I do not know how many were injured. This illustrates the method of people who are very fond of peace and believe in the perfect goodness of a human nature which I am afraid is too strong for them. I earnestly entreat the Lord Chancellor to consider the question of what law is to be administered and to give it the importance it deserves in considering whether we are or are not to look at M. Renault's Report as authoritative. If the Court is to "appreciate," whatever that means, and to determine not according to any fixed law, but according to their own views of what is to be done, so far from the Declaration leading to peace, I believe it to be one from which Great Britain may lose a great deal, while gaining nothing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00987"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I take it that the object of this Declaration is an attempt to codify as far as possible certain rules of international law. In so far as there are no Treaties binding the parties and no codification, it is obvious that the International Prize Court will apply the generally recognised rules of international law, and where no such rule exists the Court shall give judgment in accordance with the general principles of justice and equity. Article 7 of the Convention relative to the establishment of an International Prize Court imposes this procedure on the Court. We cannot expect to obtain from other Powers a complete assent to our own interpretation of the rules of international law. It is quite clear that we could not insist on concessions being made by other Powers which would cripple and paralyse their means of offence and defence, and which we ourselves should not make in a similar situation. Therefore,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0222"/>
<col>393</col>
when we enter upon international negotiations on a question of tins kind we must be prepared to give and take and to make certain concessions. We have to choose between using our influence to obtain the best terms we can in this process of codification, or remain outside and see doctrines sanctioned by international conventions to which we are no parties, and to which we are opposed.<lb/>
Let us suppose that we decline to ratify the Convention with regard to the International Prize Court, and that an International Prize Court is constituted on which we are not represented. The result would be that in the event of condemnation of one of our ships by a Prize Court of a belligerent when we were neutral, there would be no appeal. In addition, we should not be represented on the International Court, whereas if we took part in its proceedings it would obviously be the duty of our representative to insist as far as possible that those principles which have been so admirably laid down by our Prize Courts should be adopted by the International Prize Court. This Court will, of course, be composed of the best men who can be appointed by the various Governments who are entrusted with the selection, and this seems to me to give us every guarantee of that impartiality which at the present moment, when we are only liable to the jurisdiction of the Prize Court of the belligerent., we have not got. What has been our experience of Arbitration Courts in regard to the Venezuelan Claims, the Japanese House Tax, the Muscat Dhows, the North Atlantic Fisheries, and quite lately the Savarkar case? In all those cases the decision has been in our favour. There is no reason why the same result should not be anticipated when this international Prize Court is constituted on the same lines as the Arbitration Courts.<lb/>
With regard to contraband, I am still of opinion that our proposal at the last Peace Conference to abolish it would have been the best solution. That proposal, which I had the honour, in accordance with our instructions, to submit to the Hague Conference, there met with the support of the majority, twenty-five Powers giving their adhesion. I am quite aware that the Powers who opposed it made it impossible for our delegates at the London Conference to insist again on this abolition. But I regret that in this Declaration the power
<col>394</col>
given to a belligerent to add by notification to the list of absolute and conditional contraband is not made subject, to some limitations, for instance, it might have been considered whether the lists of absolute and conditional contraband should not have been left to a Committee of the Hague Conference for periodical revision. But I submit that the absolute contraband list, which is the same as that which we settled at the Hague, and especially the free list, offer very great advantages to us. On the free list appear a great many articles in which we are very much interested.<lb/>
As to the rules for conditional contraband, neutral ships with a destination to neutral harbours cannot be captured. Therefore, if we are at war neutral ships will carry our supplies to neutral harbours in the vicinity of our shores, and thence we shall be able to protect them on their way to our harbours. We cannot rely only on neutral ships. We must rely on our own ships. in any case the question of our food supplies depends, and depends almost exclusively, on our superiority at sea and on keeping our lines of communication open. At the same time we shall derive this advantage, for instance in India, that in case of war neutral ships will be able to carry their supplies to Goa, whence India could easily be supplied; and if the United States are neutral, Canada would be supplied by her great neighbour. The doctrine of continuous voyage will in future, according to this Declaration, only apply to absolute contraband. I entirely agree with the argument used by my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Desart) yesterday that the application of the doctrine of continuous voyage to conditional contraband, however logical it might be, would in practice offer such difficulties that it would prove useless. Besides the friction which would result from the application of the doctrine to neutral trade would rouse the hostility of neutral Powers at. a time when, of course, our object must be as much as possible to conciliate them. With regard to the destruction of neutral prizes, after all that has been said by my noble friend on the Cross Benches I will not go into the subject; but I agree with him that the conditions imposed by the Declaration will make it in most cases almost imperative on the commanding officer of a belligerent cruiser to dismiss the ship in order to avoid
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0223"/>
<col>395</col>
the risk of having to pay heavy compensation as a result of subsequent adjudication.<lb/>
Now, with regard to the conversion of merchant vessels in time of war on the high seas, that has not been prohibited. We have maintained our objection to the process, but it is quite clear that at the present moment there is no rule in international law to which we could appeal in order to get our view incorporated in the Code. I would call the attention of the House to the fact that the Convention which is known as Convention No. 7, which we negotiated at the Hague, imposes many limitations on the conversion, and in any case excludes the possibility of privateering being revived. The noble and learned Earl who has just spoken admitted that the conversion was not affected by the Declaration of Paris. There is no reason to suppose that the converted merchant ships, if the conditions defined by the Convention are carried out, will not be<i>bona fide</i>men-of-war. Moreover, the Preamble of the Convention states very definitely that&#x2014;
<quote>"the question of the place where such conversion is effected remains outside the scope of this Agreement, and is in no way affected by the following rules."</quote>
As the Declaration does not allude to this subject our attitude with regard to it is absolutely unprejudiced.<lb/>
It seems to me that the objections urged against the Declaration are really objections directed against the whole policy of entering upon any negotiations with other Powers for the settlement of questions relating to international law. I think that the noble Earl and his colleagues have every reason to be satisfied with the results they have obtained at the Conference, especially with regard to blockade, unneutral service, transfer to a neutral flag, and compensation. When I compare the results which he has obtained and those which we were able to obtain at the Hague, and the gaps which he has filled in which were left open at the Hague, I think the progress made after such a short interval is very encouraging for further agreement on points which have been left open at the London Conferences; and I may inform the House that it is not only my opinion, but it is the opinion of my three colleagues at the Hague Conference&#x2014;Sir Edward Fry, Sir Ernest Satow, and Sir Henry Howard&#x2014;who are strongly in favour of the ratification of this
<col>396</col>
Declaration. As to what has been said about M. Renault's Report, I think it will be desirable, if the Government wish that Report to be authoritative for the International Court, that it should also be ratified by us and the other Powers. There is a certain risk that without such ratification the International Court will look upon that document as interpreting what the intentions were of the delegates to the London Conference, but not as a document by which they are themselves bound in interpreting the Declaration of London. I submit that for the consideration of His Majesty's Government if it is their opinion that such authority should attach to the Report.<lb/>
There are at present two currents&#x2014;one in the direction of settlement of international disputes by international agreement; the other in the direction of increased armaments. We cannot ignore either without detriment to our national safety. If we abstain from joining these Conferences, or make settlement or compromise difficult, we cause irritation among nations with whom we ought to be on friendly terms. To repudiate this Declaration would undoubtedly constitute a very deplorable precedent, and render it more difficult hereafter for our representatives to obtain amendments&#x2014;this instrument obviously is not perfect&#x2014;amendments which we might on a future occasion desire to obtain. I cannot conceive a more impolitic step than the rejection of this Declaration and of the International Prize Court, after we have proposed the Prize Court at the Hague, and after we have invited other Powers in London to consider what the rules should be which this Court should observe in dealing with appeals brought before it.<lb/>
A lurid picture is occasionally drawn of a conspiracy of the Continental Powers against us, and the delegates at the Hague, and now again our representatives at the London Conference, are accused of having surrendered important rights. I am sure that was not the impression of the foreign representatives, either at the Hague or at the London Conference. They were well aware that both at the Hague and London we vigorously maintained our rights, and only accepted such proposals as did not in any way weaken our means of offence or defence either as a belligerent or as a neutral. The Conventions of the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0224"/>
<col>397</col>
Hague Conference and the London Declaration will enable us to vindicate our rights by means which at present we do not possess owing to the existing uncertainty of the law. What is that uncertainty? What did Mr. Royden, the Chairman of the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association say on February 6? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"International law as it now exists is little better than a farce and in too many cases justice cannot be obtained at the hands of the Prize Courts of the captors."</quote>
That was the experience of British shipowners during the last war in the Far East, and to remove that uncertainty and to turn international law from a farce into a Code which can be understood and which can be enforced, has been the object of our representatives at the Hague and at the London Conferences. I trust your Lordships will be disposed to approve of the results they have been able to obtain after very exhaustive and protracted negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00988"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are deeply indebted to international lawyers for the pains they have taken in establishing Arbitration Courts to settle minor disputes between nations, so as to prevent nations drifting into war when tempers have become irritated about trifles. I congratulate the noble Earl on the Cross Benches on the results of his recent visit to The Hague. It is just on such occasions as that that international lawyers are able to render valuable service to their country. I wish them every success in their endeavours to improve commercial international law, and in every effort they may make towards insuring peaceful solutions of international disputes. But they exceed the legal limit when they try to dictate the rules of war. Then they get out of their depth.<lb/>
International lawyers appear to have completely forgotten two ancient Roman maxims that I first heard of when a boy at school: <i>Inter army silent leges,</i>and<i>Salus populi suprema lex.</i> These two maxims have stood the test of hundreds of wars and of two thousand years of time, and will continue to be acted upon so long as human nature remains what it is. They knock the bottom out of the whole of the Declaration, of several of the Conventions that have been recently ratified, of the theory&#x2014;the cruel theory that private property at sea ought to be considered more
<col>398</col>
sacred than human life, and that it can be made so by Treaties. We have had distinct warning that Germany if hard pushed will treat this Declaration of London and the Conventions as a mere collection of pious opinions. For Baron Marshall von Bieberstein at the meeting of October 9, 1907, when discussing the question of automatic mines, distinctly stated&#x2014;
<quote>"Les actes militaires ne sont pas r&#x00E9;gis uniquement par les stipulations du droit international."</quote>
This straightforward and honest statement on the part of Germany shows that she, at any rate, will act on the principles laid down by the two Roman maxims that I have quoted, regardless of so-called international law.<lb/>
I gathered from the answer by the Lord President of the Council that the Board of Admiralty had given an opinion to the effect that the establishment of an International Court of Appeal and of the Declaration of London would have hut a small and inconsiderable effect in the conduct of naval operations. Well, I have found that many naval officers hold similar opinions, but the reason why they hold them is that they believe that the Declaration of London will be flung into the sea directly hostilities commence, and that it will count for nothing in a life-and-death struggle between any two first-class Powers. If we keep up a strong Navy they think that all these deliberations and discussions between men who have studied law, but have neglected the study of war, will count for little. They consider that all the tangles in the Declaration caused by dubious wording will be eventually cut by the sword. Although I share this belief, I am still of opinion that the Declaration increases our chances of getting into difficulties with neutrals, and therefore that it would be better not to ratify it.<lb/>
The Declaration of London might, perhaps, be treated with respect if war broke out between two small sea Powers like Greece and Turkey, whose ships would fight under the shadow of superior fleets; but no two first-class Powers would allow this Declaration to interfere with their prospects of success in a life-and-death struggle. Even if they pretended to act in accordance with it, they would make important reservations. Should we ever sit down and starve if we could bring food to Great Britain by tearing a sheet of paper
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0225"/>
<col>399</col>
to pieces? A belligerent is sure to justify his breaches of the Treaty by accusing his enemy of some technical breakage. I should like to have an answer to this question before the Treaty is ratified: If belligerent A disregards the Declaration, and, in consequence, obtains a considerable advantage over belligerent B, is the latter justified in disregarding it also as regards C and other neutrals? I am afraid that the answer would be that it is one of the numerous uncertainties of the Treaty.<lb/>
International lawyers have done a great deal of mischief by taking upon themselves to interfere with the strategy and tactics of our naval campaigns. Before they even know who our adversaries are to be, or on what seas the conflict is to be waged, they have drawn up a series of Conventions, of which there will be but little left after they have been put to the test of war. Article 3, Chapter 2, of Convention 11, says that fishing boats and small vessels engaged in local trade are to be exempt from capture. This is a matter which may be safely left to the humanity and discretion of the naval officers in command. But the Convention goes on to say that&#x2014;
<quote>"The contracting Powers bind themselves not to take advantage of the harmless character of these vessels in order to use them for military purposes while preserving their peaceful appearance."</quote>
I can only say that if any of our Admirals relies on this paragraph to protect his ships he deserves to lose both his life and his fleet. It would in many cases be his duty to warn off all such vessels from the neighbourhood of his fleet under pain of instant destruction or capture.<lb/>
In the olden days, when no cutter or lugger dared to approach a brig, when no brig dared go near a frigate, when no unsupported frigate ever voluntarily came within reach of the guns of a line-of-battle ship, such a Convention might have been workable. But nowadays weapons and tactics have changed. A vessel with the appearance of a fishing smack or local trader can sink a super-Dreadnought with her crew of 800 men on board. It will be found impossible to respect this Convention. Recollect that the North Sea is very foggy. Is not the case of our own seamen more worthy of sympathy than that of the enemy's fishermen? Recollect that those same seamen will be doing their utmost to save the country from starvation, and
<col>400</col>
difficulties should not be thrown in their way by people who are foolish enough to think that they possess a monopoly of humanity.<lb/>
Article 23 of Convention 13 allows prizes to enter neutral ports and to remain there pending the decision of the Prize Courts, so that any captured British ships, whether we ate at war or not, may be taken, say, to a South American port, and left there until judicial proceedings are ovt:r, which may last two years or more, instead of having to run the gauntlet of our numerous cruisers on her way to one of her own ports. This destroys all our chances of recapturing our own ships. I understand that Great Britain has reserved her assent to this Article, and I hope she will never give it. It renders nugatory all the advantages that we have hitherto derived front the possession of harbours in all parts of the globe. Convention No. 11, in Article 1, declares that postal correspondence, whether belonging to an enemy or a neutral, whether found on board a neutral or enemy ship, is inviolable, and is to be forwarded by the captor with the least possible delay. Imagine Nelson capturing despatches front Napoleon to Villeneuve and sending them on to him unopened "with the least possible delay" in his fastest frigate&#x0021; Had he lived now, he would have been expected to do so. But I taller that he would have made use of his blind eye on such an occasion. History is full of stories of intercepted despatches and of the use made of them. Novels and plays have been written on the subject. But the exigencies of war as regards England were not sufficiently considered in this Convention by any but Continental Powers, who, being weak at sea but powerful on land, left their power to make use of such intercepted letters unimpaired when captured on land.<lb/>
International lawyers have undertaken the impossible task of laying down rigid rules for warfare on an element that is restlessness personified. But sea tactics change every day, as fast as fresh inventions are made. Naval battles have seldom occurred in mid-ocean, and their tactics have in consequence, been affected by the neighbouring coasts, whether they be hostile or friendly, tideless or not, of easy or difficult access. Yet the Declaration ignores these matters. We should not put our trust in Dreadnoughts alone. The country
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0226"/>
<col>401</col>
that has the best system of mine laying and mine sweeping may be the winners in the next war. At the Conference Great Britain endeavoured to make automatic mines illegal, but Germany refused to comply with her wishes. In the case of war the North Sea will he full of mines. Some of them will break adrift. There is a Convention that they are to become automatically harmless if they break adrift, but that does not affect them if they drag their anchors, and the mechanism for rendering them harmless may not work. No neutral will know by whose mine his ship has been sunk. The two belligerents will accuse one another of carelessness. With the North Sea full of mines prudent shipowners will make use of our Western ports, and a considerable number of our East Coast fishermen will be sweeping for mines instead of catching fish. "Night defence" is as yet an unsolved problem on which the last word has not yet been spoken. Experiments with search lights and guns are constantly being carried out by our fleets for the sake of getting more practical experience. It is common-sense that a fleet must protect itself. Generals do not allow people into I heir camps without permission. The cruising ground of a fleet is its camp and we ought not to sign away in time of peace rights that we must exercise in time of war.<lb/>
In time of war we shall have to exercise territorial rights far beyond the three-mile limit. If we wish to keep our fleets afloat we must put all neutral ships near our coasts under the same regulations that we shall lay down for our own, and enforce those rules under the penalty of seizure or destruction. We can never allow mines to be laid down or torpedoes to be discharged near our fleets by vessels disguised as neutrals. I am aware that correspondence is going on with regard to the twelve-mile limit that Russia is endeavouring to make in certain places. That is a peace question and though I believe we are quite right in opposing it because it opens up such immense possibilities, we must remember that it is a mere question of protection of fisheries at present.<lb/>
Many naval men appear to think that if our Navy is sufficiently strong the Declaration is of no importance as it is sure to be put into the waste-paper basket by any powerful belligerent. I hold a different opinion, for if we reassert rights that we have
<col>402</col>
signed away, we are far more likely to embroil ourselves with neutrals than if we merely continue to act on rights that are in accordance with what has hitherto been the custom of the sea. In dealing with neutrals we shall have an arguable case, but if we ratify the Treaty we shall have no case at all. I agree with Lord Desart in thinking that we are not strong enough to insist on all the maritime rights that we possessed a century ago. If we have the misfortune to become belligerents, we must do all we can to avoid quarrels with neutrals; and we are more likely to succeed in doing this if, at the commencement of a war, we issue our own rules, declaring unless circumstances change, we shall not assert any maritime rights as against neutrals in certain seas, and only Such rights as are absolutely necessary to our own safety in other parts of the world, thus leaving ourselves free to reassert such rights in more distant seas if the theatre of war changed. Who would have thought that questions of neutrality would have arisen in Madagascar or Nossi B&#x00E9; until the Russian Fleet reached those islands? Our seamen's hands should not be so tied as to make it impossible for them to save their country from famine.<lb/>
Two naval men were appointed to assist Lord Desart and on account of that' it has been assumed that they were in support. of the Declaration. But what did the delegates say themselves in their letter to time Foreign Secretary dated March 1, 1909? They divested themselves of all responsibility. They said&#x2014;
<quote>"To what extent the rules themselves safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of (heat Britain &#x2026; are questions which we must leave to the judgment of His Majesty's Government."</quote>
From the above passage I gather that they had instructions to come to an agreement somehow, and that any agreement would be considered better than no agreement. These two naval officers simply obeyed orders, as they had been accustomed to do during the whole of their lives. They were apparently not appointed to give their opinions. Article 69 declares that this Treaty is to continue in force until twelve years after ratification. By that time new inventions will have completely altered modern strategy and tactics. Out-of-date and retrograde as this Treaty is now, what will it be in twelve years? Surface men-of-war may have disappeared from the ocean and their places taken by mechanical inventions that no man can
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0227"/>
<col>403</col>
foresee. One year's denunciation ought to be sufficient. Recollect that we are playing with fire. If we fail to hold the sea our people will starve and we shall be obliged to submit to any conditions of peace. No amount of heroism can save us. Other nations would only be annoyed by a partial blockade, but we should be completely destroyed.<lb/>
In the Foreign Office reply to the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, sent to them in November last, it is stated&#x2014;
<quote>"Instances have occurred in recent years in which a powerful belligerent has, with the approval of the other Great Powers, declared food supplies to be absolute contraband, and such instances may, under present conditions, occur again at any moment in time of war."</quote>
Now, I take it that any nation that wishes to starve us will always claim the right to do so if it can, and that it will treat the whole of Great Britain as a beleaguered fortress, and assert that under the Declaration of London all ports in our islands should be considered as bases for our armed forces. Bristol has been mentioned as being a place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy. I do not know much about the situation of Bristol now, because it is many years since I was there. I know there was a Naval Volunteer Corps there some years ago, and I think it may be found that there is one now. if that is the case, and people under the orders of the War Office or the Admiralty are settled or quartered there, that would make it a "base for the armed forces of the enemy." If the United States were to ratify this Treaty it would give away its right to import food into this country as a neutral, whereas at present it is in a position to assert its right to do so if it chooses.<lb/>
By not mentioning the subject, this Declaration, when considered with the Preamble of Convention 7, gives tacit permission to our enemy to convert merchant ships into men-of-war when on the high seas. Its right to do so when in its own harbours is, of course, unquestioned. But, strange to say, neither document says a word about their reconversion into merchant ships. Are enemies' ships to be allowed to capture or destroy our merchant ships when three miles from a neutral coast, and then to enter that neutral's harbours as peaceful traders, fill up with coal, and to hoist a man-of-war flag an
<col>404</col>
hour after leaving harbour? As they will claim that they are not war-ships they could stop in a neutral harbour for more than 24 hours and repair themselves thoroughly before sallying out again. All that such ships want is speed and an officer holding a temporary commission, who may never have served in a man-of-war and who may belong to a neutral nation, but whose name will be put on and off an enemy's Navy List as necessary. Any light, obsolete gun can stop or sink an unarmed merchant ship.<lb/>
As it is claimed that, whether we agree to it or not, merchant ships will be converted into men-of-war when on the high seas, I think it worth while to point out that in a recent dispute with Russia on this matter we got our own way, and that the Russian converted cruisers went to one of their own ports in the Baltic to qualify as<i>bona fide</i>men-of-war. In the American Civil War a large proportion of the blockading fleets consisted of converted merchant ships. Towards the end of the war the fast, lightly-built blockade runners, when captured, were armed with guns, turned into blockaders, and officered by men belonging to the Northern Volunteer Navy. When at war with Spain, the United States made considerable use of fast merchant steamers which were temporarily armed. Our commerce has much more to fear from armed merchant ships than from the few cruisers whose names appear in foreign Navy Lists. In addition to our fleets in the North Sea we require a sufficiency of cruisers to chase these armed merchant ships. Foxes do not stop to eat chickens when the hounds are after them. Formerly privateers had to send in their prizes for adjudication. The privateer of the future is to be his own Prize Court. Privateering is said to have been abolished, but what is a convertible volunteer fleet but a privateer fleet under another name?<lb/>
I would almost as soon hear of a lost battle as of the ratification of this Treaty. It gives away the results of many campaigns, both on land and at sea, without granting us any equivalent advantages. One of the chief faults of the Treaty from a British point of view is that it appears to have been drawn up by men who, from perpetual reading of Prize Court records, had got their minds obsessed by ideas of single ship capture only, to the exclusion of stoppage of trade, which is the real
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0228"/>
<col>405</col>
object of maritime war, and which is most complete when no ships are seized at all bin; are laid up in harbour, because their capture is almost certain if they venture out to sea. The supporters of this Declaration consider that it adds an International Prize Court to the existing Prize Courts. On the contrary, the practical effect of Article 49 is to abolish Prize Courts. This piratical Article says that every officer in command of an armed ship becomes a Prize Court in himself. He is a Court of First Instance, with power to burn, sink, and destroy any neutral ship carrying food to England. Small ships cannot spare prize crews. The actual interpretation of the Declaration will rest with the naval officers of the enemy. Yet British naval officers will not have similar powers over neutral ships carrying food to an enemy Power on the Continent, because the food will be disembarked on neutral territory, within easy reach of that enemy's frontier. It is a one-sided Treaty, suited for a Continental Power with neutral harbours close to it, but unsuited for an island whose frontiers are all on the sea. The victorious belligerent, whose success limy perhaps have been due to his having disregarded the Declaration of London, might put a clause in the Treaty of Peace, making the vanquished nation liable to all the pecuniary damages that would otherwise have to be paid by the successful country, and then the possible decisions of the International Court would have no further influence.<lb/>
Another point appears to have been forgotten, which is that at the conclusion of the war one of die belligerents may have become bankrupt, or refuse to pay.<i>Ou it n'y a rien, le roi perd ses droits</i>, or one of the belligerents may have ceased to exist, as was the case when the American Civil War came to an end. The reunited States then claimed all the property in neutral hands that had belonged to the Southern States, but declined to pay off any of their liabilities. Article 9, Section 2, says&#x2014;
<quote>"The geographical limits of the coastline under blockade must be announced."</quote>
But the distance from the coast within which blockading rights may be exercised is not mentioned. This remains unsettled and is likely to be much disputed. Article 17 says that&#x2014;
<quote>"Neutral vessels may not be captured fur breach of blockade except within the area of the operations of the war-ships detailed to render the blockade effective."</quote>
<col>406</col>
This is delightfully vague. Our blockading ships would be stationed anywhere between the Shetlands and the Scilly Islands, or even Finisterre. But would the International Prize Court admit of our declaring our own limits of blockade? Or would the distance be anywhere within the radius that a blockader could steam without replenishing fuel? Would not the blockader summon other ships to join in the chase by wireless.? According to Article 20 it appears to depend on the amount of coal a blockader may have in her bunkers. Article 18 says&#x2014;
<quote>"The blockading forces must not bar access to neutral ports or coasts."</quote>
This is entirely in favour of Continental countries, where belligerent and neutral coasts may touch. Islands do not get a chance. Article 32 says&#x2014;
<quote>"Where a vessel is carrying absolute contraband her papers are conclusive proof as to the voyage on which she is engaged, unless she is found clearly out of the course indicated by her papers."</quote>
Ships' papers in war time do not give reliable evidence. During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars most slips carried two sets of papers, one to show to French officials, the other to show to British cruisers. Many of the Northern ships had British as well as American papers during the Civil War. There is also such a thing as "carrying truck," which means shipping cargo without entering it on the ships' papers. It used to be done on badly-managed lines, officers or petty officers receiving tips for cheating their owners.<lb/>
As the effect of Articles 33 and 34 has been thoroughly explained by Lord Desborough and the Earl of Selborne I shall not say much about them. Article 33 declares conditional contraband liable to capture if it is destined for the use of a Government Department of the enemy State. But the words in French, the only binding language of the Treaty, are, <i>ou des Administrations de l'Etat ennemi</i>, which would include county and parish councils, water boards, poor-law authorities, and co-operative stores, because they supply regimental canteens and officers' messes. If it had been intended to exclude these and similar bodies words to that effect ought to have been added to this clause. Article 34 also declares goods liable to capture if consigned to a trader established in the enemy's
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0229"/>
<col>407</col>
country, or <i>une place fortify&#x00E9;e ennemie, ou d'une autre place servant de base aux forces arm&#x00E9;es ennemies.</i> Why, all England is the base on which our armies and fleets depend, and our whole country becomes a beleaguered fortress, depending on her supplies of food from other countries the moment that war breaks out. Besides, most of our mercantile ports have some slight fortifications to protect their entrances. Article 46 provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"A neutral vessel will be condemned and in a general way receive the same treatment as would be applicable to her if she were an enemy merchant vessel. if," [says section 4] "she is exclusively engaged at the time either in the transport of enemy troops or in the transmission of intelligence in the interest of the enemy."</quote>
As regards "exclusively engaged in the transport of enemy troops," how can you prove "exclusively"? It would be sufficient to have half-a-dozen passengers on board to disprove "exclusively." Then, again, "exclusively engaged in the transmission of intelligence in the interest of the enemy." How do you prove that? She has only to pretend to catch fish to make herself immune from capture. Article 48 says that a neutral prize must be taken into port to determine the validity of her capture, but Article 49 says that she may be destroyed if the observance of Article 48 would interfere with the success of a war-ship's operations. It would be very seldom that a prize could be sent in. Large crews are required nowadays&#x2014;a crew for the upper deck and one for the stokehold. In the olden days they had very few men, and by never setting too much sail three or four men could manage to handle a very big sailing ship and bring her in if there was no hurry, but nowadays it is different.<lb/>
The Foreign Office reply to the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce in November last stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"at the present moment neutral merchant ships are in practice liable to be sunk unconditionally by a belligerent man-of-war."</quote>
I am aware that in the Russo-Japanese war four British vessels were destroyed by the Russians without being taken before a Prize Court, but is that a sufficient reason for altering the law? If a few burglaries had taken place without its being possible to arrest the criminals, would that be a sufficient reason for legalising burglary? By the capture and destruction of the "Knight Commander" the Russians gained their object for a
<col>408</col>
while. By destroying one ship they frightened and postponed the sailing of other vessels loaded with railway iron, and, by so doing, delayed the construction of Japanese military railways in Manchuria. These matters are not merely questions of &#x00A3;<i>s. d.</i> to be settled some years later by a Court partly composed of mulatto judges, who wish to sit for ever on a salary of eight guineas a day. The effect of the capture of a ship often has an immediate result. What can the subsequent decisions of an International Prize Court matter to a people half of whom have been starved to death by such captures? It will not bring the dead back to life.<lb/>
Article 55 renders invalid the transfer of an enemy ship to a neutral flag after hostilities have commenced. I may mention as a matter of history that during the American Civil War hundreds of Northern ships were transferred to the neutral flag of Great Britain, who made no profit out of the transaction. They remained under American ownership with American captains and American crews. There was nothing British about them except the flag. Articles 61 and 62 make a hard-and-fast rule that the presence of a neutral commissioned officer on board a neutral war-ship protects a whole fleet of neutral merchant ships. There are cases, perhaps, where it ought to do so, but if made into a fixed and unalterable rule I think it far more likely to drag us into a war with a neutral than to keep us out of it. The belligerent should make his own rules at the commencement of a war, and it would not be wise of him to make them too hard on a neutral, unless absolutely necessary, and then only in certain seas.<lb/>
Then as to the tribunal. While guns are being fired I do not believe in its being possible to form an impartial international tribunal. You must go to some other planet if you wish to find an impartial tribunal in time of war. When a fight is on, all nations sympathise more or less with one side or the other. Could we have trusted the impartiality of the Belgian Courts that acquitted Major Lothaire and Sipido? Or German judges during the Boer War? When I first saw the list of countries that were to provide judges I thought that I had got hold of a rough draft of a comic opera, and when Lord Desborough read the list of them the House laughed. I have dealt with this question from
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0230"/>
<col>409</col>
the belligerent point of view only, because the losses that we may incur as neutrals are mere trifles compared with the risk of total destruction that might happen to us in war if our food supply is interrupted. How small were our losses in the Russo-Japanese war compared with what our losses and expenses would have amounted to had we waged war with either, even if we had been successful?<lb/>
A pamphlet by Mr. Bray has been much praised by some of the supporters of the Declaration. At page 25 he says that the case of a neutral ship being inside a blockaded port and attempting to come out and succeeding in eluding the watchfulness of the blockading fleet is exceedingly remote. Had Mr. Bray visited Havana, Bermuda, or Nassau during the Civil War in America, or even if he had ever read a naval history of that war, he would never have written that paragraph. Besides, the reason why ships are more often captured when going in than when going out is that egress is a much easier operation. You wait for a rainy or a foggy night and then slip out and find yourself 120 or 150 miles off by daylight, whereas to come into a harbour you have to hit the mouth of it exactly on a dark night in thick weather. If you fail, you have to steam along the coast and then you are very likely to be caught by the blockading squadron. Many blockade-runners were wrecked on attempting to enter the Confederate harbours. It was the dangerous part of the business. At page 60, as regards Articles 49 and 50, Mr. Bray assumes that as all persons on board a neutral ship must be placed in safety before she is destroyed, the presence of another neutral ship to which they can be transferred is a practical<i>sine qua non</i>Had those who drew up the Declaration meant this they ought to have stated it clearly. Any captor would consider his own ship a place of safety for the present. Whether she would continue to be so two hours later is another matter. The Russians took some of the crew of the British vessels that they sank to Vladivostock with them. Mr. Bray may have studied a large number of Prize Court cases, but he has evidently never studied war, and therefore his opinions on the Declaration cannot be considered of much value.<lb/>
The Lord Chancellor said that one of the chief reasons why this Declaration was needed was to lessen the uncertainty of
<col>410</col>
shipowners in war-time. There can be no more certainty in war than there is about the winner of a horse race. Shipowners might as well ask for the moon as ask for certainty. The unexpected is bound to occur. Already the interpretation of nearly every article in the Declaration is in dispute. The important question as to whether the lengthy Report that accompanies the Declaration has any legal value or not is a matter on which two of our most distinguished international professors, Messrs. Holland and Westlake, hold contradictory opinions, arid they have both of them many supporters. The fact is that international lawyers have attempted an impossible task, and have failed. Had they studied war as much as they had studied law they would have known that they were attempting an impossibility. Their failure is not as conspicuous now in time of peace as it will be in time of war.<lb/>
To conclude, while giving full weight to the objections made to the Declaration by others, my chief objection to it is that if we act in accordance with it our inability to deal with real neutrals will leave us at the mercy of sham neutrals in the North Sea, who will be able to lay mines and use torpedoes in such a manner as to destroy our best ships before they have a chance of meeting the enemy's battleships. Recollect that the Japanese lost two of their first-class battleships in one day, and that the Russian flagship was blown to pieces by a mine which exploded under her magazine. Her best Admiral, Makaroff, and the greater part of her crew perished with her. Are we to increase our chances of similar misfortunes happening to us by ratifying this Treaty? If we ratify this Treaty and then disregard it, as we positively must, we shall greatly increase our chances of quarrelling with neutrals, the one thing we must try to avoid if engaged in war. If we have the misfortune to be engaged in war we must trust to our own strength on sea and on land, and to a diplomacy based not so much on former belligerent rights as on tact and common sense, to bring us with safety through our troubles.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00989"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WEARDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the noble Lord will excuse me if I do not deal at any great length with his speech. In the early part of his oration he made the remarkable declaration that, in the event of war, the bottom would
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0231"/>
<col>411</col>
immediately be knocked out of the Declaration of London. Consequently I am bound to say I can see no useful purpose in discussing his comments upon the provisions of the Declaration, because in his view it is mere waste paper. But I am very glad that the noble Lord has spoken, for he represents a class of opinion that has not been fully represented in the course of this discussion.<lb/>
This debate upon a subject of the gravest international importance has remained upon a level worthy of a great question, and I desire to bear tribute to the excellent speech of Lord Desborough, who gave expression to the views of a considerable section of the mercantile community with great moderation, prudence, and reserve. But I think it must be admitted that outside this House, and for a long period of time, there has been going on another kind of agitation. I read in the<i>Morniny</i>Post of December 3 that the Declaration of London was "a sword for the Unionist Party"&#x2014;that is to say, it was to be used as a Party weapon in connection with matters which ought to be, and I hope will remain, above all Party considerations. That is not all. In going through the streets of London your Lordships will have seen upon the walls a most reprehensible picture which is based upon an entirely incorrect view of the Declaration, and which, I regret to say, bears upon it the authority of a Member of Parliament&#x2014;Sir William Bull.<lb/>
And, in addition to that, we have the very vehement protestations of the Imperial Maritime League, which has issued a very lengthy pamphlet with regard to which I should like to make one or two comments. This is what the twin founders and twin honorary secretaries of the Imperial Maritime League say in the course of a discussion&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. Balfour should be called upon definitely to state. on behalf of the Unionist Party, that, if they are signed by the present Government, they kill be denounced by the Unionist party the moment they return to power, and that along with that denouncement of the Declaration of London there shall be by the Unionist Party a denouncement alike of the Declaration of Paris of 1856"</quote>
That is merely to adopt the attitude taken up by so capable a gentleman as Mr. Gibson Bowles. He has always been an opponent of all kinds of restrictions on naval warfare. He, as a bold buccaneer both in Parliament and on the ocean,
<col>412</col>
prefers a condition of free piracy upon the high seas; and in regard to that I was rather amused to hear the noble and learned Earl the ex-Lord Chancellor go back to the days of his boisterous youth and express preference for a condition of warfare of that character, because he seemed to quite concur with the views of Mr. Gibson Bowles.<lb/>
But what I would desire to point out is that this Declaration is opposed on two grounds diametrically opposed to one another. In the first place it is denounced by the noble Lord opposite and his friends from what I may call the naval standpoint, although the remarkable contributions from Sir Cyprian Bridge, an Admiral of the highest distinction, shows that it is by no means the unanimous view of the Navy. Then there is the opposite view that by this Declaration we are doing some grievous injury to the rights of neutrals. If I thought for one moment, and I am sure the feeling is shared by every one who considers this question, that we by ratifying the Declaration were doing, or likely in the smallest degree to do, any injury whatever to the great interests of this country, I would not raise my voice and I do not think a voice would be raised in favour of that ratification. It is because we conscientiously believe that, in the first place, as was shown so ably by Lord Desart last night and by the admirable contribution of the Lord Chancellor to-day, the rights of belligerents are carefully preserved, and that, in the second place, the position of neutrals is considerably improved, that we hold the view that the ratification of the Declaration will be for the general advantage of all classes of the community.<lb/>
I do not intend at this late hour and after the excellent speeches we have heard to labour this point at any detail. I will merely say that it is obvious that the laws respecting blockade have now been more accurately defined than ever they were before. I do not think there is any question as to that. The law affecting contraband has also been more clearly stated, inasmuch as we have now three distinct categories approved by all the Powers who were parties to the Declaration. And, above all&#x2014;and I think this is a matter of the utmost advantage&#x2014;we have set up a neutral Appeal Court. There is a great deal of talk outside this House,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0232"/>
<col>413</col>
though I admit there has not been so much inside this House, about the lamentable situation that will be created by committing the interests of our country to a foreign Court. But what happens to-day? lf our vessels when neutrals are seized in time of war by a foreign nation, is the matter adjudged by our Courts? Not at all. It is adjudged and finally decided in the Court of the captor. The setting up of a neutral Appeal Court is of immense advantage in the interests of neutrals, inasmuch as it gives them an appeal to an -authority outside the area of conflict. And when people sneer at neutral Appeal Courts I would have them remember that this country in the course of the last ten years has owed much to neutral Courts. It was in consequence of successful appeals to a neutral Court that the Dogger Bank incident was settled without a conflict, although that contingency was a very near one, between ourselves and the Russian Empire. And more recently the great controversies that surrounded the Newfoundland fisheries, which have baffled diplomatists for over seventy years, were settled by a neutral Court presided over by a very distinguished Austrian jurist. Our experience of neutral Courts ought to render us most thankful to have an International Prize Court called into existence.<lb/>
I wish to say one or two words in connection with what was said by the ex-Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, in answer to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. He called attention to the fact. in which he corroborated what Lord Deshorough stated, that in the Report of M. Renault it is said that the Prize Court is to make the law. But surely that must be taken in connection with the general situation. Now what is the general situation set up by the Declaration? In the first place the International Prize Court is to be guided by the ordinary principles of international law, and in the second place it is to be guided, and, of course, can only be guided, by the stipulations in the Declaration itself; and on points which may give rise to doubt it is to be governed by justice and equity. In the sense that it is to be guided by justice and equity it doubtless will, in a way, make law. The International Prize Court will, in the future, although I hope that circumstances will make it increasingly unnecessary, make precedents and make law; and we can only rejoice that there will gradually
<col>414</col>
be set up a recognised code of international law instead of the chaotic conditions which exist at the present moment.<lb/>
It is quite unnecessary, after what has been said, that I should go into the provisions of the Declaration in any detail, but I would point out that the Declaration of London is but a sequel to the work of the Hague Conference. Since the beginning of the present century there has been set up a system&#x2014;I think a very hopeful system&#x2014;of international Conferences which I believe in the future is going to be of the greatest advantage to the civilised world. In consequence of the decisions of the Hague Conference we have been brought nearer to many Powers with whom we had causes of estrangement, notably with America, in which case, I am very glad to say, causes of irritation and constant difficulty have been finally removed. It will be remembered that in connection with the last Conference at the Hague, when the question of the Prize Court was examined, it was urged on behalf of Great Britain that before such a Court could be set up it was desirable to establish certain general principles upon which the Court should act. Surely that was a very wise provision to be made on the part of the Foreign Office, and it was upon that foundation that the Conference of London took place and the Declaration of London was drawn up.<lb/>
Certain members of this House now call upon us to repudiate this Declaration. We are to say that practically the whole of the course taken by us in the matter has been a mistake. We are to tell the Powers whom we invited to this Conference that we refuse to agree to, and that we withdraw from, the Agreement that we proposed to them to formulate in association with ourselves. What would be our position in the eyes of civilised nations if Great Britain, having initiated this matter on grounds which I think were perfectly right and proper, were now at the eleventh hour to withdraw? If this Declaration is examined fairly and temperately, as I agree it has been examined in many quarters of this House, it will be found that the balance of advantage is enormously in favour of Great Britain both as a belligerent and also as a neutral. I am one of those who look forward to this Declaration of London and the International Prize Court as leading to something
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0233"/>
<col>415</col>
more. I look forward to the day, which, I think, will not be very far distant, when we shall be able to make some progress towards the total abolition of the right of capture and establish the immunity of private property at sea, to which this is an absolutely necessary preliminary step. It is in that direction that the trading and commercial community of this country should set their eyes; it is to that task they ought to brace their energies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-00990"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords I am sure that every one of your Lordships will agree with the noble Lord opposite that not a single member of this House would support the Declaration of London for a moment if he thought that by so doing he might inflict the smallest damage or detriment to the interests of this country. And I am sure we would also agree with him as to the great advantages this country has derived from referring to arbitration matters that might have led to disputes and wars. But surely there is very little in common between referring matters in dispute and which might lead to war to arbitration and the matter which is before your Lordships to-night&#x2014;the ratification of a Declaration dealing with the rights of belligerents and neutrals during a war and the setting up of an International Prize Court of Appeal. I agree with the noble Lord opposite that a good deal of intemperate language has been used and written on this subject. After all, what the Government are now asked to do is to remove this question altogether from the possibilities of heated argument by appointing a Royal Commission of Inquiry to go into the whole matter dispassionately and quietly, and report as to what, in their opinion, the effect of the Declaration upon this country would be in the unfortunate event of war, whether as a neutral or as a belligerent.<lb/>
I listened, as I am sure we all did, with the greatest attention to the admirable speech of Lord Desart, and to the equally admirable speech of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. The Lord Chancellor, always persuasive, almost persuaded me, but on this occasion lie did not absolutely persuade me; nor did Lord Desart, and chiefly because neither the Lord Chancellor nor Lord Desart appeared to me to attach any importance whatever to what seems to me the enormous difference between assenting and dissenting. The
<col>416</col>
speech of Lord Desart was, to a large extent, apologetic. He said the Declaration of London and the institution of an International Prize Court would he of considerable advantage to us as a neutral, and he thought there would be very little detriment to us as a belligerent. He argued that in any case we could be no worse off than we are now, but he attached no importance whatever, nor did the Lord Chancellor, to the enormous influence that a strong and determined neutral can exercise. Surely there is an immense difference between the position of independence we were in before and the position we shall occupy if we assent to the various Articles, some of which have been signed and ratified in many of these Conventions, but some of which have not been signed and are not yet ratified. To a certain extent we have tied our hands, and the question is whether in doing so we gain advantage or suffer disadvantage. The Lord Chancellor is of opinion that all that a neutral can do is to diplomatically expostulate, and, if that fails, to resort to war. But surely between the two extremes of a declaration of war and a mere polite diplomatic Note there is an enormous opportunity for a strong and powerful and determined neutral to make its view heard and felt and respected.<lb/>
There is only one point that I really wish to allude to for a moment, although it has been very fully discussed already, and that is the question of conditional contraband. The Lord Chancellor has told us that in his opinion food and the other articles of conditional contraband could certainly be brought into this country if we were a belligerent. He said they could be brought into many ports in the United Kingdom, and he mentioned one&#x2014;Bristol. If the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack was the Commander of a hostile fleet I would be perfectly satisfied. I do not mean that to be in any sense derogatory to his Lordship's capacity as a naval commander, but I would be perfectly satisfied that he would construe these Articles in a just manner, and that at any rate, though they might not be favourable to us, he would be just. But, of course, he would not be in that position, and it seems to be self-evident and scarcely worth arguing that the commander of a hostile ship, whether German, French, Russian, or whatever he might be, in the strain and stress of war would not only think it per-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0234"/>
<col>417</col>
missible, but would think it his absolute duty, to say that a consignment of food to any of our ports was a consignment to a port which would be used as a base of supply for a Government department, or for the military forces, or for the revictualling of the Fleet. Infallibly he would do so, and infallibly his own Government would justify him. If the International Prize Court thought otherwise we might get a small money compensation, a few thousand pounds, four or five years after the war had been finished, and it would be finished probably owing to our own starvation for want of food.<lb/>
Does it not really come to this? Food and the other articles of conditional contraband can be supplied to any Continental nation at war without any very great expense to them either by rail or water carriage through delivery at a neutral port which may be close or comparatively close to their own frontiers. But food could not be brought to any port in the United Kingdom because it would be considered by naval commanders to be contraband, and if brought into a neutral port it would have to be transmitted again by sea and run all the dangers of capture or destruction. Practically, therefore, the position established by the Declaration is this&#x2014;and I do not see how it can be denied&#x2014;that when we are at war food would be contraband so far as we are concerned; while food as far as any Continental nation at war with us is concerned would not be contraband of war. Surely that puts us at an enormous disadvantage. As to the other matters which have been decided in some of these Conventions&#x2014;I could mention a long list of them, but I do not think it necessary to do so&#x2014;I will allude to only one that has been mentioned, namely, that belligerents can take neutral ships and place them in neutral ports. That is no advantage to us. We have ports all over the world, and can take captured ships to our own ports. To be able to take captured ships to be retained in neutral ports is an enormous advantage to every other nation which is at war, for it diminishes greatly the chances of the recapture of those ships.<lb/>
Take also the question of the conversion of trade's into men-of-war at sea. We objected to that. The Lord Chancellor has told us so. But, though we objected to it, we assented. When it becomes
<col>418</col>
part and parcel of the Declaration of London we shall have agreed that it is a proper thing to do. We need not do it, but we shall be at a still greater disadvantage. We shall have declared that we consider it a proper thing that merchant ships, ordinary traders, should be converted on the high seas into warships. That is an enormous advantage to any nation that subsidises liners all over the world, while it is of very little advantage indeed to us.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-00996"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: I do not press the point. If we accept the document with this condition we cannot in future say it is an improper thing for anybody else to do this. If we do not do it ourselves we shall be at a still greater disadvantage. This Declaration sets up an International Court. I do not propose to say anything on that. The legal aspects have been dealt with so admirably by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and by Lord Halsbury that I will say nothing on that point at all. But the Declaration of London must be looked at, not only by itself, but also in connection with all the other Agreements that have been conic to, some signed and ratified, some signed and not ratified; and if that be done, I find it very difficult to understand how any reasonable man can
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0235"/>
<col>419</col>
deny that the general tendency of all the provisions is to the advantage of Powers that are weak at sea and to the disadvantage of Powers that are strong at sea, and as we are, or think we are, the most powerful nation at sea they are, taking them together, to our disadvantage.<lb/>
I do not know whether His Majesty's Government are going to grant a Royal Commission to look into tins matter. I hope they are. We know very little of what expert opinion is on the subject. The noble Viscount opposite, the Leader of the House, gave us the opinion, or rather an opinion, of the Board of Admiralty on the subject. It would, of course, be very interesting to know whether that opinion was given after the fact was accomplished or whether it had been given before any of these arrangements were agreed to. It would also be interesting to know whether that opinion was given merely on the question of setting up an International Prize Court and on the Declaration of London, or whether it was given in reference to all the Conventions. The noble Viscount told us that it would not be to the public interest to go into that matter further. Of course, I say nothing further about it. But I take the opinion that the noble Viscount gave us. He said that the opinion of the Board of Admiralty was that as things are at present the effect upon us as a belligerent of the institution of the International Prize Court and the Declaration of London would be small and inconsiderable. Well, I take it at that&#x2014;the effect would be small. But in the extremely precarious position that this country must be in in the event
<col>420</col>
of a great war, and in view of the consequences, not only to ourselves, but to all the constituent States of the Empire, is it a wise thing to take a risk, however small it may be, or to in any way diminish the powers we now have?<lb/>
We are in an extraordinary position. No other great nation is in a position to lose so much as we are. If we are unfortunately driven into a war our only means of bringing that war to a speedy and successful issue is by the use of as much economic pressure upon our enemy as will compel him to stop hostilities by harassing and destroying his commerce and trade at sea. That is our only weapon of offence, and while hostilities are going on we have to depend for our daily bread upon an enormous and almost daily supply of food. However small and inconsiderable it may be, to in any way take away from the powers we have hitherto exercised, or to diminish them, is to incur a responsibility which, I submit, ought not to have been taken by His Majesty's Government without at any rate ascertaining the views of the great Dominions upon the subject, and certainly not without acquainting Parliament, and through Parliament the country, with the details and the possibilities and the probabilities of all the arrangements that His Majesty's Government desired to enter into.</membercontribution></p>

<title>METROPOLITAN WATER BOARD (NEW<lb/>
WORKS) BILL. [H.L]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01014"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to move, pursuant to notice. "That it is desirable that the Metropolitan Water Board (New Works) Bill [H.L.] be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament." It will be necessary, I think, for me to say a few words in support of this Motion. The inquiry will have to be a large and expensive one, and it seems to those who have looked into the matter and are chiefly concerned that it would be desirable that it should be done before a Joint Committee rather than before two separate Committees for the saving of expense and time and for other reasons. There is another Bill&#x2014;the Thames Conservancy Bill&#x2014;which should probably go alongside this Bill, but that Bill originates in the other House of Parliament. There is not, so far as I know, any recent precedent for referring Bills which originate in different Houses to a Joint Committee. At any rate, it is quite clear that we in this House cannot send a Message to the other House of Parliament asking that their Bill should be referred to a Joint Committee, but I have reason to believe that if this Motion is agreed to to-night the other House, in responding to this Motion, will probably ask that their Bill should be referred to the same Committee, and then any technical difficulty that there is can be got over.<lb/>
I shall, as a matter of course, if the Motion is agreed to, give notice on a subsequent day of a Motion extending the time for depositing petitions, so that no petitioner may be put to a disadvantage by this procedure. The reason for that, as many of your Lordships know, is that sometimes opponents reserve their opposition to the second House of Parliament, and as this Bill is originating in this House some who desire to oppose may be postponing their opposition until the Bill reached the other House. To obviate that difficulty and to be perfectly fair, I shall, if this Motion is agreed to and the other House assents, ask your Lordships to extend the time of petitioning, so that any petitioner in that position should not be prejudiced. I do not propose to say more, and I certainly shall not attempt to forestall what the noble Lord will say in proposing the addition to the Motion of which he has given notice. But I may

remind the House that in all probability it will be quite unnecessary.<lb/>
I may tell your Lordships that there are sixty-four petitions against this Bill and questions affecting public and private interests will be raised from very many points of view, and that, in addition to complaints of apprehended injury to the locality directly affected contained in the petitions of practically all the public' authorities, the question of actual injury to the scenery of the River Thames&#x2014;the main point in the Amendment which my noble friend will propose&#x2014;and its amenities as a pleasure resort is expressly raised by the Thames Conservators, time Surrey County Council, the Kingston-upon-Thames Corporation, the Walton-upon-Thames District Council, and two or three parish councils, as well as by a considerable number of land owners. In the meantime I confine myself to making the Motion which is on the Paper.<lb/>
<i>Moved</i> to resolve, That it is desirable that the Metropolitan Water Board (New Works) Bill [H.L.] be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament&#x2014;<i>(The Chairman of Committees.)</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01015"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member> rose to move, as an addition to the Motion, "And that the Committee be empowered to consider the proposals of the Bill in relation to the public interests, as well as to the various interests directly affected, and to inquire and report whether any of the works proposed will seriously interfere with the scenery of the River Thames and with the interests of the public using the river as a pleasure ground, and what safeguards are necessary for the protection of such interests."</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01016">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the proposal of my noble friend the Chairman of Committees is to refer this important matter to a Joint Committee of both Houses. Consequently there will be one inquiry and not two as in the case of ordinary Private Bills. If. therefore, there is any mistake committed or any injury not sufficiently considered, there will be no opportunity of revising the matter by a second inquiry in the other House. It is on this account that I think it desirable to move the Amendment of which I have given notice, in order that there may be a full inquiry into the interests of the public
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0238"/>
<col>425</col>
as regards the River Thames in respect of the proposals contained in this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01017">Probably very few of your Lordships estimate what the real effect of this proposal of the Metropolitan Water Board is in respect of the reservoirs in the Thames Valley. The proposal is to construct no fewer than eight reservoirs near Staines and Walton. Each of these reservoirs is to be over 300 acres in area&#x2014;that is to say larger than the area of Hyde Park, including the Serpentine. These reservoirs are not to be excavated in the ground so that when full of water the water would be on a level with the adjoining ground, but they will be above the ground and surrounded by immense embankments raised to forty or fifty feet above the adjoining level and, in my view, of a most hideous character. It is possible to form some opinion of them from the reservoir which has already been constructed near Staines. It is a reservoir containing about 400 acres of water, and I think any one who visits it and sees the gigantic embankment round the reservoir will admit that it is a great eyesore to the whole district, and one which it is not desirable to repeat if possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01018">One of these eight reservoirs is to be constructed within a few yards of the River Thames at Walton, and over a distance of a third or a half a mile the huge embankments, forty feet high, of this reservoir will overtower the river, and. in our view, entirely destroy its amenities in that district. Two other reservoirs are to be constructed higher up the river at Wraysbury, and there, again, for something like a third or a. half a mile these monstrous embankments will overtower the river and destroy its amenities and the scenery of an extremely beautiful reach. I may remind the House that the River Thames has been specially dedicated to the use and enjoyment of the people of London and the people of other towns in the Valley, first by The Thames Preservation Act, 1885, and later by the Thames Conservancy Act, 1895. It is specially mentioned in both of these Acts as a place of recreation and of resort for the people of London. These are the words&#x2014;
<quote>"With the intent that the river should be preserved as a place of regulated public recreation."</quote>
It appears to me, therefore, that no interference with the amenities of the river or
<col>426</col>
with its scenery should be allowed, except after very careful and deliberate inquiry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01019">It will no doubt be represented&#x2014;in fact, already my noble friend has represented&#x2014;that the interests of the public of London in this respect will be sufficiently safeguarded by the numerous petitions which have been presented in respect of this Bill; but I am informed by those who have carefully examined the petitions that there is not one which approaches the subject from the exact point of view which I do&#x2014;namely, from the point of view of the people who use the river as a pleasure resort. There are two or three petitions which deal with the amenities of the river, but there is not one, I am told, which deals with the question from the exact point of view which I have endeavoured to present to the House&#x2014;namely, the interference with the scenery of the river and with the enjoyment of the river by those who go to it for pleasure in the manner contemplated by the Acts I have quoted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01020">There is one petition to which I think it necessary to advert&#x2014;namely, that of the Thames Conservancy. One would suppose that the Thames Conservancy would be deeply interested in preserving the amenities of the river and its scenery. In one clause of their petition they do speak of the interference of this scheme of reservoirs with the amenities of the river, and they say that the construction of the reservoirs must of necessity impair the general amenities of the riverside. But they go on to ask, not that the reservoirs shall not be constructed or that they shall be withdrawn to a distance from the river where they would not be destructive of its amenities, but that the embankments may be planted with shrubs and trees. The planting of the embankments with shrubs and trees will in no way remove the difficulties and objections I have raised. It appears to me, therefore, that there is not much to be gained out of the opposition of the Thames Conservancy; and I believe it is generally understood that the Thames Conservancy have come to an understanding with the Metropolitan Water Board, and that they raise no substantial objection in principle to the erection of these monstrous embankments close to the river. I do not know whether the Chairman of the Thames Conservancy is in his place, but, if he is, I should like to ask him whether it is not
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0239"/>
<col>427</col>
the fact that an agreement has been arrived at between the Thames Conservancy and the Metropolitan Water Board which admits in principle the construction of these monstrous reservoirs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01021">I move this Amendment in the interests of an association called the Thames Preservation League, a body which was created some few years ago. It consists mainly of representatives of other associations deeply interested in London questions, and especially in open space questions, and was formed for the purpose of resisting attacks on the River Thames in Parliament very much of this kind. It has, however, no <i>locus standi</i> to appear before the Joint Committee, nor has it any funds to fight a great Parliamentary contest. What I ask is that it may be put in such a position, through the Amendment which I propose, that the Committee may, if they think fit, call upon this body or any others to present a case on behalf of the public against these reservoirs as now proposed. I could quote many precedents for the course I propose. When I was in the House of Commons I took part in many discussions where Motions were made for Instructions to Select Committees, directing them to take into consideration the public interests in respect of Private Bills under consideration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01022">It has always seemed to me that one defect of our Private Bills Committees has been that the public interests are not sufficiently considered. The Committees have before them counsel and witnesses representing different interests, and if those interests come to an agreement the public interests may be left in the lurch. It is on this account that in many cases I have thought it expedient and wise to ask for the instructions of the House that the public interests might be duly considered and reported on by the Committees. One very important case of the kind was the Birmingham Water Bill in 1887. In connection with that Bill I moved an Instruction that the Committee should receive evidence and report upon public matters of great importance relating to a large area of land which the Birmingham Corporation proposed to take in Wales for the purposes of their scheme. The Motion was strongly opposed by Mr. Chamberlain, very much on the same grounds as those on which the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees will probably oppose this Motion. It was
<col>428</col>
opposed on the ground that the same points might be raised by other opponents to the Bill, and that the Corporation of Birmingham were sufficiently aware of the interests of the City of Birmingham, and that it was unnecessary that the interests of the public should be presented to the Committee by evidence in the manner proposed. But the House of Commons did not take this view. The House agreed to my Motion; we had the opportunity of laying evidence before the Committee; and the Committee eventually decided in our favour and inserted all the clauses which we considered desirable and necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01023">Another case of the same kind somewhat later was that of the Lochearnhead Railway. In that case it was proposed to construct a railway where it would interfere greatly with the amenities and beauties of the valley and river in that district, and we moved an Instruction to the Committee to the effect that they should take into consideration the possible effect of the Bill in destroying the scenery of the district and the amenities of the valley. There, again, the House of Commons agreed to the Instruction, and the Committee took other evidence than that presented by the ordinary petitioners. They took evidence which was presented independently by those who had no <i>locus standi</i>, and eventually decided on making various alterations in the Bill which completely met our views. It is precisely on the same ground that I ask your Lordships to pass this addition to the Motion of my noble friend, and authorise the Committee to consider other interests&#x2014;the public interests in the matter&#x2014;than those which are brought before them in the usual way.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01024">Your Lordships will see that my proposed Instruction to the Committee is less mandatory than it was in the Lochearnhead case and in the Birmingham case. It merely asks that the Committee shall have authority to make these inquiries. I do not ask that it shall be mandatory for them to do so. Therefore I venture to hope that in this moderate form your Lordships will agree to my Amendment and will give some security that the public interests in this matter shall be fully and fairly considered, so that, if possible, the evils which we believe would result from the erection of these enormous reservoirs so close to the river may be obviated. With that view I beg to move.</p>

The Board are fully alive to their duty to preserve, as far as they legally can, all the amenities of the River Thames. In fact, they have petitioned against this Bill and are at the present moment engaged in somewhat delicate and confidential negotiations with the Metropolitan Water Board in order to insure that the amenities of the river should be preserved, as far as is compatible with the proper supply of the great metropolis of London with water.</membercontribution></p>

I should like to say, before proceeding to discuss the merits of the proposal, that I hope no one will understand that, although I oppose the Amendment of the noble Lord, I am the least careless of preserving the amenities of the River Thames. On the contrary, I think, from such information as I have, that there is a great deal to be said against some of the proposals in this Bill. But some part of the remarks of the noble Lord seemed to me to go rather in the direction of Second Reading opposition&#x2014;that in no circumstances was any reservoir large enough to supply London to be constructed in that part of the Thames Valley which is available.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01032"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY </member><membercontribution>: I certainly did not go that length.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01033"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH </member><membercontribution>: That being so, I shall not proceed with what I was going to say in regard to that. The point, therefore, between us is narrowed to this. There is no doubt a case for inquiry. There is no doubt a strong presumption that those who are engaged in. the duty of supplying London with water are more concerned with getting it as cheaply as they can than with preserving the amenities of the river. Let that be common ground between us. My point is that there is no risk of the danger being incurred which the noble Lord presupposes. I leave out of the list of petitioners the Thames Conservators, because they are evidently under some suspicion. I leave out the Port of London Authority. But, besides those two important bodies, there are petitioning against the Bill no fewer than five county councils, four municipal counties, including the City of London itself, ten urban district councils, three rural district councils, three parish councils, six water companies, six railway and canal companies, and no fewer than twenty-six different landowners. That is a formidable list of petitions, and I can assure your Lordships that in at least a score of these petitions the question of the amenities of the river and the use of the river as a pleasure resort is absolutely and entirely raised. The Joint Committee will be fully competent to deal with all the large public questions which will be raised
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0241"/>
<col>431</col>
by the petitioners, and having regard to the representative character of those petitioners and the thoroughness with which I believe the provisions of the Bill will be considered by the Joint Committee in relation both to public and private interests. I venture to think that it is unnecessary to hamper the inquiry by bringing in those who have not petitioned, and who, perhaps, cannot petition.<lb/>
Your Lordships all know that the rules of <i>locus standi</i> are not so strict in this House as they are in the other House, and in the case of Joint Committees the rules of our House regulate the matter of <i>locus standi</i>. In the other House of Parliament the question of <i>locus</i> is not reserved to the Committee itself; but in the case of Joint Committees and Committees of your Lordships' House the question of <i>locus</i> is absolutely left to the Committee itself. I venture to say that, in the interests of the important body for which the noble Lord spoke, it is better for them that they should have their witnesses heard through some of these other bodies who have petitioned than that they should go before a Committee without the aid of counsel and agents and so on. It will tend to a great saving of public time that it should be so, and I cannot conceive that these important bodies who are petitioning will overlook the importance which they will add to their case by getting witnesses who can speak with the authority which attaches to those in whose interests the noble Lord has moved this Amendment. But what I do deprecate is giving a sort of general roving power to anybody to come before a Committee. After all, Committees are conducted upstairs at great expense, and if people are themselves not spending any money but simply spending their own time it is likely to tend to a great increase of expense and to a great prolongation of the inquiry, which is extremely undesirable, and no public interest would be served by it. I do not believe that these county councils or landowners will be so failing in their own interests as not to take all the evidence I they can get, and there is nothing in the procedure proposed in my Motion which will exclude the calling of any witness at the discretion of those who have a right to appear before the Joint Committee. I therefore venture to hope that, in accordance with usual precedents, the inquiry will be confined to those who have a <i>locus standi</i></membercontribution></p>

There is a great deal in the proposition of I the noble Lord which appeals to all of us. We are all concerned in maintaining the scenery of the River Thames.

<col>433</col>
this side of the House. I am bound to confess that when I first read the criticisms that appeared in the public Press I began to fear that the British delegates must have been of an extraordinarily accommodating temperament, and that the representatives of the foreign Powers had entered into some dark conspiracy to rob this country of its most cherished rights at sea while they themselves gave away nothing which they considered of value to themselves. So, my Lords, I thought I had better study the other side of the question, and, having done so, I have arrived at the conclusion that, so far from our delegates having abandoned anything that was of supreme importance to this country, they were very fairly successful in persuading the delegates of foreign Powers to compromise on many of the questions which they had hitherto regarded as of value to their own countries.<lb/>
The ignorance of the public generally on this question is astonishing, and I had an illustration of that fact only last Thursday evening when I left this House. I happened to meet a friend of mine who is at the head of a large and important mercantile house in the City of London. I told him we had been discussing the Declaration of London, and his only comment was this, "I do hope you are not going to truckle to those German fellows." I did not attempt to argue with him. I merely asked him whether he had studied the Declaration. "No, he had not had time, but he had read some of the criticisms that had appeared in the newspapers." I asked him whether he did not consider it of great value to his own firm and to firms such as his own that in future there would be a free list&#x2014;a list of articles which in no circumstances could be declared contraband of war. I pointed out to him that some of the articles named in that list were articles in which he himself was interested, and that they included one or two which were not only susceptible of use in time of war but were absolutely essential to the conduct of warlike operations on any large scale. He admitted that he had never heard of the free list, and that it undoubtedly would be of very great advantage. Here, my Lords, was a man who had formed his opinion entirely from the criticisms he had seen in the public Press. Those criticisms have been to a large extent misleading, and they have also been mutually destructive.<lb/>
<col>434</col>
There is one class of critics who starts by advocating the denunciation of the Declaration of Paris in order that this country may revert to the tactics which it pursued 100 years or more ago. They then proceed to assert that the Articles of the Declaration of London governing conditional contraband are of such a nature that in time of war this country must inevitably be starved into surrender. Apparently these critics would like food and the other articles in the list of conditional contraband free when they are consigned to this country and absolute contraband when consigned to any other country&#x2014;a delightful arrangement for us, no doubt, but one to which I am afraid no foreign Power is likely to, agree. But I wonder whether this class of critics have considered what is likely to, be the result of our returning to the tactics of 100 years ago. I wonder whether they contemplate with anything like equanimity the prospect of this country being engaged in War with, perhaps, half the civilised world, because that might very probably be the result of our returning to the tactics we adopted 100 years ago. For my reply I go to the critics themselves, and I find that they tell me that we are not only incapable of effectually cutting off the supplies of the enemy, that we are not only incapable of waging war against half the civilised world, but that we are trot even capable of defending our own supplies.<lb/>
Let me illustrate those points by one or two short quotations from the pamphlet issued by the Imperial Maritime League, which has run through eight editions and for which it is claimed that it has been distributed throughout the entirety of the constituencies of the United Kingdom. I turn to page 13 to see what they have to say about the Declaration of Paris, and I find this&#x2014;
<quote>"But how do we expect, to enforce our national will, how do we hope to win victory in war, unless we retain the means to injure our opponents? And now that we have abandoned&#x2014;it is to be hoped temporarily only&#x2014;the right of capturing enemy goods in neutral ships, the power of injuring seriously any great State with which we may come into conflict is practically gone."</quote>
Then, on page 17, this is what they have to say about. our food supply&#x2014;
<quote>"By actually consenting to this inclusion of food amongst articles of contraband, our representatives at the Loudon Conference have put a weapon in the hands of our rivals which cannot fail. If this astounding provision be ratified by the Government, they will have put the coffin lid on England and nailed it down."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0243"/>
<col>435</col>
Finally I would like to give a quotation from what they say in regard to our capacity for defending supplies&#x2014;
<quote>The broad fact cannot be denied that British shipping, all the world over, is at the mercy of its foes."</quote>
These are the people who want to denounce the Declaration of Paris. Again&#x2014;
<quote>"We have now seen, in all its appalling tenuity, the weakness of the force upon which, wrapped in ignorance as in a garment, the British public blindly rely for their salvation from the last sorrows of starvation in time of war."</quote>
There is a pretty medley, my Lords! And that is the food with which the public mind has been fed very largely during the last few months. I think that those who so violently denounce this Declaration may be divided. roughly, into two classes. "There are the Jingoes, who apparently are prepared to challenge the rest of the world to come on, and there are the pessimists, who fear that we are no longer capable of defending our own supplies. I cannot help thinking that between these two mutually destructive attitudes the Declaration of London may very likely approach somewhere near to the happy medium.<lb/>
Then we are told that by this Declaration we have abandoned the doctrine of continuous voyage so far as conditional contraband is concerned&#x2014;I think the noble Earl, Lord Desart, called it the doctrine of ultimate destination. Well, I am very glad we have abandoned it&#x2014;it was absolutely useless as a weapon of offence&#x2014;and I think it will very likely give us facilities for obtaining supplies through neutral ports. The noble Lord, Lord Desborough, in the course of his speech the other evening, told us that we must not suppose that it would be possible to obtain supplies through a neutral port, because none of the ports of northern France, for instance, had any facilities for handling cargoes of grain. Well, who wants to handle cargoes of grain? All that it is necessary to do is to turn the ship round and send her across the Channel. Noble Lords laugh, but I do not know of any objection to that. Other objectors say that grain is very frequently shipped in part cargoes, and that therefore it would be absolutely necessary to handle the cargoes and trans-ship them on arrival at the neutral port. All I can say is that in time of war the grain must be shipped in full cargoes. It may be more expensive and more inconvenient, but then, unfortunately,
<col>436</col>
war always is expensive and always is inconvenient. Then Lord Desborough went on to say that, even supposing it were possible to get supplies through a neutral port, they would be swept off the sea by the enemy before they could get across the Channel. If our Fleet is not capable of protecting those supplies when they are coming across the Channel, our plight must indeed be a desperate one.<lb/>
After all is said and done, does it not come to this&#x2014;that either our Fleet must be capable of guaranteeing supplies or we are lost? It is no use talking about feeding this country with supplies in neutral ships. It is a physical impossibility. Either our Fleet must be capable of protecting our own shipping or we must surrender. I do not think I can do better, in leaving this branch of the subject, than by quoting an extract from "Sea Law and Sea Power," by that protagonist in the agitation against this Declaration, Mr. Gibson Bowles&#x2014;
<quote>"Even if Great Britain be not so predominant"&#x2014;i.e., in command of the sea&#x2014;"even then, so wide and so open are the avenues of access to the British Islands, such supplies cannot be intercepted to any appreciable extent were all the navies in the world to be set the task."</quote>
The question of the destruction of neutral prizes before adjudication is intimately bound up with that of contraband. And we are told that this country, under the Declaration, has abandoned the attitude which it has hitherto consistently maintained&#x2014;that in no circumstances should a neutral vessel be destroyed before adjudication. This country has been almost singular in its attitude, and surely rather than allow the matter to remain in its present unsettled state it was better that our delegates should endeavour to persuade the representatives of the foreign Powers to agree to some compromise which approached as nearly as possible to what I may call our ideal. That they did succeed in doing that I think is shown by the fact that the delegates of the foreign Powers protested that the restrictions under which in future the destruction of neutral prizes before adjudication is to be allowed were of such a nature that they amounted almost to a renunciation of the right. Let me remind the House of what the noble Earl, Lord Desart, says in reference to this in his Report [p. 98]&#x2014;
<quote>"The delegates representing those Powers which have been most determined in vindicating the right to destroy neutral prizes declared that the combination
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0244"/>
<col>437</col>
of the rules now adopted respecting destruction and liability of the ship practically amounted in itself to a renunciation of the right in all but a few cases. We did not conceal the fact that this was exactly the object at which we aimed."</quote>
If the Declaration is not ratified, what is the position? Presumably the other Powers will still maintain the right to destroy before adjudication. If we are belligerents we cannot protest more strongly than by prosecuting the war in which we are already engaged. We cannot hope for any support in our protests from the other neutrals, because they reserve to themselves the right of destruction before adjudication.<lb/>
Well, then, what is the position if we are neutrals? I have heard it suggested in the course of this debate that in some hazy and unexplained way we could bring pressure to bear upon the belligerent. I do not quite know what particular kind of pressure it is. And here, again, it must be remembered that we cannot expect support in bringing that pressure from any other neutral, every other neutral, with possibly one or two exceptions, reserving to themselves the right to destroy before adjudication. I cannot think of any other remedy but the remedy of war, and that is the remedy which apparently some of the critics would wish us to employ. Let me put this to them. Supposing both belligerents destroyed some of our shipping, We being neutrals, are we to go to war with both of them? Supposing there are three belligerents and each one of the three destroys some of our shipping, are we to go to war with all three belligerents? I go to time critics themselves again for the reply. They tell me that, so far from our being able to carry on war against three other Powers, the strength of our Fleet falls far short of the two-Power standard. Then we are told that the restrictions under which in future the destruction of neutral prizes would be allowed are so uncertain that the commander of a belligerent warship would undoubtedly give himself the benefit of the slightest doubt, and would destroy the ship in order to strike a blow at the enemy by stopping some of his supplies. Well, if he will do that in spite of the restrictions contained in the Declaration, what would he do if he was unfettered by any restrictions whatever?<lb/>
The criticism of this Declaration has been so sweeping that apparently those who condemn it cannot even see any value in
<col>438</col>
the list of articles which cannot he declared contraband. They tell us that they are of minor importance, and that, with possibly one or two exceptions, the list includes articles which no Power would ever dream of declaring contraband. Apart from the fact that the goods named in that list account for an enormous proportion of the total foreign trade of this country; apart from the fact; that the list includes one or two articles which have on previous occasions been declared contraband&#x2014;apart from those facts the list also contains articles which I of my own knowledge know to be not only susceptible of use by belligerents, but essential for the conduct of warlike operations. I should have thought it would have been generally acknowledged that it was of great advantage to this country, both as belligerents and as neutrals. As belligerents I should have thought it was of advantage to know that in future there is no risk of our having to close down our factories for lack of raw material; and as neutrals I should have thought it was a great advantage to this country, with our enormous interests, mercantile and shipping, to know that in future any article named in the list can be sent to any part of the world without let or hindrance, with the certain knowledge that it cannot be declared contraband. I should have thought, too, that it would have been generally acknowledged that it was an advantage to have in future one uniform law instead of the present state of uncertainty; and further, I should have thought that it would have been generally admitted, after our recent experiences at time Hague, that we are not the only country in the world that is capable of dispensing justice. But, my Lords, apparently the same fears that have allowed the critics of this Declaration to think that the delegates of the foreign Powers at the recent Conference entered into some dark conspiracy to rob this country of its most cherished rights, lead them to suppose now that the representatives of the other Powers when they come to the International Court will throw every other consideration to the winds, every consideration of honour, of justice, and fair play, in order that they may wreak their spite upon this country. I prefer to think that we are not, after all, so utterly detestable in the eyes of every other nation in the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01039"><member>LORD MUSKERRY </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, last Thursday my noble friend Lord Ellen
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0245"/>
<col>439</col>
borough made an admirable speech on this subject from the point of view of the naval officer. I wish to say a few words on behalf of the merchant service, and more especially on behalf of the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, which comprises very nearly two-thirds of the certificated captains and officers in the merchant service. International lawyers may have a most perfect knowledge of international law and of other law, but they cannot be considered as practical men in regard to seafaring matters. The men whom I represent are&#x2014;no men more so&#x2014;and on their behalf I protest against the ratification of the Declaration of London. They say that the Declaration of Paris was bad, but that this new Declaration will be worse as regards the interests of the merchant service.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships that this country mainly owes its prosperity to the merchant service, and we owe to that service the building up of this great Empire. Therefore anything which will tend to deteriorate or do away with our merchant service should be severely condemned. If you do away with our merchant service you may then do away with the defending Army. and Navy, for this country will have nothing left worth defending. On Thursday last the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack maintained the carrying of food supplies in neutral ships. We do not want our food supplies carried in neutral ships as long as we can have our own ships. It is in our own ships, commanded and manned by British officers and seamen, that we should put our trust. The merchant service, if the Government do their duty and give it the support it deserves and needs, will always be amply sufficient to supply this country with food. In the old days the merchant service always did its duty, and if looked after now it will be ready to do so again in the same way.<lb/>
In conclusion, I would like to draw your Lordships' attention to a reply given by Mr. Asquith in another place on February 9. The right hon. gentleman was asked by Mr. Butcher&#x2014;
<quote>"Will any opportunity be given to Parliament to express their view&#x2014;Yes or No&#x2014;whether the Declaration should be ratified?"</quote>
The Prime Minister replied&#x2014;
<quote>"The ratification is a matter not for Parliament but for the Crown. The Crown will not be advised to ratify if the House of Commons gives an adverse vote."</quote>
<col>440</col>
It seems to me that the question is whether, if the House of Commons gives it approval and your Lordships disapprove, the Cabinet will consider that sufficient to advise the Crown to ratify the Declaration&#x2014;in other words, is it the intention of the Government that in matters of this sort the House of Commons alone should constitute Parliament and that the opinion of this House should be completely ignored? I hope some noble Lord opposite who will speak for His Majesty's Government will be able to give us definite information on this rather important subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01040"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the third day on which your Lordships have been engaged in discussing this most important subject. I do not think that the country will be surprised that so much time has been given to this Declaration. It indeed deals with matters which are of vital concern. I think that in the speech which my noble friend Lord Ritchie delivered this afternoon he did not give as much appreciation to the vital character of this Declaration as it deserves. I am not a pessimist and I am not a Jingo, but really politicians, even Unionists, in this country are not entirely confined to. those two classes. Some of us claim to be men who desire to study the vital interests of our country in moderate language and with a moderate policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01041"><member>LORD RITCHIE </member><membercontribution>: I said that those who violently denounce this Declaration could be divided into those two classes. I am quite sure the noble Marquess does not intend to violently denounce the Declaration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01042"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: My noble friend was, of course, addressing himself to the debate which has taken place in your Lordships' House during these three days, and I have not heard a violent speech delivered on either side of the House. I desired, therefore, to call attention to the fact that the criticisms which we offer to the Declaration are not violent criticisms, but are criticisms which are important, we think, because of the vital character of the Declaration itself. A noble Lord opposite, Lord Weardale, who spoke on the last occasion, drew a very gloomy picture of the results if the Crown were advised to refuse the ratification of this Treaty. No doubt it is a strong measure to take. But when you
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0246"/>
<col>441</col>
come to consider that our country stands in a unique position in regard to this matter, and when you also add to that the great novelty of the procedure which the Declaration and Convention are about to set up, then. I think ay refusal of the ratification would be abundantly justified.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Ritchie said that unless we were able to protect our own shipping we were certainly lost. We shall protect our own shipping, no doubt, a great deal of it; but we cannot be ubiquitous. Powerful though we are at sea, we cannot cover absolutely all the avenues of trade of this country. And let him remember also that when we come to discuss with other countries what ought to be done in matters of this kind we stand to lose far more than any other country. Every other country practically has a land frontier over which all the supplies they require call be brought. We alone have to bring our supplies across the sea. To us alone it is a matter of life and death that the regulations which govern that commerce should not be unfavourable to this country either in peace or in war. If am sure the Government appreciate the importance of that consideration, but I think they have underrated the difficulty.<lb/>
What are the Government trying to do? Their object is, if I may say so, admirable. They are pursuing a policy which has been adopted by both Parties in the State&#x2014;that is to say, they are endeavouring to establish, as far as possible, in lieu of the arbitrament of arms in international disputes, a reign of law. Both Parties in the State have aided step by step to build up this edifice. But we have got very little way yet. And when you are establishing a Code of International Law which has to be interpreted judicially by a tribunal, is it not abundantly clear that you must be in the highest degree careful of the precise language you employ and the precise terms on which you agree? There is nothing precise at all in this Declaration. It is vague from beginning to end. The vital interests of our country are to be subject to a vague Code which may or may not be interpretated in our favour. When I read the language of this Declaration I am reminded far more of the language of diplomacy than the language of an Act of Parliament. The noble Viscount (Viscount Morley) dissents. I was going to say an impertinent thing&#x2014;namely, that the noble
<col>442</col>
Viscount does not know the language of diplomacy as well as some of us, but that would not be true. He knows that in the language of diplomacy the last thing people desire is to be precise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01043"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: Some people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01044"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: I do not know in what particular Treaties the noble Viscount has been engaged. All I can say is that nearly all the Treaties in which I have been engaged abound in loopholes. The language is never precise. Nor does it matter in ordinary cases because the authority which is going to decide the meaning is the Power itself. It is well known as an axiom of diplomacy that the Power itself which signs the Treaty decides its obligations under the Treaty. Therefore vagueness does not matter. But in a Code which is going to be interpreted by a. tribunal it is quite another thing, and we require the language to be precise. Let me give an example. I am sorry the Lord Chancellor is not in his place. In his speech the other night the noble and learned Lord said that one of the main objects to be obtained by this Declaration is certainty. There is no certainty, as far as I can make out, in any of the provisions of the Declaration. There is a word <i>comer<ob/>ant</i>&#x2014;that is the French word used to describe the person to whom if foodstuffs are consigned in certain cases they may be destroyed. It is of vital importance, of course, who the <i>comer<ob/>ant</i> is. The Foreign Office have translated that as "contractor." Everybody knows that that is wrong. Yet this was the solemn translation which our Foreign Office put upon the word. What is the proper translation? The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, throwing over the Foreign Office, used the phrase "trader" when he described it. Why should there be such a doubt upon the matter? Of course, if it were a Bill such as your Lordships are accustomed to deal with there would be a definition clause, but the language used in this instrument is absolutely vague.<lb/>
But a far worse criticism remains behind. The question is, Does or does not this Declaration contain within itself the sum total of our obligations? There is great doubt about it. There is the question whether or not the text of the Declaration is conclusive, or whether we have not got
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0247"/>
<col>443</col>
to look beyond the text of the Declaration to a certain Report which is issued in the Blue Book along with it, and which appears to have some sort of authority&#x2014;it is called the Renault Report. I want your Lordships to realise that the Renault Report does not coincide with the text. I am not merely giving my own opinion, for I hold in my hand a most instructive account of a debate on this Declaration which took place at a conference of the International Law Society&#x2014;apparently a very learned authority&#x2014;in August last year. Several speeches were made at that conference which well deserve your Lordships' attention. Here is an extract from a speech by Sir John Macdonell, who, speaking of this Report, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The commentary seems occasionally to extend or qualify if not to conflict with the text."</quote>
Your Lordships will see that, if that is true, it is of vital importance to know what authority this commentary has. It is surprising to find that in the text itself there is no reference to the commentary. That attracted the attention of a noble Lord opposite, Lord Reay, when he spoke on Thursday night. He said that it surprised him, and he thought there ought to have been some words in the text itself embodying the Report; but there is nothing of the kind.<lb/>
That being so, one must turn to other authorities, and I turn to the discussion at this conference to which I have referred. Mr. Arthur Cohen, a supporter of the Declaration, is evidently exceedingly doubtful whether the text is to prevail or the Report. The same in the case of Sir John Macdonell, and the same in the case of Dr. Baker, who is hon. secretary of the International Law Society; and Sir Thomas Barclay, who also spoke, had no doubt that it was not to be considered as having authority. Here are some very weighty opinions. I want His Majesty's Government to tell me whether they are right or whether they are wrong. What have we heard in your Lordships' House on the matter? We heard a speech the other night from what I may call the fountain head, a most learned speech&#x2014;your Lordships' House is the only assembly in the world which could have produced such a speech&#x2014;the speech of an expert addressing himself to a subject of which he is master. I understood from Lord Desart that, in his opinion, this Report had full authority to explain the text; and in order to reinforce
<col>444</col>
his own opinion, which by itself would have weighed very greatly with your Lordships, Lord Desart cited a certain French lawyer whom he was not able to name but who he assured us was of great eminence, and in that gentleman's opinion there was no question that this Report had full authority.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01050"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: That is the opinion of Lord Desart. What is the opinion of His Majesty's Government? We had an opinion of some sort given us by the Lord Chancellor. I should have preferred to say these things in the noble and learned Lord's presence, but as he is not here I hope lie will forgive me. I think all your Lordships who were present when the noble and learned Lord spoke must have realised that, when this Report was mentioned to the noble and learned Lord in an interruption by my noble friend Lord Desborough, the Lord Chancellor showed some surprise. He was evidently taken aback for the moment, if I may say so of so excellent a controversialist. All the resources at the noble and learned Lord's command were at once put in motion, and documents of all sorts and sizes were presently produced on the Woolsack. It was a very astonishing thing that this Report which is almost of Conventional force came as a matter of some surprise to the principal legal
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0248"/>
<col>445</col>
member of His Majesty's Government. The noble and learned Lord, having refreshed his memory upon it&#x2014;of course, he must have been to some extent familiar with the document&#x2014;was afterwards challenged by my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury, and then the Lord Chancellor said that it was an official commentary which would be regarded by any Court. That was very carefully chosen language. I have no doubt it would be "regarded." But in what respect would it be regarded? Would it be regarded as authoritative, as binding? Really I am not asking too much when I ask that, before this country is committed by His Majesty's Government to a Convention which touches its most vital interests, your Lordships and the country, and perhaps I may say the Government themselves, should realise exactly to what the country is being bound.<lb/>
I have a further reason for thinking that there is some doubt in the minds of His Majesty's Government. Among the many ambiguities in the text of the document is the meaning of the word "enemy." In the document itself it is said that where foodstuffs are destined for the use of the enemy they may be treated as contraband. So far as the text of the document is concerned "enemy" appears to include the whole population of the country which is at war, but the Report seems to limit the meaning of the word to "the armed forces of the enemy." The question is, which of these two views is to prevail? If the Report is absolutely authentic and authoritative, it is not necessary to say any more. The expression in the Report is limited to "armed forces," and the Government might leave it there. But that is not so; for, as the noble and learned Lord reminded us, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has promised in ratifying the Convention to issue a special Note stating exactly what "enemy" does mean in our opinion&#x2014;namely, the armed forces of the country, and not the people as a whole. If it is necessary for the Foreign Secretary to explain in a special Note what "enemy" means, then it is clear that the authority of M. Renault's Report is not complete; otherwise it would not be necessary to make any explanation at all. Further than that, this concession by the Foreign Secretary is of the greatest importance, for if it be necessary to explain one of the words in
<col>446</col>
regard to which there is a difference between the text and the Report., it obviously follows that all the ambiguities ought to be explained, and if they are not explained the Court must take notice of the fact that only one point on which there has been a difference has been dealt with by a special Note.<lb/>
The inevitable conclusion I come to is that the Government have not made up their minds what is the authority of M. Renault's Report&#x2014;whether it is to have Conventional force, as the noble Earl, Lord Desart, told us just now, or whether it is merely, in the Lord Chancellor's words&#x2014;and I am glad the noble and learned Lord is now in his place&#x2014;to be regarded by the Court, though in what respect it was to be regarded he was not good enough to tell us. This is not a mere theoretical point. I want to call your Lordships' attention in a very few words to the additions which the Report involves beyond the text of the Convention. In the first place, there is the question as to whether this International Court is to have the power of making law. That is a matter which was put to the Lord Chancellor on Thursday. The Report, so I understand&#x2014;I take it from my noble friend&#x2014;says that this International Court will have the power of making law. The Lord Chancellor when challenged on that point was very munch shocked, and I am not surprised, considering his great position and judicial training, that he should have been shocked, at the suggestion that this Court should absolutely have authority to make law. But, my Lords, if the Report is to be believed, if it is of Conventional force, then, although the Lord Chancellor is shocked, the fact remains.<lb/>
Then we turn to Article 35. There your Lordships will see that in determining the destination of a ship the ship's papers are to be treated as conclusive, with a certain limited exception. How does the Report deal with this? These are the remarkable words of the Report&#x2014;
<quote>"It must not be too literally interpreted, for that would make all frauds easy."</quote>
How is a Court. going to interpret this very precise provision if M. Renault's authoritative Report says that this particular provision must not be taken too literally, for otherwise frauds would be easy? Is that the kind of Code of law, is that the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0249"/>
<col>447</col>
kind of precision, the kind of certainty, of which the noble and learned Lord is so proud? When you come to look into this Convention will it not be found that these provisions are not precise, that they are not certain, and that they are not such as the noble and learned Lord himself would pass in a Bill submitted to your Lordships' House?<lb/>
I next come to the word "base." The noble and learned Lord will remember that this point was raised during the discussion On Thursday. The term used in the text of the Convention is "a base for the armed forces of the enemy." The importance of the matter is this, that where foodstuffs are being taken to a base for the armed forces of the enemy they may be treated as contraband. The text says "a base for the armed forces of the enemy," but the Report goes much further than that. The Report explains this word "base" to include base for supply. It is quite specific and quite clear. The noble and learned Lord was faced with that difficulty. He was told by my noble friend Lord Desborough that there was this distinction, but he did not attempt to explain the ambiguity or the divergence, and the fact remains that with regard to this vital matter&#x2014;namely, the ports which will be open for the supply of corn and foodstuffs to this country in its last extremity&#x2014;the Government do not know what they are committing themselves to. I quote against the noble and learned Lord the noble Earl, Lord Desart, his Plenipotentiary. The noble Earl says the Report is almost of Conventional force. 'The noble and learned Lord referred to the Report and apparently treated it as of very little value; and the difference between the two texts in a matter of this land, which is a matter of life and death to our country, is to remain in this vague state when the ratification of His Majesty is granted to the Convention.<lb/>
I turn for a moment from the uncertainty of this Report to some of the effects of its provisions. Through this fog of uncertainty we seem to discern the sinister outline of future disaster to our country. The first criticism which I venture to make of the terms of this Report is that they differ essentially from the terms which His Majesty's Government desired should be agreed to by the Powers. If your Lordships will study the Instructions which Sir
<col>448</col>
Edward Grey gave to the Plenipotentiaries you will find that they differ in most vital respects from the terms which were ultimately agreed upon. Sir Edward Grey was not for conceding that there should be this vagueness as to where foodstuffs might be consigned in time of war. On the contrary he laid it down in express terms that foodstuffs should not be treated as contraband unless they were destined to a beleaguered fortress, and in other respects he was equally precise. He said that the sinking of neutral prizes could in no case be admitted as possible or allowed. In both these respects the Convention differs from the views put forward by the Secretary of State. That is my first. criticism. My second criticism is that the very nature of this Convention involves this consequence, that however harshly an enemy might interpret the terms of the Convention all redress is postponed till after the war is concluded. That was the principal argument put forward. by my noble friend Lord Selborne in his speech the other night, and the Lord Chancellor, who followed him on that occasion&#x2014;it is a remarkable fact&#x2014;never touched the point at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01051"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR </member><membercontribution>: I did not agree with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01052"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord did not agree with him, I am sure, but in his speech he did not deal with the point. That was a very remarkable omission and a very remarkable circumstance, because it was much the strongest point in my noble friend's speech. Now, what is the effect of this postponement taken in connection with the ambiguities to which I have already drawn your Lordships' attention? What will inevitably be the attitude of the foreign Power, or rather of the commanding officer of the enemy's ship? He will say, if there is a shadow of doubt as to the applicability of the clauses of the Convention, "Let us treat the foodstuffs as contraband; let us sink the neutral ship. The matter, no doubt, will have to be decided hereafter, but that will be after the war is over. It is a matter of quite secondary importance how it is decided then; it may be that I shall turn out to be wrong, but if we are victorious in the war I am quite certain that will not be held to my disadvantage." It is very probable that in future wars, after this Convention becomes international law, one of the ordinary conditions of peace will be
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0250"/>
<col>449</col>
that the beaten party pays all the fines which the International Court will impose; and, therefore, this commanding officer's action, unless, of course, defeat ensued, would not matter to him or to his country. If England were defeated she would have to pay the costs of the very outrage which had so much assisted towards her defeat. The Lord Chancellor himself was quite aware of this point. He applied it, of course, to England, and he thought it was rather in favour of the Convention. He said that if, in the course of our operations as belligerents we were challenged as to the right of doing any of these things in the Convention, we should have an opportunity of saying that we preferred to go before the International Court. Exactly, but so will our enemies have the opportunity of saying that, and the result is that all redress will be postponed until afterwards.<lb/>
My Lords, just think what this will mean. I am not so confident of the power of my country as is my noble friend Lord Ritchie. Powerful as we are, and magnificent as our Fleet undoubtedly is, any one who looks round on Europe to-day must; see that the contest on winch we may be engaged with Powers growing in strength every day in respect of their fleets would be of the most arduous kind, and although I do not doubt that we should fight our hardest we are not entitled to take any chances. We have to protect the whole of our immense seaboard, and unless we can protect it, according to my noble friend Lord Ritchie, the country must starve. My noble friend Lord Selborne put this point to your Lordships, but as the noble and learned Lord has not dealt with it the House will forgive me for shortly putting it again. As matters stand without the Convention, if there was an attempt on the part of an enemy to capture or destroy as contraband all ships carrying foodstuffs to our ports, there would be an uprising on the part of neutral Powers at once. It is absurd to think that the neutral Powers would allow an enemy to do what he liked with neutral shipping as matters stand at present, even if our enemy was so disposed. As a matter of fact a belligerent would be effectively controlled by the public opinion of the neutral Powers. The noble and learned Lord alluded on Thursday to a certain amount of friction between us and Germany at the time of the South African War. That is perfectly true, but the noble and learned Lord knows quite well that the
<col>450</col>
protests of the German Government had immense weight with the British Government at that moment. The protest of the neutral Tower that we were interpreting international law harshly&#x2014;I am not going into the merits of the case&#x2014;was most effective, and had to be taken account of.<lb/>
If this Convention is not passed do you mean to tell us that if a belligerent interpreted his powers harshly and treated as contraband of war the cargoes of all neutral ships carrying foodstuffs, wherever they were destined among the ports of our country, that would be submitted to by neutral Powers? I am certain it would not; and the certainty that it would not be submitted to would be an effectual check on the belligerent. But if this Convention passes the neutral Power itself would be a signatory to it and would be bound by it; and what would happen would be; this, that when an enemy began destroying or capturing ships carrying foodstuffs to our country on the ground that they were going to bases of supply, the enemy would reply to a protest by saying, "It is all right. You can go to the tribunal after the war is over and get compensation. You must not take the law into your own hands and say that you can determine what a ' base of supply ' is; that is a matter for the tribunal hereafter." And so they would merrily go on capturing ships carrying foodstuffs, not caring a jot or a tittle what happened before the tribunal afterwards, because if they were victorious they would not have to pay compensation. My Lords, that is a point which the noble and learned Lord did not touch upon in his speech, and it is a point which we would ask the noble Viscount to address himself to. We ask him to tell us how the Government defend this ambiguity in the light of the difference which it creates, and why redress should not be available; at the moment instead of being postponed until the end of the war.<lb/>
I do not intend to detain your Lordships any longer this evening. I have done my best to summarise the arguments which have emerged from our side of the House during this three days' discussion, and I want to conclude, if I may, by an appeal to His Majesty's Government. I do not think it is a matter of surprise that the Convention containing as it does all these ambiguities and provisions full of menace to the future, has been received with great disfavour by some of our large Dominions over the seas.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0251"/>
<col>451</col>
I do not know it on my own authority, but I have heard it stated in the course of the debate, and I believe it is so, that that is certainly the case with regard to one of our great Dominions, and I understand that before the ratifications are exchanged His Majesty's Government are willing that the matter should be discussed. I am glad to hear that. But it is not only our Overseas Dominions who are protesting against this Convention. The Chambers of Commerce in this country are also protesting against it. I do not think the Government will say that the opinions of the Chambers of Commerce are to be despised. Why should they be despised? They are vitally interested. These are matters to which their attention is being continually drawn and matters which would mean a great profit or a great loss to them hereafter. The Chambers of Commerce have nearly all discussed this point, and thirty of them, including the Central Chamber of Commerce, have passed a Resolution adverse to the Convention. Then take the Chambers of Shipping. I do not think that any member of the Government will say that they are to be despised. Out of ten Chambers of Shipping all except one have passed hostile Resolutions, and I believe that that single one, which was quoted the other night, is beginning to reconsider its favourable view of the Convention.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, in the face of this adverse opinion, what is it we ask the Government? We do not approach them in a hostile spirit. We do not say to the Government, "Tear up your Convention," but we do say, "Before you take this perfectly irretraceable step, of committing this country without the possibility of going back for twelve years, will you have an inquiry into the precise meaning and the exact effect of the provisions to which you propose to commit us?" That is, may I say, a most reasonable request, and I earnestly hope that His Majesty's Government will either grant the request, or will, at any rate, not shut the door to the possibility. My authority is, of course, of no value; but after listening to the debate I have ventured to put before your Lordships some reasons for thinking that the Government really have riot appreciated what the effect of the Convention is, that they do not quite know its meaning, and that they have not reflected upon the dangers which it conceals. "In those circumstances I earnestly hope, if
<col>452</col>
they do not consent to my noble friend's Motion to-night, that they will at any rate keep an open mind on this point, and before the ratification is finally exchanged submit this Convention to a careful inquiry by a body competent to deal with it.</membercontribution></p>

The House may congratulate itself, as the noble Marquess has implied, upon these three days of discussion. It has been my fortune to listen to many thousands of debates, but I have never listened to a debate in which the temper&#x2014;if I may say so without presumption&#x2014;was more serious, from which Party spirit was In. re excluded, and in which the gravity of the arguments and the full statements of the various views were more excellently sustained and established.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ritchie, who resumed the debate to-day, said that what astonished him was the ignorance of many persons outside as to the important points which are being raised in this Declaration. I am quite aware of the prevalence of that ignorance and that laxity of language and of mind. But then I am lenient, and the case, after all, is a very complex one. I believe my noble friend Lord Desart himself will agree that you do not pick up all the threads of this enormous web without a really serious and rather troublesome exercise of mind. Why is it complex? It is complex because it concerns our rights as a belligerent, it concerns our rights as a neutral, it concerns the rights of other Powers both as belligerents and as neutrals, and you have to be constantly studying the Papers and the proposals in the Declaration now under discussion, to be constantly changing your angles of vision and putting yourself in different places and taking up new points of view. The noble Marquess said he was afraid perhaps I might bring to this discussion the spirit of the diplomatist rather than that of the lawyer, and then he
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0252"/>
<col>453</col>
said that, possibly, I was not so practised a diplomatist as some other persons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01054"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: I withdrew that. I did not mean to be in the least uncivil to my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01055"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I am quite sure of that. We ought not to look at this Declaration merely as diplomatists; still less merely as lawyers, not even entirely from the point of view of Lord Musketry, who said this Declaration was going to do away with the merchant shipping service of this country. It filled me with horror when I heard his words. If that were so, I should not get up in this House and defend the Declaration. I think that is a delusion on Lord Muskerry's part. The Declaration, of course, is more or less in the nature of a diplomatic transaction; it is a set of international arrangements, as I shall show a little later on.<lb/>
Perhaps I had better deal at once with the points which the noble Marquess has put, and first I will deal with the simplest. I am diplomatic enough for that. He quarrels with the Declaration because the word "enemy" is a too vague word. Does it mean enemy Government, or does it mean enemy population, or what does it mean? Report or no Report, it is perfectly clear that, looking at Article 34 and reading it&#x2014;as it must be read&#x2014;in conjunction with Article 33, the expression "enemy" can only mean enemy Government. At all events, that is the intention with which it figures in the Declaration. Then he complained that it was too vague and not precise enough. There, again, we are not construing an Act of Parliament; we are not really construing or deliberating upon a Code, properly so called. It is a Code which must be capable, from the nature of the subject-matter concerned in it, of more or less elasticity and adaptation, not in principle but in application.<lb/>
Now with regard to the Report, which the noble Marquess dwelt upon at great length, as many other critics of the Declaration have done, he seemed to suppose that no language is to be found in any of the books or any of the papers bearing upon the point, concerning the relations of the Report to the Articles in the Declaration. There is a very important passage which has been brought to my notice in the Report itself. It is on page 35 of the Blue Book on the Conference in London. What does it say? It reads.&#x2014;
<col>454</col>
<quote>"We now reach the explanation of the Declaration itself, on which we shall try, be summarising the reports already approved by the Conference, to give an exact and uncontroversial commentary; this, when it has become an official commentary by receiving the approval of the Conference, may serve as a guide to the different authorities&#x2014;administrative, military, and judicial&#x2014;who may be called upon to apply it."</quote>

The question is whether they are going to ratify the Report as well as the Convention. If it is only the Convention, there is nothing in the Convention embodying the Report.

It would be much more to the point if he read out a phrase in the Convention which referred to the Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01057"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I would like to real some words quoted the other night by my noble friend Lord Desart. This is language as to the Report by a high, competent, and first-hand authority. He says&#x2014;

The intention, as we believe, of the signatories to the Convention was to adopt it as an approved commentary. I cannot carry it beyond that point. I think the Report is placed there as an approved commentary; and it is quite true, if the noble and learned Lord opposite insists on our regarding the Declaration as if it were an Act of Parliament to be applied by an International Court, that in applying the principles and details of this Declaration the International Court, if they are puzzled at anything in it, will look at this explanatory commentary.</membercontribution></p>

<col>455</col>
Report on the Declaration, my noble friend Lord Desborough has criticised the Prize Court Convention on the strength of a passage in the Report of the second Peace Conference of 1907 on that Convention. The passage occurs in that part of the Report which commented upon Article 7. In virrue of that Article the International Court is, in the absence of Conventional stipulations binding upon the parties and of generally recognised principles of international law, to give judgment in accordance with the general principles of justice and equity. It is to such a judgment that the Report refers when it says that the Court will be called upon to "make the law." No occasion for thus "making of the law" can, therefore, arise except in cases not governed by any generally recognised rule of international law. When the Prize Court Convention was signed in 1907 and the Report on it made, there was a wide field of prize law in which the practice of nations was so divergent that no rules could be said to be generally accepted. It was for this reason that His Majesty's Government refused to accept the Prize Court Convention unless and until definite rules concerning the law of prize had been agreed upon. This has been effectively done by the Declaration, and the ratification of the Declaration will have the effect of practically eliminating, except in some few instances, all those cases in which, otherwise, the International Prize Court would have been called upon, in the words of the Report, to "make the law." I turn to another point. The noble Marquess pointed out, as many critics outside have done, the difference between the instructions given to the British delegates by Sir Edward Grey when he appointed them and what was afterwards acceded to. Let us look and see what were the instructions. The Foreign Office often gives instructions to Ambassadors and delegates; and if you are carrying on complex negotiations you do not say to your Ambassador, "What we want is so and so; unless you get that we will take nothing." Sir Edward Grey in his instructions neither said it, nor could he have intended it, and to argue, as the noble Marquess does, that because we could not get all that we sought, therefore we ought not to take what we could get is surely very defective logic. The noble Marquess, taking up a point raised the other night by the noble Earl, Lord Dun-raven, used language which, accustomed as I have been to revolutionary language in
<col>456</col>
this House during the last year or two, surprised me. It is admitted that hitherto, the law and practice of the Constitution has been that the treaty-making power rests with the Crown. That is not denied by any one. The language used by Lord Dunraven was a little more definite than that of the noble Marquess, but in either case are you not committing yourselves to a somewhat dangerous doctrine? I will explain what I mean by dangerous. There is a great State in which the treaty-making power is divided between the Executive and the Legislature, but I am not sure that those who have to deal with that great and most friendly community always find that an advantage, and I think you will be introducing a very dangerous principle or maxim into our own Constitution if you impair the treaty-making right now vested in and practised by the Crown.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01060"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: I said nothing to challenge that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01061"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I only throw that out as a <i>caveat</i>, which you may take at its own value. I should like to deal, quite rapidly, with some of the points that have been raised in this most instructive debate before I come to what I believe is the real thing that remains and deserves serious consideration&#x2014;that is, the Royal Commission. I will postpone that for the present, if I may, although I regard that which the noble Marquess wound up by pressing upon us as worthy of very serious consideration. My noble friend Lord Desborough, speaking about the free list in the Declaration, said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is nothing particular in the free list&#x2014;only cotton."</quote>
My Lords, I happen to come from the cotton county of Lancashire, and if the noble Lord were to go there and say that the free list was not worth anything because only cotton was added to it, he would be enormously surprised at the outcry he created.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01062"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH </member><membercontribution>: I did not say it was not worth anything. I said that only two new articles&#x2014;cotton and hemp&#x2014;had been declared non-contraband. I did not deny that they are important, but I said that all the others had been declared non-contraband before; and I would remind the noble Viscount that two of the most interested Chambers of Commerce in Lancashire have passed a Resolution against the Declaration.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0254"/>
<col>457</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01063"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will go and feel the pulse of Lancashire he will learn whether the people of that county think the omission or inclusion of cotton is a thing which is of no importance. Then it is urged that the enemy may not observe these new rules. They may not, but what reason is there to suppose that they would observe the old rules? Then Lord Desborough asked whether the Declaration would be binding on Great Britain whether the Prize Court was ratified or not. It would be possible to erect and constitute that Court even though you reject the Declaration, but in the opinion of His Majesty's Government as at present advised it would be an extremely inexpedient step; it would be far more expedient to combine the Declaration with the constitution of the Court as proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01064"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH </member><membercontribution>: That was not the object of my question. What I wanted to know was, supposing the International Prize Court, which has to go through both Houses of Parliament, is not set up, will these new rules of war be binding on all our national Prize Courts </membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01065"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: That requires very careful consideration, and before I could say that it would be absolutely binding it would be necessary to know what were the executive directions. Certainly no one will deny that if you reject the Declaration this year we shall have taken up a position with regard to some of the points concerned which would make it very difficult for our Prize Courts to go against it. That is my own opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01066"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE </member><membercontribution>: If the Act of Parliament does not pass does the Declaration fall to the ground?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01067"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I do not know. The noble Lord knows that all these strictly legal questions require a careful way of answering, which would not be satisfied in this case by my saying off-hand whether it would or not. It is a perfectly right question, but it has no bearing on the point as to whether we should or should not ratify the Convention. I am dealing now with the detailed and incidental points that struck me during the progress of the debate. They all, I think, made an impression on the House, and they deserve to be briefly dealt with.<lb/>
Lord Selborne blamed Mr. McKinnon Wood, the Under-Secretary of State,
<col>458</col>
because he said that the refusal of this ratification would give a new stimulus to the competition in naval armaments. Lord Selborne said that he did not believe that it would cause the Navy Estimates in any country to go up or down by a single sovereign. How would the rejection of the Declaration be regarded? Continental Powers would see the greatest naval Power in the world declining to be bound by rules of naval warfare that were not her own. That would be how they would interpret it. If that be so, I am sure that Lord Selborne will see how our action would be regarded by such bodies as Navy Leagues in the great countries of the Continent of Europe who would demand an increase in their Navies&#x2014;increase upon increase. I am sure that we should, if we found any other Power taking a similar part, demand an increase of the Navy to protect our commerce against the arbitrary construction of rules of naval warfare by a Power of overweening strength and pretensions.<lb/>
There is the point that has been made in the popular and Press discussions that the scheme of an International Prize Court was made in Germany. That is the allegation. What are the facts? The German plans were presented independently and simultaneously with our own. The proposals were not identical, as a matter of fact: We proposed an International Court and took an active part in preparing the Convention. Our Government, of course, closely watched the progress of the deliberations of the Conference. Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Austria, the United States, and most of the other States were all, so I am informed on the best authority, as active as we were in the discussions. Germany was not more active or more prominent than other Powers, especially such Powers as France and the United States. The same is true of the deliberations of the Naval Conference which negotiated the Declaration of London. Is it not rather ludicrous, my Lords, to talk of "attempts on the part of Germany and the weaker naval Powers to alter the laws of war to the detriment of Great Britain?" That, to the best of my knowledge and belief, is a pure fiction.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Weardale, mentioned the other night a certain poster a <i>propos</i> to the right of destruction. It is a picture, I understand, of a British vessel being sunk by an enemy's warship. I am
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0255"/>
<col>459</col>
the last person to be over-fastidious about posters. The honours with regard to posters are, I think, about equally divided between the two sides of the House. But let us look at this poster. What does it really mean? It can only mean two things&#x2014;that but for the Declaration neutral ships would never be destroyed, and, secondly, that it is the Declaration that confers the unlimited right to destroy. I have seen some perverse posters in my life, but I cannot imagine a more perverse poster than that one. As if a neutral ship could not be sunk now according to any rules laid clown by the commanders of the nation that claims that right. I submit this to the most doubting critic that the Declaration has to encounter, that the checks on destruction are stronger under the Declaration than they would be without it.<lb/>
The noble Marquess spoke on the subject of bases, and this requires a little more lengthened treatment. When the purpose of Article 34 is borne in mind, and when it is remembered that the object of it is only to meet cases in which it will rest on the owner of the goods to prove the innocence of the consignment, the authorities do not think it is at all likely that a Prize Court would hold a commercial port, such as abound on our coasts, like Southampton and Bristol, to be a base. It would be entirely a question of fact. The words of the Declaration are, "A port serving as a base"; that is to say, a port at the time serving as a base.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01068"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY </member><membercontribution>: Of supply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01069"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: Quite true.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01070"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount accepts, then, that the terms of what we have inaccurately called M. Renault's Report apply not only to a base of armament but to a base of supply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01071"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Certainly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01072"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The distinction is a very important one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01073"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I quite agree. What does a base of supply mean? Take a naval base&#x2014;a port that contains, gathers together, and allows egress for supplies for an enemy's ships. A vessel coming out of such a port habitually, constantly, and systematically would no doubt constitute that port a
<col>460</col>
base of supply. It has been argued, I observe, in some places that the possibility of a cargo coming to Southampton or to Bristol, and the provisions eventually reaching Aldershot, would constitute Southampton a base of supply, and the argument is that as that might apply to every other port in the country it would deprive us of access through these ports to foodstuffs and cargoes of that kind.<lb/>
Take the case at its highest. Assume that every port in the, United Kingdom would be held to be a base, and, therefore, that every neutral ship with food supplies would be a justifiable capture, because food supplies could be presumed to be contraband until their innocence was established. Even then, as was pointed out the other night, I think by Lord Desart, the importance of that question has been exaggerated, because of the seaborne food supplies of the United Kingdom 90 per cent. are carried in British ships and only 10 per cent. in neutral ships. The 90 per cent. in British ships could only be safeguarded by the action of the Navy, that is, by harrying and hunting down the enemy cruisers, and the steps taken to protect British ships would equally keep the seas open for neutral ships bearing food supplies, and there is no reason to assume any high proportion of captures of neutral ships, or that neutral ships so captured would have a material effect on the food supplies of this country. If the Declaration were not ratified, the position of neutral ships in this respect would not be better, but worse. The noble and learned Earl opposite said something about proof the other night. In this matter the present practice is that the onus of proof is always on the owners of the goods, and the judgment of the Russian Supreme Prize Court, in the case of the ship which has been referred to in this debate, during the Russo-Japanese war, and dealing with the parcels of foodstuffs in the cargo, was that in all such cases, according to the practice of Prize Courts for many centuries&#x2014;
<quote>"the onus of proof would undoubtedly lie with the individual seeking recognition of an irregular destination and the release of vessels and cargoes arrested on suspicion."</quote>
Really, the important consideration in this matter of base of supply on our own coasts is that it must be serving at the time as a base of supply and must be connected with military or naval operations.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0256"/>
<col>461</col>
Now, my Lords, I go to the proposal which is really the proposal before the House&#x2014;namely, a Royal Commission. As to that, I would make this general remark. The objections&#x2014;the point, I think, was made by Lord Reay the other night&#x2014;urged against the Declaration are really objections directed against the whole policy of entering upon any negotiations with other Powers for the settlement of questions relating, to International Law. That is what I feel, and I feel it particularly when you speak in favour of this Royal Commission. There cannot be a more fascinating and attractive vision in the world than a body of impartial and competent gentlemen sitting as a Royal Commission to decide these matters, but the chiming dream is dissipated when you look at the facts under which this Declaration comes before the country and before your Lordships' House.<lb/>
There was first the Conference at The Hague. Many things were left open at The Hague. We then invited a second Conference to be held in London expressly to deal with these questions. The whole set of questions was carefully considered by the body so constituted, the London Conference, which contained, I would remind your Lordships, representatives of the Admiralty, of the Foreign Office, as also the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence. What does this Motion which is now on the Table of your Lordships' House mean in plain English? I will venture to tell your Lordships the interpretation which will be put upon it by the persons concerned. What does it make us say to the Powers whose representatives we invited to assemble and who did assemble here? This is what I think it makes us say:&#x2014;"We invited you to come here. We asked you to thresh out in detail the matters left open at The Hague. We admire the care, the diligence, the acuteness with which you conducted your deliberations. We recognise the sincerity with which you sought to find common ground for adjusting the questions outstanding amid conflicting interests. But, gentlemen, we have so little confidence in the results of your wisdom and your toil that we propose to throw the result overboard and to set up a new body of our own to find new answers to exhausted questions." That is the view which the Powers who were parties to that Conference will take, and I would
<col>462</col>
respectfully suggest to noble Lords sitting on that Bench [the front Opposition Bench] that the day may come, some time or another, when you may have to deal in somewhat difficult circumstances with foreign Powers, and I shall be very much surprised if, in the case of their protesting against any line or any action of yours, they do not show their want of confidence in your capacity for doing business. I shall be very much surprised if the Declaration of London has not by that time become rather a by-word, and if they do not remind you of that transaction. Your Lordships may think that the Declaration is in need of, and the Declaration is open to, amendment. Does anybody suppose that this amendment would be easier to attain if, after inviting all these Powers to confer and discuss, you flung away the result? Will it make it easier on future occasions? Does anybody suppose that the rejection of this Declaration now, or the postponement of it until you have overhauled the deliberations of this extremely diligent, competent, and conscientious body, will not cause discouragement, disappointment, yes, and irritation, among the nations of the world? Human nature being what it is, I ant sure it must.<lb/>
I will not discuss to-night any question of increased armaments, but this I will venture to say. Is the fact that you recognise, that we recognise, the policy of the necessity of strong armaments any reason why you should not accompany this strengthening of your armaments by taking along with it a policy which seeks to settle international disputes by international Courts and international agreements? On the contrary, so far from it being a reason why you should not do that, it is another, it is the best reason for doing it, and if by rejecting this Declaration you show yourselves unwilling to accompany increased armaments with this, it will be the despair of civilisation. It is impossible to deny, even those who most of all object to this Declaration will not deny, the gain to the world of anything that draws the great. States of the world to enter upon and follow up a course leading to collective agreement and concert, where, formerly, there was disclosed nothing but disagreement and confusion. The Peace Conference of 1899 and that of 1907 laid the foundation, if they did no more, of an agreement on principles of international law, which before were vague and doubtful
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0257"/>
<col>463</col>
and left neutrals to the arbitrary decisions of Prize Courts. Those were instruments which laid the foundations for a better state of things.<lb/>
Nobody believes that moral influence alone will save or enable a great and powerful State to do its work unless the rulers of that State, to use a cumbrous phrase, "keep their powder dry." Nobody has argued for this Declaration upon any other principle. On the contrary, no Englishman would argue for the Declaration, or for the ratification of the Declaration, if he did not take for granted in every page and every line of that Declaration the doctrine and the policy of the supremacy of Great Britain at sea. This is no empty sentimentalism. But, though nobody in his senses believes that moral influence alone will save a State and retain its power, I am sure that nobody in his senses, nobody who has read history, who is familiar with modern diplomacy and the currents of that diplomacy, and realises the spirit which is slowly forcing its way through democracy both in Europe and elsewhere&#x2014;no one who thinks of this will deny that moral influence in itself is a valid, practical, and substantial asset which a nation ought to be proud to possess and which it would be madness to throw overboard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01074"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had no intention of speaking in this debate at all, but, having listened to practically the whole of it, I wish to make one or two observations on certain points that have been raised, not of a controversial character, and to respectfully ask your Lordships' House to press for further consideration of this Declaration. I do not ask, and I do not wish to be thought to ask, for any special mode&#x2014;it may be by reservation should this Declaration be ratified, or it may be by further consideration before it is ratified; but there are points which have come out in this debate which I respectfully urge do require further consideration.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said a moment ago that the policy which is opposed to this Declaration was a policy which objected to entering upon negotiations for the settlement of questions of international law. I will be no party to such a policy. I welcome all attempts among civilised nations for settling questions of international law, and I can give very practical reasons for so saying. I hope I may be allowed to refer to my own experience. I have had the
<col>464</col>
privilege of appearing twice for my country in great international arbitrations, and I say most emphatically that I would far sooner go before an international tribunal to argue whether a Treaty or Convention had been broken or observed than I would go to argue whether a principle of international law had been observed or broken. I can endorse what has been said in the course of this debate, that if you are dealing with a Convention or a Treaty you stand to a certain extent upon some solid foundation, whereas if you are arguing a principle of international law your foundations are very sandy, if I may use the expression, because there is always the greatest controversy as to what the principles of international law are, having regard to the different views entertained by different nations.<lb/>
I am, therefore, most anxious to do everything in my power to promote the coming to agreement between civilised nations upon such questions, but there are one or two points that have been raised in this debate, not of a controversial character, which I think are so strong and so important that they do require further consideration and reservation. I will deal with one which was referred to a few moments ago by the noble Viscount, and that is what has been called the Renault Report. The noble Viscount read from the opinion of some no doubt great authority&#x2014;I do not know who it was but an anonymous authority&#x2014;as my noble friend, if I may so call him, Lord Desart, did, that the Report will be regarded as having Conventional weight. If that is to be so, if we are going to invite that position, let us make the Report a part of the Convention. Let it be agreed one way or the other whether it should or should not be so regarded; and above all things, let the differences between the language of the Report and the language of the Declaration be solved by one or the other being adopted. I am not speaking without my book on this matter. I have had to deal with this specific question. I have had to address international tribunals upon it. I had the assistance of my noble and learned friend in one of the longest arbitrations on the subject, and I was junior to the late Lord Chief Justice in the first great one. We had to deal with this particular question as to what weight was to be given to contemporaneous documents which passed between nations at the same time as a Treaty or Convention, and it is quite impossible, if I
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0258"/>
<col>465</col>
may say so with great respect, for any international lawyer to stand up and say that a Tribunal will regard a Report of the character of M. Renault's as having a Conventional force. I say so with great deference to the noble Earl, Lord Desart, because I know his immense learning and experience in this matter. All I say is that you must not assume, for the purpose of this discussion, that the Report is going to have Conventional force. I am sure the noble Viscount will not misunderstand me when I use that as a plea for delay and further inquiry. Either there must be in connection with ratification an express reservation as to what the position of the Report is to be, or there must be an agreement that the Report is to be treated as having Conventional force. If that is going to be adopted you must have the differences between the Report and the Declaration removed; otherwise you will have the inevitable argument that there is a contradiction between the Report and the Treaty, and that one must be adopted and not the other, and then, of course, the Declaration would be said to have the greater force. I mention this subject only because I think it quite unsafe&#x2014;and I speak with a feeling of great responsibility&#x2014;to advise your Lordships or the country to accept this Declaration on the plea that the Report will be regarded as binding by some tribunal that comes to consider the matter fifteen or twenty years hence.<lb/>
There is another point that has not been answered. I listened to it with great interest when my noble friend Lord Halsbury spoke. It has been assumed in the course of this debate, and I do not deny that there is some ground for the assumption, that this Declaration will be favourable to Great Britain as long as Great Britain is a neutral. The Lord Chancellor assumed it in the course of his speech, and I do not differ from him in general principle. But the real test of that is the law that is going to be administered by the International Prize Court. As Lord Halsbury put it in the course of his speech, we ought to have some idea, at any rate, of the extent to which the recognised principles of international law are going to bind the International Prize Court before we accept the view that this part of the scheme, even from the point of view of neutrals, as quite satisfactory. It seems to be forgotten by those who investigate this subject for the first time that the prize law of the world is

really the British prize law, and that since the time of Grotius and those great men of generations ago who founded the international law all the authorities that have been created have been, practically speaking, created on the authority of British prize law. If your Lordships read Storey's Prize Law, the standard book on the subject, the book recognised between the United States and ourselves and by the world generally, and look at the authorities cited there, you will find that nine out of ten of them are the authorities of Lord Stowell awl the authorities of the English Courts. The American decisions, which are also of very great importance, were based upon the same law. Therefore it is not a vague point which Lord Halsbury put forward when he asked that some assurance might he given as to what law would be administered in this International Court of Appeal. I mention this again for the purpose of saying that there is room, so to speak, for further consideration; there is a necessity for further reservation; and therefore, without for one moment saying that it is to be in this way or in that way, it seems to me that it is a matter proper to be brought before your Lordships' House in order that there may be some further consideration of it before this Declaration is ratified.<lb/>
I pass from that in order to say a very few words upon what is, after all, the most difficult part of this case. We have been invited to deal with this Convention as a whole, and to take this and that, because as a whole it would be desirable and advantageous to us to do so. I quite agree&#x2014;and I say so most unfeignedly&#x2014;that with regard to blockade and some of the other minor parts of this Declaration the arrangements seem to me to be very good, and no serious objection can be taken to them. But when we come to Chapter 2 relating to contraband of war and Chapter 4 as to the destruction of neutral prizes, it seems to me that they call for further consideration. I recognise to the full that the labours of this Conference were largely undertaken on the invitation of this country. I recognise that there does rest upon us a moral responsibility to endorse as far as we can the labours of this Com mission. I am not going to say one single word against that feeling. But when all is said and done we must look, and it is not right to forbid us to look, at the provisions of the Declaration in order to see whether the vital interests of this country are or are not protected, and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0259"/>
<col>467</col>
in my humble opinion those two most important Chapters, Chapter 2 and Chapter 4, which deal with contraband of war and the destruction of neutral prizes, will require reservation. Before the Declaration is confirmed or otherwise the interests of the country require to be protected.<lb/>
I speak with very great deference, but this is no new subject to me. I had the honour and responsibility of advising Her late Majesty's Government when the South African War began. Up to that time this country had not been involved in any great war since the Crimean War, and&#x2014;I am telling no secrets&#x2014;all the questions with regard to contraband had to be revised at the Foreign Office. With the assistance of my distinguished friend Sir Robert Finlay I spent hours and days in considering the matter, and I hope we left it in a little better condition than we found it. I say no more than that. This subject of contraband, of conditional contraband, and of continuous voyage is not a subject that I have had to get up for the purpose of this debate. It has been burnt in upon me by hours and days of study, and therefore. I hope I shall not be considered presumptuous in venturing to say a few words to your Lordships about this. although, as I say, I had no intention of intervening in this debate at all.<lb/>
It seems to me that the noble Earl, Lord Desart, and my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor have pitched their defence in too high a key. It may be that Lord Desart spoke with the feeling of a parent&#x2014;or rather of a godfather or guardian, and it may be the feeling that this country ought to ratify this Declaration which has prevented them from adequately appreciating the fears and apprehensions that are felt by persons who have considered these Articles and whose opinion ought to be regarded. Do not let it be thought that this is a Party question. If this was a Party question I would not say one single word in reference to it. I have felt that responsibility resting on me throughout the whole of my life in your Lordships' House. But I know that fears with regard to this Convention are held as strongly by distinguished men who are supporters of His Majesty's Government as by those who oppose the Government. I do not speak without knowledge of this subject, and I have satisfied myself that these fears are entertained by people who have studied
<col>468</col>
the question quite independently of politics. I will not read the Articles with regard to contraband of war and foodstuffs nor the Articles with regard to the destruction of neutral ships, because your Lordships know them by heart, but I ask whether those Articles do not require a little further consideration and may not require reservation so as to protect British interests.<lb/>
One answer given by the noble Earl. Lord Desart, the other night, and it has been repeated this evening, was that the proportion of food supplies carried in foreign bottoms is only 10 per cent. as against 90 per cent. carried in home ships. That may be true. I do not think it is accurate, but I will assume it to be true for the moment; and what I have endeavoured to find out from those who have practical knowledge of this matter&#x2014;and this is not a lawyers' question&#x2014;is what the condition of things would be in time of war. I am informed by people whose opinion I can value that you must not -assume that that would be the percentage, or anything like the percentage, if this country were at war. Having regard to the high rate of freights that would prevail in time of war there would be strong competition for carrying our food supplies, and there would be a great inducement to carry them under another flag, and it must not be assumed by any means that the necessities of this country to have her food supplies carried in bottoms other than those flying the British flag would be limited to 10 per cent. in the event of a war. Therefore I think, with very great deference to my noble and learned friend Lord Desart, that you cannot answer the objections by simply referring to the statistics existing at the present time. Of course we all agree that if the condition of Great Britain was such that her Fleet was swept off the seas we need not trouble about anything any more at all. Therefore we need not consider that part of the case.<lb/>
But that is not the answer that has been given. The answer given both by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and to a certain extent by the noble Earl, Lord Desart, is that the interests of this country are protected and the position to a large extent improved by the clause which enables cargoes to go to neutral ports. That is a very dangerous thing to I trust to. Of course, if it could be said that the fact that vessels were bound for Havre, or Cherbourg, or Rotterdam, or Dunquerque
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0260"/>
<col>469</col>
their destination was conclusive, and should be held to be conclusive by the commander of the warship of the other nation, well and good; but, as has been pointed out over and over again, and as was pointed out in the passage read from this very Report, the ship's papers will not be considered by the foreign commander to be conclusive, and I do not think the foreign commander would be doing his duty if he did treat them in every case as conclusive. It is well known to be the commonest thing for neutral vessels to have their bills of lading made out to ports where it is never intended that the cargoes shall be landed, and the answer given the other night seemed to me a very dangerous one. I speak with very great deference in the presence of the Lord Chancellor. He suggested that the position of Great Britain would be improved by the ratification of the Declaration because food supplies could be conveyed <i>via</i> Havre, Calais, Dunquerque, Antwerp, or Rotterdam, but it seems to me that without more information it would be unwise to rely upon this as a practical answer to the objections raised.<lb/>
My Lords, the real fact is, and we ought to recognise it in any consideration of this matter, that Great Britain, with the exception, perhaps, of Japan, stands in a different position from any other of the great nations. America has no fear with regard to her food supplies in time of war. Germany has no fear with regard to her food supplies in time of war, although it may be t hat they might cost her more having to come by train, say from Russia. But our insular position places us in a more dependent position with regard to our food supplies than any other nation in the world, except, possibly, Japan. Then with regard to the clause which speaks about a ship being consigned to a base, is anybody wise enough to say what view ought to he taken by a court as to what that means? Can anybody say that a Court administering justice and equity must decide that any one port in Great Britain is not a base or that any one port is a base? In these circumstances it surely is not asking too much to ask that there might be some further inquiry or some reservation before this country is bound by such a provision. Honestly I cannot see that there is any foundation for saying that things would be better under this Declaration than without it.
<col>470</col>
They may not be worse, and, of course, if they will not be worse, then certainly I think the Convention ought to be ratified. I have made these observations to your Lordships because they struck me as being important points which have come out in this debate which require careful consideration and careful argument. In conclusion, I humbly submit to your Lordships' House that, although you may say we get some advantage in other parts of the Declaration, the national interests of our country ought not to be impaired under this Convention unless we are satisfied that, practically speaking, the food supplies of this country will not be in a worse position when the Convention has been ratified than at the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01075"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise with every feeling of apology for intruding in this debate, but I think it most desirable that the weighty speech to which we have just listened should not be allowed to pass without one or two very brief comments. I know the audacity of the step I take in speaking after the noble and learned Lord. He has had experience, to which he has referred, in international arbitrations which gives him the greatest authority in speaking on this subject. For myself I can claim nothing more than the position of a student of international law; I have been a student of it a good many years, and I can only speak as one who has followed the discussion of this Declaration in the light of previous study.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord made three points as his reasons for taking the attitude which he did. As to the first point, the difficulty of reading the Report with the. Declaration, I believe I am accurate when I say that the Report of M. Renault was read over clause by clause before the whole body who drew up the Declaration, and on being put by the Chairman was assented to by the whole of them. In those circumstances I cannot but conceive that that Report has full official authority as the exposition of the Declaration, and that it has the authority which Lord Desalt attributed to it of a conventional character. The noble and learned Lord pointed out that in cases in which he has been engaged either as arbitrator or as Judge there have often been discussions as to the authorities of Treaties and of communications made with respect to those Treaties. Might I ask him whether he has had any case
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0261"/>
<col>471</col>
which stands on all fours with a Treaty between all parties and a Declaration agreed on by all the parties simultaneously and exchanged between them, because that would be the only comparison which could be rightly applied to this case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01076"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE </member><membercontribution>: Not on all fours, but very like it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01077"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH </member><membercontribution>: All fours is the essence of it, because here you have them all assembled at the same time, coming to the same conclusion and giving their authority to it, and therefore you cannot distinguish between one act of that body and another act of that body, and I should say you must give it the fullest conventional authority. If you can get the Powers who assented to the original Declaration to assent again to a fresh one, no harm would be done; but delay is to be deprecated in this case as indicating some doubt with regard to the conclusions you have arrived at with your fellow diplomats. Also it is quite possible that the ratification might be made taking note of the Declaration as agreed to by the Convention, but I have no doubt whatever that the true interpretation which would be put upon this by any international body such as it is proposed to set up would be that the Report and the Declaration stand upon an equal footing.<lb/>
The second point taken by the noble and learned Lord was as to the necessity acceding to the demand of the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, and getting some further definition of the law which is to be administered by the proposed International Court. The noble and learned Lord was of opinion that you must have a further definition. Why a further definition? In the Declaration itself the law to be set up is explained, and, so far as it has been agreed upon, it is there accepted as the law which is to be administered by the International Court. Upon any points which are not yet decided and which are open to conflict of opinion, the law is to be settled in accordance with the principles of equity and justice. The noble and learned Earl and the noble and learned Lord have a distrust of that latter addition, which is explained in the report of M. Renault as the making of law. Yes, my Lords, it is the making of law in the course of fulfilling what has been declared in the Declaration itself. I am not surprised at the two noble and learned Lords taking up the position they have
<col>472</col>
done with their strong inheritance of the traditions of the Common Law. It is the case of equity informing, fulfilling, and, if need be, correcting, Common Law. Equity prevents the Common Law being made a means of fraud, and it is in that sense only that the Report of M. Renault attributes any law-making power to the International Court.<lb/>
It was with some surprise that I heard the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice say that the law of Prize Courts is the law of England and the law of Lord Stowell. Lord Stowell was the founder of the law which has been adopted by Storey and Wheaton and American Jurists. I have the greatest respect for the authority of Lord Stowell, and I agree that to a very large degree he made the law of Prize Courts throughout the world. But does the noble and learned Lord mean to say that in the decisions in respect of prizes taken in the Russo-Japanese War the Russian Prize Courts followed exactly the law of Lord Stowell? In the case of the ship which has been referred to in the course of the debate, was it Lord Stowell's law that was followed? The supreme merit of the Declaration of London, to my mind, is that it brings the law of the Prize Courts of the world nearer to the law of Lord Stowell than has hitherto been attained. There is a great deal of distrust felt from the way in which this question has been approached. Distrust of an International Court is a thing of which we ought to be a little ashamed. At all events let us consider this: the International Prize Court would be an embodiment of neutral authority; it would make for neutrals against belligerents; it would reduce the power of belligerents in the interests of neutrals; and it would be to the advantage of the law as declared by ourselves in the past that the International Prize Court should be set up and developed on those lines.<lb/>
There was only one other point touched on by the noble and learned Lord with which I would ask leave for one moment to deal&#x2014;namely, the great danger to which we should be exposed under the Declaration of London taken in its entirety in respect to contraband and the supply of food to our country. The noble and learned Lord said with great effect, Who can say what the International Court, when it comes to interpret the law in the future, will hold to be a "base of supply" True, you cannot
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0262"/>
<col>473</col>
say in advance what will be the position of that International Court, which will be a neutral Court standing for the rights of neutrals in the matter, and what it will hold to be a "base of supply." But let us compare the situation with respect to our security for food supplies in the future as regulated by this Declaration of London with the position in which we are now. Under the present law, if we were a belligerent our enemy might declare every port in the United Kingdom to be a base of supply with just the same power and just the same effect, and the only power there would be to decide whether that was valid or not would be the Court of the enemy's Own country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01078"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: Not at all; the power of the neutrals would resist that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01079"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH </member><membercontribution>: No doubt there is a moral force in the power of neutrals: I admit that. But the only Court which would be able to decide whether it was right or not would be the Court of the enemy's own country. That is the only way in which the law would be administered. In future, if we were at war, it would be a question again whether Bristol, or any other port, would be held to be a "base of supply." I agree upon that with one point made by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice&#x2014;that neutrals would be much larger carriers of food supplies in the future than they have been in the past; but why should the neutrals, who would be so much interested, acquiesce in the claim that every port is a base of supply any more than they have done in the past.? And where is the appeal in the future to be? It is to be to an International Court which embodies the interests and the views of neutrality, whereas the legal appeal at the present time is to the Court of the enemy's own country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01080"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can avail myself, I believe, of the right of a very brief reply, having regard to my Motion. First of all I should like to express my gratitude to the noble Viscount the present Leader of the House and to other noble Lords for the kind way in which they have expressed themselves with regard to the whole of this debate, and the manner in which it has been conducted. I regret to say, however, that I am still unconverted, although I have listened to all the arguments addressed to your Lordships' House and also carried out the remarkable advice
<col>474</col>
showered lately upon us by the Government as to reading certain books. Mr. Bray's book was recommended. I have not only read his book, but I asked him to a dinner of the London Chamber of Commerce a few nights ago at which several international lawyers were present. His book before dinner did not convert me, and certainly his speech after dinner did not, and his arguments were somewhat roughly handled by the international lawyers present. If we are to be asked to read some of the books on their side why should they not read some of ours. We have nine ewe lambs to their one, and why should they not read the protests from the Shipping Associations and the thirty or so protests from Chambers of Commerce against the Declaration?<lb/>
In opening the debate in this House last week I pressed the Government for information on four points&#x2014;first: Is the Declaration, if ratified, binding on the' signatory Powers even if the Prize Court is not set up? Secondly, Is the commentary of M. Renault to be considered an authoritative interpretation of the Declaration? Thirdly, Will the Government name a port in this country to which conditional contraband can be taken in neutral ships in time of war? And, finally, Have any countries yet ratified the Declaration? I do not think I have received a categorical answer to those questions, except to the one with regard to a port. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack did give an answer with regard to that and he was good enough to name Bristol. I am glad to hear that Bristol is a port to which grain can be carried in neutral ships when we are at war, because Bristol is a most important port. I have looked up her commerce for some years past, and I find that in some respects as a grain-importing centre she holds an important position. She is the first port in barley in the United Kingdom, and a large amount of foodstuff is imported there. We heard from the Lord Chancellor that Bristol under present conditions is a free port. But I should like to ask him, and this seems to me to be more important, What would the opinion be of a hostile commander who met a neutral ship coming to Bristol? That commander would say, "Bristol is very near Salisbury Plain." I believe that my noble friend on the Woolsack could even now walk from Bristol to Salisbury Plain, where we have one of the largest military encampments in this country, and in his days of greater
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0263"/>
<col>475</col>
activity but lesser dignity, when I had the honour of playing cricket with him, he could have walked there and back in the day. It is only 25 miles front Bristol to Bulford Camp, where we have a large permanent Artillery station and a great camp of troops, certainly the biggest in this country next to Aldershot. I have been in camp there myself and I know something about it, and I am afraid that under the Declaration Bristol would be considered a port of supply for armed forces, as indeed it is. And certainly in the Report of the Drafting Committee which is signed by M. Renault it would be considered a base for the supply of armed forces. I certainly agree with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice and the noble Lord who has just sat down that in time of war there would be a rush for a neutral flag at first until they saw who was going to be master of the seas and master of the trade routes, and no doubt the grain from North America and the United States would gravitate to United States ports and would be shipped in" neutral bottoms and sent to Plymouth, but whether it would get there under this Declaration is another thing. There is also another matter. A great deal of our Atlantic shipping is in the bands of the United States now practically, although the English flag is flown.<lb/>
With regard to the Report of M. Renault, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has distinctly stated that that Report is authoritative. I think Lord Desart called it an "inspired commentary," which places it rather higher. I am afraid there was some misunderstanding with regard to this. In my first statement I alluded to M. Renault's Report on Convention No. 12, which sets up the International Prize Court, as being vague. It is, indeed, extraordinarily vague. The report certainly says that the Prize Court is&#x2014;
<quote>"to make the law, and to take into account other principles than those to which are submitted the National Prize Court Jurisdiction."</quote>
It also says&#x2014;
<quote>"How is nationality, property, or domicile to be proved? Is it only by the ship's papers or equally by other documents produced? We intend to leave the Court full power of appreciation."</quote>
All these matters are most technical. Again the Report says&#x2014;
<quote>"Every liberty is to be left to the Court as to the appreciation of the various elements furnished to it to determine the conclusion. There is not here a legal system of proof."</quote>
<col>476</col>
This was all said when the international system was set up, before the Declaration. That is how the Court was set up, and none of the principles of the Declaration were then thought of. My point is that, instead of getting the unity and certainty that we were promised, we should, by adopting the Convention and setting up a Court in the manner proposed, throw the whole of the existing naval prize law of the world into absolute chaos and confusion.<lb/>
My Lords, at this hour I will not go into the other points, but I should like to say this. I asked whether the Declaration would be binding without the International Prize Court being set up. The noble Viscount the Leader of the Government, in his reply, did not seem to be aware of what the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had said. The Foreign Secretary said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Declaration of London will be applied by the Prize Courts in the countries which ratify it as part of the Law of Nations."</quote>
We hear much of the appeal to the International Prize Court, but it does not matter two snaps of the finger w hat that Court decides. It is only a question of compensating the ships that are sunk. It is a question of sending the contraband to the bottom.<lb/>
I do not intend to press the Motion to a Division. I am very glad to hear that His Majesty's Government are going, although late in the day, to take our Colonies into their confidence. I do not know whether the House is aware that we have already signed at the Hague thirteen Conventions, nine of which have been ratified, and I venture to say that the country will be rather surprised when it learns the terms of some of those which have been ratified. As I have said, I am happy to think that sufficient time for the consideration of this document of vital importance has been agreed to by His Majesty's Government, and perhaps the suggestion thrown out by the Motion and by the noble and learned Lord on my left may, after the Colonial Conference, be carried into operation. I beg to withdraw the Motion.</membercontribution></p>

In Clause 5 there occur the words, "or other document which he is authorised or required to make, attest, or verify by, under, or for the purposes of any public general Act of Parliament." That, I think, would include a considerable number of documents in respect of which, according to the present law, perjury cannot be assigned; and as we are really as far as we can only consolidating the law the words "under or for the purposes of" are too wide, are not wanted to preserve the existing law, and might open the door to the inclusion of documents

This is a clause to consolidate and codify the law under which punishment may be imposed on any person who knowingly or wilfully makes a statement false in a material particular, though it may not be on oath. The clause provides that the person shall be punished if the false statement is made in a statutory declaration, or in an abstract, account, and so forth, "which he is authorised or required to make, attest, or verify, by, under, or for the purposes of any public general Act of Parliament." My noble friend the Lord Chief Justice thinks it ought to read" attest or verify by any public general Act of Parliament. "I think that is really on the whole safer, because if we were to include a document required to be made under or for the purposes of" a public general Act of Parliament, it might. comprise within the net some offences which are not now punishable. There is a further reason. If these words are omitted, any false statement which is now punishable would not cease to be punishable, but being of extremely rare occurrence would have to be dealt with under the particular Acts as they arose. In this difficult work I think it is better to be on the safe side, and I accept my noble and learned friend's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SHORTAGE OF ARMY OFFICERS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01108"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> rose to call attention to the facts&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. That the number of Regular Infantry officers required for the Expeditionary Force, exclusive of Staff, is 2,461;</li>
<li>2. That the number of Regular officers required for the four battalions at home is 112, and that the number of Regular Infantry officers shown in the Army List for January last as not seconded is 1,998.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01109">To ask the Under-Secretary of State for War if the total deficiency of Regular Infantry officers for the Expeditionary Force is 575. exclusive of Staff, that is a deficiency of seven officers per battalion, equivalent to one quarter of the total complement of Regular officers per battalion, and necessitating the depletion of the four home battalions by every Regular officer belonging to them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01110">To ask the number of Regular. Infantry officers required for Staff duties with the Regular Infantry and the Regular Mounted Infantry of the Expeditionary Force in addition to the 2,461.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01111">To ask if the fact of four Infantry battalions being left at home after the departure of the Expeditionary Force means an addition of three battalions to the seventy-five scheduled for the Expeditionary Force by Table I of Army Memorandum dated 8th April, 1907.</p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01113">The noble Duke said: My Lords, in the Questions which I have on the Paper I call your attention to some figures supplied to me by the Under-Secretary of State for War. These numbers show that there will be a considerable shortage of Regular Infantry officers on mobilisation
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0266"/>
<col>481</col>
both for the Expeditionary Force and for the four Infantry battalions remaining at home on the departure of the Expeditionary Force. They prove the correctness of the statement which I made a short time ago but as to the accuracy of which the Under-Secretary of State for War then demurred. I cannot expect your Lordships to attach much importance to the figures which I use in discussing Army matters if I allow the Under-Secretary of State for War to disregard them without attempting to explain how or why my calculations are wrong. The question is a very simple one. Will there or will there not be a sufficient number of Regular Infantry officers on mobilisation for the requirements of the Expeditionary Force and for the four home battalions? I lay stress upon the point of Regular Infantry officers, because I am not in the least concerned to know the total number of officers now available for service abroad in the Officers Training Corps, in the Special Reserve, or in the Reserve of Officers, because none of these are in any sense fit for First Line duty at short notice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01114">The figures on the Paper show that 2,461 Regular Infantry officers are required for the Expeditionary Force exclusive of Staff, and also 112 officers for the four home battalions. There were on January 1 last 1,998 Regular Infantry officers not seconded. Seconded officers represent officers employed by the Colonial Office, or serving with the Egyptian Army, or on the Staff of the Regular and Territorial Army at home, or with the Special Reserve; in short, all officers not available for regimental duty. The total required is 2,573. There are available 1,998. This shows a deficit of 575. But it also means that there would not he a single Regular officer with the four home battalions. This, of course, would be impossible, and no doubt the deficit would be divided between the Expeditionary Force and the four home battalions. The average deficit is seven officers per battalion, or one quarter of the total complement of officers for an Infantry battalion, which is twenty-eight. Now if our Infantry battalions are called upon to take the field with one quarter of their complement of officers deficient and with far more Reservists, some of whom have been absent from the Colours ten, twelve, or thirteen years, than serving soldiers in the ranks, and if battalions thus organised should fail in the hour of need,
<col>482</col>
it is not their fault, but the fault of those responsible for such an organisation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01115">Two of the chief reasons for the deficiency of Regular Infantry officers are: First, that there are at present in round numbers 600 Regular Infantry officers required for the Special Reserve. I pointed out when the Special Reserve was first created that, however advantageous this transfer might be for the new force, the Special Reserve, it would be a disastrous drain on the resources of the Line. Secondly, owing to the deficiency in the Regular Cavalry for the Expeditionary Force it has been decided to use Mounted Infantry to act as Divisional Cavalry for the six Infantry Divisions. But the numbers of Regular Infantry are not equal to this demand. At present the shortage shows itself chiefly in officers, but in two years' time, when the Reserve has dropped by 30,000 men, the deficiency will be shown both in officers and men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01116"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY or STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like, if I may, to make one general observation on what the noble Duke has just said. It is generally known to be part of our military system, as of all military systems, that on mobilisation the peace establishment has to be brought up to the war establishment. I do not know whether we have dropped into the habit of considering the matter as if it only applied to men, but, of course, it does, and always will, apply to officers as well. The war establishment of officers required is always different from the peace establishment. There are always a certain number of officers to be found on mobilisation for various duties for which they are not required in peace time, so that if you take the number of officers serving with the Colours in peace time and compare them with what would be required for war, there is, of course, a deficit. The regular way in which that has been met has hitherto been, I believe, to use the Reserve of Officers&#x2014;a body which is now a considerable size. We have that: source to draw upon, and we also have the officers of the Special Reserve. Those two categories together would supply us with a considerable number of officers, and on them undoubtedly, to a more or less degree, we shall draw when the time comes for mobilisation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0267"/>
<col>483</col>
This is the second series of questions which the noble Duke has asked dealing with this subject, and I confess that they do put us in some difficulty with regard to answering them. I have always disliked having to refuse information to this House, and I hope I have never done so except when information has been asked for with regard to our position on mobilisation. I have gone into the matter carefully as to what has been the proceeding of this Government and of previous Governments, and I can say with absolute certainty that we have gone a great deal further than previous Governments in supplying information as to actual procedure on mobilisation. We have discussed this question before in your Lordships' House when the noble Viscount, Lord Hardinge, raised it, and on that occasion I fortified my refusal to give the information asked for by quoting cases where the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition and Lord Donoughmore had also refused to give what I may call mobilisation details. I was further fortified by the refusals that Lord Midleton gave when he was in the House of Commons. From a careful examination of the precedents of what has been given and what has been refused, broadly speaking, anything in the nature of detailed information as to mobilisation organisation or arrangements has invariably been refused. But information has occasionally been given as to our general capacity to mobilise. Those are the lines on which I am perfectly prepared to proceed now.<lb/>
The Questions which the noble Duke asks fall under the first of those categories. They go in considerable detail into our military organisation. I frankly admit, with regard to the answering of these Questions, that from my previous experience in discussions with the noble Duke, the noble Duke is far too formidable a controversialist for me to contemplate with any pleasure the idea of embarking on a discussion with him on this question, when I am bound to fight with, to a more or less extent, one of my hands tied behind my back, because I cannot, without revealing the whole of our mobilisation proposals, explain the position on which he is asking for information. In those circumstances I am simply following the precedent that has been set by, I think, all Governments in this matter, in saying that I am very sorry that I cannot give him the answers.<lb/>
<col>484</col>
But, if the House wishes it, I am quite prepared to give a statement as to our general position and our general capacity to mobilise the Expeditionary Force and to maintain troops adequate for home defence. I would suggest, if the House wishes for information on that point something of the following nature. There was a Command Paper No. 3,366 laid before Parliament in April, 1907. It was a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War, with tables showing the war establishment, the composition of the field force and other particulars. That was issued in connection with the Territorial Reserve Forces Bill, which was being brought in during that Session of Parliament; it is the Paper which is probably known to a good many of your Lordships as the Wyndham Return, it having been the result of Questions asked by Mr. George Wyndham in the other House in this Paper we did give the war establishments of the proposed Expeditionary Force giving the total officers and men by arms and those war establishments we are perfectly prepared to bring up to date. The composition of the Expeditionary Force has been modified in certain comparatively small details, and we are prepared to show in that form what is the present establishment of the Expeditionary Force.<lb/>
Later, about June, 1909, there was laid on the Table of your Lordships' House another Paper, Cd. 4611. That was a Memorandum by the Army Council on the then state of the military forces in the United Kingdom, and the Paper contained tables of comparison. It gave the figures, first, of officers serving in the United Kingdom who were liable for service abroad; it also gave the number of men who were liable by their terms of enlistment and available by age and service for service abroad, and also one or two other tables. We would be prepared also, having given what our requirements are for the Expeditionary Force, to bring such tables in that last Command Paper as are germane to the subject up to date, with the object of showing your Lordships what our resources are from which we can mobilise the Expeditionary Force. In all those cases the figures are given by what I may call the gross total for each arm in officers and men, and I hope that in the circumstances your Lordships will accept that. I regret very much to have to be
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0268"/>
<col>485</col>
compelled to refuse the information for which the noble Duke has asked, but I can assure the House that I have taken particular pains in this matter, not only to take the opinion of the Army Council upon it, but also to consider very carefully what have been the precedents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01117"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not quite gather from the noble Lord to which of my Questions he thinks it is not in the public interest to reply. The answer to all the Questions is contained in Army Returns that we already have. There is no doubt about the deficiency of officers, because the noble Lord gave me the figures himself; and there is no doubt about the number of Infantry battalions to go abroad, because that appears in Table 1 of the Army Memorandum of April 8. The only Question not answered is whether the noble Lord is going to employ Mounted Infantry instead of Divisional Cavalry for these Infantry Divisions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01118"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord the Under-Secretary has taken credit to the Government that they have been extremely liberal in the amount of information they have given us on this subject. I think that is perfectly true. We have no reason to complain of the statistical information which they have given us, but the noble Lord rather thinks that we are pressing him for answers to questions which in the public interest ought not to be answered. I quite feel that he has a right to great consideration from all of us, but I think the noble Lord hardly sees the effect of his argument. Having given these statistics and these tables, he backs them up by large general statements to which I called attention on a recent occasion, and when we try to find whether those statements are made good by the tables, the noble Lord refuses to be drawn into a discussion on the deductions from those tables as compared with his own statements.<lb/>
The noble Duke pointed out that the figures in his first two Questions are mere facts which any foreign officer can make good for himself. There are the tables&#x2014;and I thank the noble Lord for saying he will bring them up to date&#x2014;and there are the Estimates, in which the strength of officers and men and the Reserve of Officers is duly shown. The deduction can be
<col>486</col>
made without the slightest difficulty by any man who has these public documents in his hand. What we mind is this. The noble Lord made a statement across the Table a few moments ago to the effect that it is quite true the war establishment of officers is in excess of the peace establishment, and that you will always have to draw a certain number of officers on mobilisation who are not wanted for duties in time of peace. But he says that for that purpose we have the Reserve of Officers and the Special Reserve to draw upon. The noble Lord only the other night drew rather largely on our credulity as to our power to defend ourselves at home after the Expeditionary Force has gone, and in doing so especially alluded to and counted the battalions of the Special Reserve. The Special Reserve is 1,000 officers under its strength at present; and what the noble Lord has told us to-night amounts to this, that in order to mobilise the Expeditionary Force he has to draw on the officers of the Special Reserve, who are 1,000 under their strength. That is a most serious position. I really think that when we come to close quarters with this question we must ask the noble Lord to be ready to tell us how he proposes to mobilise the vast mass of troops which would be left at home after the Expeditionary Force had been sent abroad.<lb/>
The noble Lord in his speeches is always drawing comparisons, is always speaking of the advance which has been made, and of the position now as compared with five years ago. I wish we could sweep away that altogether. I am ready to make good the position five years ago, and I will, if the noble Lord wishes it, put on paper figures showing not the establishments but the strength as it was five years ago, allowing, of course, for the Reserve which was then coming into being but which had not actually accrued at the moment, and he will find that our position then bears most favourable comparison with our present position. But that is not the question before your Lordships.<lb/>
The point is whether, the Secretary of State having stated to Parliament and to the country over and over again that certain forces are in his opinion necessary in order to defend the country after the Expeditionary Force has gone abroad, those forces have really been brought into being. We do not expect him to
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0269"/>
<col>487</col>
make bricks without straw, but I do believe that the whole of the officer question requires to be taken up <i>ab initio.</i> You have reached the limit at which you must pay more for your officers if you wish to get them; you must offer more inducements than hitherto. I do not think it is fair to ask us to be content when we know that the figures shown in the official documents do not bear out the desire of the Government on mobilisation, and to tell us that if we draw the deductions which can be drawn from these figures we
<col>488</col>
are trenching on what is to the advantage of the country. Therefore I hope the noble Lord will not take it amiss if, after he has published these figures, he is asked to put in parallel columns how many troops he has left at home fully officered and fit to take the field. We may then be able to put before the country what the state of our forces is after the Expeditionary has left these islands.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01122" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01123">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01124"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill that I am going to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this afternoon, though simple in appearance and short in form, deals, however, with a question that is of supreme and far-reaching importance to the general welfare of our people, and a question that I am sure will command sympathetic attention and interest in any place where social reform is a subject of earnest consideration, and in no place more, I believe, than in your Lordships' House. The Bill is concerned with street trading amongst children, and is framed to remove that which those of your Lordships who have made a study of the question, or may have come in personal contact with it, or have given a brief consideration to the Report issued by the Departmental Committee appointed in 1909, will readily recognise is an evil to the community at large, and as such requires treatment.<lb/>
The Bill, as you will see from the Memorandum which appears on the front page of it, is based entirely upon the Report of the Departmental Committee, and the effect of it is to give statutory prohibition to any street trading by boys under the age of seventeen and by girls under the age of eighteen. Taking into consideration the law as it now stands, it may be argued that the provisions of this Bill are somewhat uncompromising and severe in character, and the change proposed drastic in effect. But, my Lords, I would remind you that
<col>490</col>
the evils of street trading are far-reaching in character, and are such, judging from the evidence before the Departmental Committee and the Report issued as the result of that inquiry, as to demand forcible measures being taken to remove them in the interests of the people of this country. In making my case for the Second Reading of this Bill I desire to lay before your Lordships the existing state of the law on the subject, the evils which the Bill proposes to remedy, the manner in which the law at present fails, and the reasons for taking power under an Act of Parliament to prevent further street trading amongst children.<lb/>
The subject was of sufficient importance for the granting of a searching inquiry and the appointment of a Departmental Committee for this purpose. The inquiry was instituted, I would remind your Lordships, in accordance with a promise given in another place during the discussion in Committee of the Bill of 1908, for which Bill, for some reason which I have never been able to understand, the Liberal Party appropriated the somewhat grandiloquent term '' The Children's Charter," as if implying that no person, individual, or Party, had ever concerned themselves with, or thought it necessary to give time for making provision for, the betterment or welfare of the children of this country. I admit this is no important point in considering this Bill. Still, I could not help recalling the habit of members of the Party of noble Lords opposite to assume the monopoly of any legislation or thought upon subjects that come within this category.<lb/>
The Committee, when appointed, proceeded to hear a mass of very important evidence. All the great cities and populous centres were visited, including Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, Belfast, Birmingham, and Liverpool, and the evidence submitted was of the highest order and of the greatest value, and none more so than the evidence of the Wage Earning Committee, which was based on personal investigation of a great number of these cases of street trading. It Was of the minutest character, and speaks volumes for the thoroughness of the work of, and the pains taken by, the secretary of the Committee on Wage Earning Children (Miss Constance Smith), and Miss Hargreaves, the lady who was with her, who made such an exhaustive study of the question. The consensus of evidence goes to show that street trading
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0271"/>
<col>491</col>
is substantially on the increase, and that the returns available giving the estimated number of children engaged in this practice show far below the real number.<lb/>
What is the existing state of the law on the subject, and, what is of equal importance, what is the actual meaning of the term "street trading"? This is clearly given in Section 13 of the Act of 1903, which provides that the expression "street trading" includes "the hawking of news- papers, matches, flowers, and other articles, playing, singing, or performing for profit, shoeblacking, or any other like occupation carried on in streets or public places"; and the existing law upon this subject is set out very clearly in the Report that has been issued. It says that there is an absolute statutory prohibition against children engaging in street trading under the age of eleven. There is also a statutory provision prohibiting employment of any kind after 9 p.m. or before 6 a.m. of children under fourteen. Those are prohibitions of night work; but in the day time between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. a child who has reached the age of eleven is restrained from street trading only so far as by-laws for this purpose have been made and put in force by the local authority, with the approval of the Home Secretary. Whilst by-laws have been made in accordance with the statutory powers I have quoted in nearly all the great county boroughs of England and Wales and in the great centres of population there is at the same time evidence to show that in many instances the by-laws are not rigidly enforced, and in several cases they are easily evaded.<lb/>
But what about the populous cities where no by-laws exist at all, such as Leeds, Nottingham, Salford, and other places? And in only forty-one out of a total of 191 smaller boroughs and smaller urban districts are there any provisions made at all to regulate street trading. This latter fact may be taken to indicate that it is only in the crowded centres that the evil is most pressing; but, on the other hand, there is trustworthy evidence to show that an objectionable form of street trading goes on even in the smaller county towns of England, where even the Act which prohibits street trading under the age of eleven is ignored, and where this objectionable practice begins late in the evening and is carried on till late at night. In Scotland the Act of 1903 is practically a dead letter. In Edinburgh
<col>492</col>
children as young as seven have been found trading in the streets. No county council out of thirty-two councils has made ally by-laws to deal with the question, and only four burghs out of fifty-six. In Ireland no county council has any by-laws at all and only five boroughs, and in the town of Waterford children have been found selling newspapers up till 11 o'clock at night.<lb/>
Of Belfast I can speak from experience. I know that street trading there takes rather an aggressive form. There the boys who hawk newspapers, in many instances attractive and winning in their ways, are really a public nuisance, both from the manner in which they press their wares upon the general public and also from the manner in which they shout them out. The Belfast Corporation, of which I have the honour to be a member, have lately become alive to the necessity of a more rigid enforcement of the by-laws which they lave made. But, my Lords, with all local authorities there is somehow a difficulty in this matter. They seem to shrink from imposing too strict an observance upon by-laws that perhaps have been drawn up at the dictates of conscience. There is somehow, shall I say? a kind of false sentiment cropping up very often in the minds and hearts of the City Fathers. I have often seen it myself, and I think there is a tendency to approach the matter rather more from the individual standpoint than from the point of view of the general good. And this is one of my reasons for asking that the <i>onus</i> and responsibility should be taken away from local authorities and statutory prohibition granted, and that the whole thing should be a matter of the law of the land as against provisions being made by county councils.<lb/>
It has been suggested that in lieu of statutory prohibition there should be an extension of the local powers granted to local bodies. I believe that is really the substance of the Minority Report of the Departmental Committee, but the effect of such proposals would be to throw not only the onus and responsibility upon the local authority in the case of any boy of determining whether the street trading had been carried on for a beneficial purpose, but it would also fall upon them to ascertain whether there was any better or more suitable employment in the town or in the district. I submit that this would throw too heavy a burden upon the local authority,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0272"/>
<col>493</col>
and would in most cases be either explicitly or tacitly declined. But apart from showing how the existing provisions are insufficient and the law as it stands inadequate, I want to make it quite clear to your Lordships that street trading, even when surrounded with the best safeguards that carefully-drawn by-laws duly enforced can provide, is in itself an evil which ought to be removed from the lives of the children, at any rate until they come to years of discretion, by which time we may hope they will have found better and more permanent employment.<lb/>
Here I should say that I have no wish to quarrel with what is sometimes erroneously included in street trading&#x2014;namely, suburban delivery work. By that I refer to boys who carry and deliver newspapers and milk from door to door. These boys are more often than not employed either by the newsagent or by the shopkeeper, who pays and controls them, as against the curbstone seller who hawks his wares in our crowded cities and who is invariably his own master, and anybody who comes in contact with street trading draws a sharp distinction between these two classes. There is ample proof to satisfy the most exacting inquirer that street trading is not an improving occupation for the minds of the children, but, on the other hand, has a very detrimental effect. The Report of the Departmental Committee is most emphatic on the subject. If your Lordships will permit me, I will quote a few sentences from the Committee's Report&#x2014;
<quote>"The youthful street trader is exposed to many of the worst of moral risks; he associates with, and acquires the habits of the frequenters of the kerbstone and the gutter. If a matchseller, ho is likely to become a beggar&#x2014;if a newspaper seller, a gambler; the evidence before us was extraordinarily strong as to the extent to which betting prevails among the boy vendors of evening papers. There was an almost equally strong body of testimony to the effect that, at any rate in crowded centres of population, street trading tends to produce a dislike or disability for more regular employment; the child finds that for a few years money is easily earned without discipline or special skill; and the occupation is one which sharpens the wits without developing the intelligence. It leads to nothing permanent, and in no way helps him to a future career. There can be no doubt that large numbers of those who were once street traders drift into vagrancy and crime. Chief constables testified that street trading is the most fruitful apprenticeship to evil courses&#x2026;So far as girls are concerned, there must be added to the above evils an unquestionable danger to morals in the narrower sense. The evidence presented to us on this point was unanimous and most emphatic."</quote>
<col>494</col>
So you will see, my Lords, that, amongst other things, street trading may lead to betting and gambling amongst the boys. In fact, it may mean the channel through which a boy is brought in contact with these vices.<lb/>
I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to some evidence on this point which is of interest. I take this from the evidence of the secretary of the Wage Earning Committee&#x2014;
<quote>"One sees little newspaper boys sitting down, live or six together, on any convenient doorstep, with their heads together over the betting news. I have taken special note of it in the last few months, and it is the only part of the paper the boys ever seem to look at."</quote>
Then we have some interesting evidence as to the betting clubs which they get up among themselves. An investigator from Sheffield says&#x2014;
<quote>"Each boy has his gang, and they take a pride in dodging the police and in living a life of lawlessness. They are highly organised in their own way. There is a private gambling club ran by street traders behind a certain ice-cream shop, where, through a regular system of insurance, fines for gambling and theft are met out of the common funds. Many books are made in coppers by young bookmakers, and a certain youth who was given 10s. by a kind gentleman to buy fruit for hawking purposes immediately went to the back of the ice-cream shop and made a book amongst his mates."</quote>
I believe, my Lords, that that gambling club no longer exists.<lb/>
Not only does street trading affect the morals of these lads; it must also affect their health. It is bound to undermine their health if children are inadequately clothed and inadequately fed; but still it may affect their health even less than it may affect their minds and their morals. School managers and educationists are all of one accord in saying that street trading has a uniformly bad effect on the mind of the child. It gives children a distaste for application. They lose early in life the essential quality of being able to apply their minds to anything, educational or otherwise. They acquire an absolute liking for casual labour, and even in these infant stages of their career they apparently fall victims to the idea that it is not necessary to work in order to gain a living. Mr. Beveridge, the Director of Labour Exchanges under the Board of Trade, gives some interesting evidence on this point. He first expresses the opinion that once a street trader
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0273"/>
<col>495</col>
always a street trader, and to his inquiry among the larger London Exchanges as to whether any applications were received from boys and girls engaged in street trading, the answer was that they never get such applications. There are 25,000 boys and 10,000 girls registered at the Metropolitan Labour Exchanges, but street traders figure very rarely amongst them. What is the result? Undoubtedly they must in time go to swell the ranks of the unemployed, and, what is far worse, the ranks of the unemployable; and it is my firm conviction that this street trading class afford a good recruiting ground for the corner boy and the street loafer.<lb/>
We are anxious, my Lords, as I am sure you must be, to see the opportunity of taking up a living without having learnt a trade removed, the temptation taken away&#x2014;in other words, the boys saved for future chances. I am one of those who believe that opportunities for employment for boys and girls when leaving school are improving, and are going to improve. The employment question has been very much to the fore of late; the necessity of providing greater facilities for wage earners to come in touch with the labour markets has been recognised; and, what is more important, the value of watching over the interests of children when leaving school by registering them at Labour Exchanges and by keeping them in touch with voluntary organisations of ladies and gentlemen who are attached to groups of schools is being daily more appreciated. What appeals to me more than anything else is this educational work that has been done apart from Labour Exchanges, for, after all, Labour Exchanges can only register applications and are registering machines. The education is to be done before the boy leaves school by the voluntary committees of ladies and gentlemen who are attached to schools and who will bring influence to bear upon the mind of the parent and upon the child, and will set the child's feet upon a rock rather than let him drift into the mire and the clay.<lb/>
I have only one other topic to touch upon in regard to this question. Will there be any unnecessary hardship if these proposals are carried out? I do not think so. Not more than there must always be when that is disallowed which has hitherto been allowed. There may be occasional hardship, Take the case of the street trader who has been assisting an im-
<col>496</col>
pecunious home. The Bill allows a whole year or more for life to be adjusted to the altered circumstances. As a rule, parents are ashamed of their children's street trading. Some parents, too lazy to work, depend entirely for their living on what they get from the earnings of their children, and I do not think there can be any valid objection on behalf of such a class as that. Is there any other class from which objections may arise? There is the great and important newspaper trade, but I do not think it is asking the great newspaper proprietors too much, where the ruin and waste of child life are concerned, to make other arrangements for the selling of their wares than by casual child labour. Would it not be possible to employ adult labour in this connection? I know that some of the evening newspapers&#x2014;the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, the <i>Globe</i>, the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>, and others&#x2014;have no difficulty in getting old men to sell their papers. Perhaps with regard to the halfpenny newspapers there might be more difficulty, but I cannot say. As far as newsagents and booksellers are concerned, I am quite sure they would welcome the Bill. They are always prone to contend that they can very well satisfy the public demand for newspapers, either by kiosks or by making arrangements such as one sees on the Continent.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I have finished. I have only to make a final appeal to your Lordships to give this Bill a Second Reading, which I make in the interests of the children, and. in the light of experience, still more in the interests of home life and of the welfare of the people of our country. How tenderly and with what care do we watch over and protect the life and growth of the young tree or plant in which we are interested. Prevention, as the old saying goes, is better than cure; and would it not be better and wiser and more prudent and economically more sound to treat and deal with the root of the disease than to wait until it has blossomed into maturity? Would it not be better to do what is in our power to attempt to make a reduction in the prison and criminal class instead of exhausting energy in endeavouring to find some modification in prison regulations which are not detrimental or demoralising in their effect? I do not claim for one moment that the proposals in this Bill are to be a panacea for all the evil growths of unemployables, but this I do say and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0274"/>
<col>497</col>
believe&#x2014;that the existing permissive law has been tried and found wanting, and that restrictions such as I am now proposing, coupled with voluntary effort and assistance and supervision, will materially effect an improvement where an improvement is sorely needed. I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01125">Moved., that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Shaftesbury</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01126"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OR WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise on behalf of His Majesty's Government to give general support to the provisions of this Bill, subject. to certain Amendments which we may find it necessary to make in Committee when that stage is reached in your Lordships' House. I am glad to express the thanks of the Home Office to the noble Earl for having brought forward this question, and I think all those who are interested in social reform will agree that this is a matter which is now ripe for further legislation.<lb/>
I hope the noble Earl will allow me, in the first place, to point out how inaccurate the statement is which is comprised in the Memorandum prefixed to this Bill, to the effect that the object of the Bill is "to amend the Employment of Children Act exactly as suggested by the Departmental Committee." In the first place, the noble Earl will see that by subsection (b) of Clause 2 he proposes to take away the whole of the administration of this matter from the Secretary of State and the Home Office and to put it in the charge of the Board of Education. The noble Earl, I hope, will allow me to say that there is no such recommendation in the Report of the Departmental Committee appointed by the Home Secretary. Neither the Majority nor the Minority Report contains, any suggestion to that effect.<lb/>
Then there is the new suggestion in subsection (c), for which I think, in the same way, the noble Earl will be unable to find any support in the Departmental Committee's Report. It is that these children should be sent to a certified reformatory school. Let me explain why we dislike such a provision as that. The idea is that reformatory schools should be reserved for children who have really committed some
<col>498</col>
serious offence. We wish to send to these schools only those children who have committed such an offence that had the same offence been committed by somebody of riper years would have sent him to prison. Therefore it is an entirely new departure, and one which we, deprecate, that children who have committed some offence against the Employment of Children Act&#x2014;not generally a very serious offence&#x2014;should be sent to associate with the class of child they would meet with in a reformatory school. That provision 1 hope the noble Earl will see reason to alter.<lb/>
There are two other points on which I should like to make a few remarks. In the first place, there was the point mentioned by the noble Earl himself about the date at which this Bill is to come into operation. The general principles of the Bill we agree with, and I, venture to suggest to the noble Earl that he might find it easier to get the Bill through its various stages if he were to do something to deal with the children who are now engaged in street trading and who would be unable, as soon as the Bill came into operation, to continue their' present occupation. I think he would very likely find that some provision which, without weakening the ultimate effect of tins Bill, still made some temporary arrangement for children of that kind would materially diminish the hostility to the Bill.<lb/>
Then I think I ought to warn the noble Earl that there is a good deal a opposition to be expected from proprietors of newspapers, as indeed he himself indicated, and also from various other quarters. Tradesmen's boys who are regularly employed in delivering to customers very often sell under the present system. I think there will be great objection to abolishing that system. I do not say there will be any from this side of the House, but I warn the noble Earl that he may expect such objection to be raised. Then there are the children who sell farm and home produce in the country. Another result of the Bill would be to prohibit costermongers' children up to these ages from helping their parents. I mention these points, not with any view of expressing hostility on my own account, but to warn the noble Earl that he will have to encounter opposition upon them. I think this Bill marks a further stage in
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0275"/>
<col>499</col>
the education of public opinion in this country, and I hope the noble Earl will be able, not only to carry a Bill founded on these principles, but also to awake somewhat further that public opinion throughout the country which, as he reminded us himself this evening, is somewhat slack in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01127"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the speech of the noble Earl who has just sat clown it is, perhaps, hardly necessary for any one else to say a word on this important matter, but I should be sorry if the Second Reading of the Bill passed without a further expression of sympathy. The noble Earl who has introduced this Bill has done fresh honour, if I may say so, to the name which he bears, and has shown that he is in direct line of descent morally from the great man who did, I suppose, more than any single man in the last century to call the attention of his countrymen to the duty of using public authorities and the machinery of administration and law in such a way as to control the incidence of mere commercial pressure upon the weaker parts of the population. He did it constantly, of course, against the pressure of arguments such as possibly may be used, if I understood aright the noble Earl who spoke from the Front Government Bench, by one trade particularly interested in this case&#x2014;that his proposals were fatal to the commercial prosperity of such and such an industry.<lb/>
I think it is well to point out that the noble Earl in this proposal has fixed upon, perhaps, the most urgent chapter of the most urgent part of the case for legislation of this particular kind. There has been a good deal of discussion in different forms as to the method which should be followed in bringing about the improvements urged by the Poor Law Commission (in both its parts), and some have expressed the hope that there would emanate from His Majesty's Government a comprehensive measure dealing with some of these evils. There is a great deal to be said for that, and I think I see one or two points in this particular measure at which it can be said that one of your proposals requires to be accompanied by another if it is not to work hardly. If you throw boys out of employment it may be said you ought to have some reasonable proposal to show how employment can be found for those boys.<lb/>
<col>500</col>
There is objection to all piecemeal legislation. But, on the other hand, a deputation from the Houses of Convocation, of which I was a member and which was accorded a courteous reception by the Prime Minister, was plainly told by Mr. Asquith that comprehensive legislation was almost impossible on such matters. The Prime Minister recommended piecemeal legislation and, if I remember aright, two subjects were particularly selected on that occasion. The Prime Minister endorsed remarks which had fallen from others, and said he thought that the matter of the feeble-minded and the matter of boys were two capital instances of topics ripe for piecemeal treatment. The noble Earl has followed the Prime Minister's advice, and has followed it logically. If it is easier to get a measure confined to boys than to get one on a general matter, it is obviously easier to get one which deals with street trading by boys than with boys in general.<lb/>
I do not suppose there is any doubt that boys employed in this kind of way in the great cities are exactly the boys for whom we should like to go most straight and who are suffering most under the present system. It always seems to me that our treatment of boy life in the great cities suggests the comparison of a body which is continually bleeding through a wound. The life of the nation is really bleeding away through the conditions under which boy life is brought up, and nowhere more, nowhere perhaps so much, as in the case of these particular boys. We have heard a good deal about the drawbacks in the case of van boy and errand boy employments because they do not lead anywhere, but the Committee which has dealt with this matter point out that the street trading in question is infinitely worse than van boy or errand boy employment. The van boy has a definite job, and is under an employer who probably will come down upon him if he does not keep his time. But the position of the newspaper boy is one of the most delightful&#x2014;I am speaking from the boy's point of view&#x2014;and perilous independence that it is possible to conceive. We were told that the interests of the newspaper trade will be appealed to, and it may be said that the boys who sell newspapers are the <i>employ&#x00E8;s</i> of the newspaper, but the newspaper people, we are also told on authority, do not hold themselves in the slightest degree responsible for these boys, regarding them as "customers rather than as
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0276"/>
<col>501</col>
<i>employ&#x00E8;s</i>." So that this young gentleman&#x2014;this <i>Gavroche</i> of the London streets&#x2014;works entirely on his own account.. He leads a life of constant excitement. What he goes through in dodging motor-omnibuses and taxicabs provides him on the physical side, no doubt, with very good exercise, but it also stimulates his feelings of excitement. He carries the materials of war for all the gambling in the streets, and he naturally wants to have a share in all those forms of excitement.. If he is within the school age I ask your Lordships what amount of attention you would expect a boy of your own to give to his lessons in similar circumstances when he is plotting the escapade of the evening, or thinking over what he carried in his last budget of evening papers? If he is past school age and its measure of control he bursts out into absolute independence just in those years which, as we all feel and as all our great social teachers of every kind impress upon us, are the most important years in life&#x2014;from the age of fourteen to seventeen or eighteen. The results of that pupilage can be seen very readily from these Reports; and though, no doubt, what he takes home does, in the case of a boy who is virtuous enough to resist all these temptations, sometimes help a poor home, it seems to me that we shall certainly be putting the less altogether before the greater if we make that a reason for perpetuating a system which is, on the whole, so entirely vicious.<lb/>
It is asked, If we prevent the boy from getting the pence or the shillings which he earns in this particular way can we secure that he will have anything else to do? About that the evidence appears to be a little conflicting, or various in different places. Surely this is one of the cases where we ought not to follow the line of least resistance. The line of least resistance is to say, The boy must have some money so let him earn it where he can. But the line of most resistance which in a matter of this kind ought to be followed, is to arrange, partly by public authority and partly by voluntary action, that more ways should be open for him. It strikes me that there is one way in which such employment would be found for him if we follow up, in a piecemeal system, the noble Earl's proposal by other proposals limiting the amount of work done in the earlier years after school time. Any such limitation of the hours of labour as, I
<col>502</col>
suppose, would certainly form part of any measure proposed by a responsible authority with regard to boys, with a view to industrial training and so on, would surely mean that the hours which those boys were thus obliged to drop out of their work would' remain available for the employment, of other boys; and, therefore, if this reform should prove to be imperfect in that. it does a little harm in certain cases to certain boys, I think that will in the long run only prove to supply an additional argument for going forward to those larger reforms for boys which we so earnestly desire and which authorities of every kind have agreed to be desirable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01128"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with interest to the speech of the noble Earl who moved the Second Beading of this Bill, and I did not intend to take any part in the debate until I heard the city of Leeds alluded to and a reference made to boys who sell evening newspapers in the afternoon. I think we shall all agree that the present age limit of eleven is too low, but whether we should be right to jump that age limit straight away to eighteen in the case of girls and seventeen in the case of boys I have my doubts. I do not wish to detain your Lordships more than a minute or two, but there are a few words to be said on the other side, and with your kind permission I will endeavour to say them.<lb/>
The noble Earl alluded, rightly, to the moral side of this matter, and said that the morality of boys and girls who trade in the streets suffers. There is no doubt a great deal in that. But is there not something even higher than the morality of the question? Is there not involved the power to live at all in these days when the pressure of life is so great? Most of us have lately had an opportunity of seeing in the newspapers interesting balance-sheets of families in London where the man, with a wife and five children, is earning 25s. a week&#x2014;by no means an unusual case. This balance sheet shows that never is the housewife able to spend as much as 3d. a day on the food of each individual member of the family, and if a new coat is wanted to keep the head of the household free from cold it has to come out of the food bill&#x2014;there is nothing else for it to come out of, and the food bill drops to less than 2d. per head. That brings home to us the enormous pressure of modern life, and we ought to be careful before we interfere in any way
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0277"/>
<col>503</col>
with the earning-power of such families as these.<lb/>
The newspaper boy I happen to know a good deal about. The boy who sells evening papers in the streets gets, as a rule, thirteen copies of the paper for 4&#x00BD;d. He sells them at a half-penny each, so that for every thirteen he disposes of he makes 2d. These newspaper boys do make a few pence per night by selling papers in the streets, and they make more if they are sharp. But there is a public demand for them&#x2014;though I do not put this consideration so high as that of not interfering with the earnings of very poor families&#x2014;and in big towns such as Leeds the public cannot easily get the papers except through the street sellers. I remember that years ago a well-known clergyman noted for his good work in Leeds&#x2014;Canon Bullock&#x2014;took great interest in this particular question. He came to me, as chairman for a great many more years than I care to think of a leading newspaper there. to ask if he might form a brigade of street boys to sell our paper. He thought that if the lads came under a certain amount of discipline it would be a good thing. We put out both hands to him, and asked him to help us in the matter. We did all we could to make life endurable for the boys and to look after them as far as we could, though it was a difficult job, and many of those boys were with us a long time selling our papers and were of great service to their homes. Therefore I think we should take these matters into consideration before we rush into legislation of this kind. I do not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. I know there are many good points in it; but there are many arguments on the other side. The evening paper question must be considered first of all from the food point of view, and, secondly, from the point of view of public utility and the manner in which the public are served in that way. Certainly I do not think it would be wise to jump the age from eleven to seventeen and eighteen all at once.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01129"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would beg your permission to make a few remarks on this subject which are the outcome of my own personal experience. During the time that I was connected with the Government of Ireland, no subject was more pressing, as far as the cities of Dublin, Belfast, and Cork were concerned, than this question of street trading. Many philanthropic people took it
<col>504</col>
up, and a proposal was made, on which there was complete unanimity of opinion, that it was most desirable to withdraw from the streets the children who were employed in the manner described this evening. But we were faced with this situation&#x2014;if the children were withdrawn from the streets and prevented from earning the small pittance which they used to earn, how were they to be provided for? The opinion was formed that nothing could be effectively done unless in those great towns day industrial schools could be established and the children when withdrawn from the streets taught a trade which would be afterwards useful to them and by which they might earn a livelihood. I was connected with the Irish Government for six years, and I left there, having taken up the question when I arrived, with the matter still unfinished. I would respectfully submit to the noble Earl that his scheme as it stands in the Bill will not be operative unless lie joins with it some means of providing employment and training for the children whom he is so desirous of taking off the streets. Otherwise his admirable scheme will, I fear, prove infructuous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01130"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire in the first place to congratulate my noble friend on the character of his remarks in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, and also on the evident feeling which lie displayed as to the profound evil with which he hopes to deal. As the right rev. Prelate has just said of the noble Earl, his undertaking of this particular subject and his introduction of it in such moving terms reminds one of the stock from which lie springs.<lb/>
There can be nothing more urgent than this question of the children. The right rev. Prelate has spoken of it in terms not too strong, and he has spoken from a wealth of personal knowledge of which, of course, I can claim no share, and I think there was nothing more important in the Report of the Poor Law Commission than what was said about the evils and difficulties of child labour. We have had several discussions on the subject in your Lordships' House, but hitherto they have been rather positive in their character than negative&#x2014;that is to say, rather in the direction of urging upon His Majesty's Government and Parliament the necessity of providing better avenues for the work
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0278"/>
<col>505</col>
of children than in preventing them from working altogether.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate has told us, on the authority of the Prime Minister, that piecemeal legislation is all that we can expect, and that we must not quarrel with the particular piece which we are first asked to digest. Nevertheless I cannot help thinking that we are attacking this subject somewhat the wrong way round, and that, if it were possible, it would be better to begin by providing better opportunities for the apprenticeship of boys and girls with a view to introducing them to healthy and wholesome employment than by saying to their parents, very poor parents in many cases, that their children shall not avail themselves of the only opportunities that they may have to work. Therefore I think we must approach this subject with very great caution. It is a very difficult thing to say to very poor people who absolutely depend upon the few pennies which their children earn that that source of supply should be cut off from them.<lb/>
Your Lordships must have listened with respect to what fell from my noble friend below the Gangway (Lord Faber) when he reminded us of the very narrow margin on which these poor families have to live. I am afraid I have no real knowledge of urban conditions and I do not profess to speak upon them, but I know what happens in the country. In the country there is one very difficult period in the life of the labourer. It is not when he first marries, but after the children have begun to come and before they have begun to earn&#x2014;that is the difficult moment. The labourer's wages, not very high I am sorry to say at any time, do not grow any larger because he has four or five young children to support as well as his wife and himself, and during the period when there are four or five or more young children and not one of them earning a halfpenny he is very hard put to it to find the rent, food, and clothing. But when the moment arrives that the eldest boy or girl begins to earn something there is immediate relief to that poor household. The 4s. a week becomes an immense boon, and as the next child goes to work the pressure is still further relieved. I do not say that this Bill will do so, but the tendency of the Bill with all its advantages will inevitably be to make the lot of such poor parents a little harder than it was before. I think I have said enough on that head to show that we
<col>506</col>
must approach the subject with the greatest caution, and not allow mere sentiment, however worthy, for the future of these children, to blind us to the other side of the-case.<lb/>
We shall have to consider before we part with this Bill whether, in the light of those considerations, my noble friend&#x2014;following, of course, the recommendations of the-Departmental Committee&#x2014;has not taken rather too extreme a view of the extent of change which there ought to be. He proposes to jump from the age of eleven, which is unduly low, up to the age of seventeen and eighteen. That may be right; I will not say at this moment it is not right; but certainly it is a very great change. Then I do not think we can shut our eyes to the fact that the Report of the Departmental Committee was not unanimous. The noble Earl in charge of this Bill did not in any way conceal that fact from your Lordships. Indeed, he mentioned it. We must bear in mind that there were several Members of Parliament and several representatives of the Home Office who reported against the views of the majority. That is an additional reason for proceeding with caution in the matter. It may be that we shall find, on consideration, that the majority have gone rather too far.<lb/>
Lastly, there are the details to which the noble Earl the First Commissioner of Works referred, and which will require very careful consideration. Among other difficulties the noble Earl alluded to certain difficulties in the countryside. The fact that in certain cases children who carry eggs and milk may come within the purview of this Bill as engaged in trading will require careful consideration. In the further observations which the noble Earl made he said lie saw no reason why the Government Department which is to administer this Bill should be the Board of Education rather than the Horne Office. Speaking straight off, I should like to say that in that respect I entirely agree with the noble Earl. I cannot understand on the face of it why it should be necessary to entrust to the Board of Education the administration of an Act which has nothing to do with education but has to do with the trading and general conduct of life of children. Subject to these reservations, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned we shall not oppose the Second Reading of the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0279"/>
<col>507</col>
Bill; but I think the noble Earl must be prepared for a good deal of further discussion at the later stages of the Bill, of which I hope he will be kind enough to give us good notice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01131"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is a good illustration of the hereditary principle and of the traditions connected with the noble Earl's name. I support the Bill very heartily. My experience at the School Board for London strongly impressed me with the necessity that there should be some agency when children leave school which is able to guide parents to secure for the children proper employment. It would be difficult to introduce that element in this Bill, but I am sure the noble Earl will agree that the necessary accompaniment of this Bill, which is prohibitive, should be the opening of new avenues leading to improved conditions of employment. That is, I understand, the aim of the London Juvenile Advisory Committee constituted by the Board of Trade, on which the Education Committee is represented. And before this Committee was constituted the Education Committee of the London County Council had established the machinery for carrying out the work appertaining to after-care and juvenile employment. I know the importance which the Government attach to this question, especially with regard to boy labour in the Post Office, and the Postmaster-General has lately issued instructions which will secure good employment to boy messengers in his Department. I refer to Cd. 5504. I shall not go into the details of this Bill with regard to the limits of age; those are details which can be dealt with in Committee. But on one point I wish to associate myself with what has been said by the noble Earl who spoke for the Government. I certainly think that the provision in Clause 2, directing that these children should be sent to a certified reformatory school, will require some alteration. We know that those who are most competent
<col>508</col>
to form an opinion on this matter&#x2014;the magistrates, remand officers, and police&#x2014;are all in favour of prohibiting street trading by children as a very demoralising influence, and I do not think that your Lordships can do otherwise than give a Second Reading to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01132"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF LONDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who has lived among the poor for so many years I must acknowledge the very touching&#x2014;and true&#x2014;speeches which have been made on both sides of the House with regard to the awful struggle of poor families to keep their heads above water. But there is another side to the matter, and those of us who know the inside of the lives of the poor are bound to remember how much the ranks of the unemployed and the hopelessly unemployable are fed by this class. When you have man after man coming before you for whom you are trying to get work and you ask, "What can you do?" and he replies, "I can do anything"&#x2014;that is the man who is your despair, for he can do nothing. The noble Marquess spoke of an appeal to sentiment. I feel that I have to resist sentiment in cases of this kind. In the case of a poor family my sentiment is to let the boy or girl continue street trading, but I have to correct my sentiment by my judgment and experience of what happens in after life. Therefore I think your Lordships should pass the Second Reading of the Bill to-night, and then apply your experience and brains to improving the Bill in Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INDIAN POLICE METHODS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01160"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for India whether the attention of the Government has been called to the cases of torture and extortion by the police recorded in the latest Annual Reports of the Inspector-General of Police in certain Provinces, resulting in more than one death of the tortured prisoners; and whether he has considered the opportunities for such cruelties offered by the provisions of the existing law authorising magistrates to
<col>512</col>
remit untried prisoners for considerable periods of time to the custody of subordinate policemen; and whether any steps are in contemplation, by an amendment of the law or otherwise, to discourage the practice so strongly condemned by the Report of the recent Police Commission of the police working for confessions in gross abuse of their powers; and whether the Government of India proposes to give effect to the express recommendation of the Commission that the investigation of charges brought against the subordinate police should be dealt with by the district magistrate or some such competent and impartial authority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01161">The noble Lord said: My Lords. I rise to address to my noble friend below me the Questions which stand in my name. I hope I shall not find it necessary to trouble your Lordships at any length, though the matter is one of painful interest. It has in former years occupied the attention of my noble friend, and I regret that on his reoccupation of office it should be necessary to bring it again before him. The Questions deal with the conduct of the police of India in the investigation of crime. Your Lordships know that in all countries and in all ages the police have been subjected to much criticism for their methods in investigating crime, and even in our own country, in spite of our advanced civilization, questions have been not infrequently raised with reference to the conduct of our police. I have known several successive Home Secretaries and I once had the honour of being Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, but I do not know a Home Secretary who has not been called upon at some time or another to shield or excuse the police under his control. As to the Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, no session passes without his having to defend the conduct of the police under his administration; and I need not speak of the criticisms habitually lavished on the police of foreign countries, especially those where there are not the personal liberty and security of justice which we enjoy. It would not be surprising, therefore, that in India there should be lapses from the standard which we cherish, and that criticism should now and then be expressed in regard to the conduct of the police there. It is inevitable that such lapses should happen, and it is not to be objected that criticism should be roused to direct attention to the shortcomings of the service with a view to its improvement.</p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0282"/>
<col>513</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01162">I do not want to go back any great distance of time, but some five or more years ago, when Lord Curzon was Viceroy of India, a Viceregal Commission reported on t he conduct of the police. At the head of that Commission was a very distinguished public official. Sir Andrew Fraser, Lieut.- Govern or of Bengal. The. Report is extremely painful reading, though Very creditable for thoroughgoing candour on the part of the members of the Commission. It shows that the ordinary investigation of crime, especially crime happening in a village community in the East, by the police of India affords a sorry spectacle. The Whole village is harried by the investigation that follows. A great body of police go down and occupy the area; all the population are sometimes summoned to attend upon them; the examination is very rude and rough; and, in the words of the Commission, bullying and threatening of suspected and innocent persons is very common. The ordinary policeman conceives that some person or other for some reason or other has been the perpetrator of the crime under investigation, and the method to which he is prone to resort, to which he is under temptation to resort should say, is that of threatening, bullying, and otherwise overawing the criminal, or supposed criminal, until he is led to a confession. Actual physical torture leaving marks behind it is rarely resorted to, but it is easy to conceive how in a village community in India a great deal of torture short of absolute physical torture may be perpetrated. The Commission go on to make the terrible statement that, if the police fail to get up evidence in that way, they frequently do not shrink from bolstering up perjured evidence in order to sustain a charge against a person whom they suspect of being guilty. As I say, actual resort to physical torture is not so common, hut illegal detention, neglect of the regulations with regard to the use of handcuffs, and general want of consideration for those who deserve every consideration until at least something has been done to prove them guilty, are ordinary characteristics of the conduct of the police according to this Commission. The Commission add that working for confession is a practice exceedingly common amongst the police of India.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01163">This was a Report made some five years ago, and we all hope that there have since been improvements. But, unfortunately, there is much evidence that even still not
<col>514</col>
merely the smaller processes of bullying and threatening but the actual graver processes of torture are not wholly extinct. I turn to the last Report of the Inspector-General of Police for Bengal&#x2014;the Report for 1909. He says that in that year there were seven cases alleged against the police of torture for the purpose of extorting confession. Three of them were unsustained and dismissed, in two cases there were convictions, and two remained under investigation. There were only two cases the year before, and seven may be an extraordinary number; but the fact that there had been two convictions and two eases remaining under investigation is in itself a painful fact. In the Report of the Inspector-General of Police for Madras I find reference to two cases in the same year-1909. One was a very grave case involving several police officials in the torturing of two or three prisoners for the purpose of extorting a confession, the torturing resulting in, or at all events followed by, the death of one of the tortured. In that case some of the police were sentenced to terms of rigorous imprisonment. That is one example of the terrible extent to which the practice may still be traced. There was another case in the same province&#x2104;Madras&#x2014;in which three constables were charged with torturing a man from whom they were extorting hush-money in order to save his being exposed to the penalties of a misdemeanour. In that case also the punishment inflicted resulted in death. There were two deaths in the Province of Madras in one year from this cause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01164">The Inspector-General of Police for the United Provinces states in his Report that torture has not been wholly eradicated from the United Provinces. The efforts of himself and his deputy inspectors have, he says, been directed towards eradication, but they have not been altogether successful. He quotes the opinion of magistrates and officers under hint with reference to the working for confession which prevails, and one magistrate goes the length of suggesting that confession should not be admissible in evidence at all. The latest Reports of the Inspectors-General of Police for Madras, Bengal, and the United Provinces all show that torture working for confession, which the Police Commission presided over by Sir Andrew Fraser found to be exceedingly common, has not ceased to exist. The number of cases may be relatively few, but there they are, and I do not think we can find much comfort
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0283"/>
<col>515</col>
in their being relatively few. The Inspector-General of Police for Bengal deprecates an accumulation of criticism on these details, and suggests that, after all, the number of cases is not very great, and that the offences proved against the police are comparatively slight in their character compared with the barbarities which are perpetrated between themselves by the members of the classes from whom the police are drawn. This is, your Lordships will confess, a very sorry apology, if it is to be an apology, for what exists. It is intelligible that an officer doing what is probably his best should chafe under criticism and that he should not like these black spots pointed out, but an official must bear criticism as best he can, and public criticism cannot be held back in so grave a matter as this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01165">The object of my Questions is to inquire, dative to the Report of the Viceregal Commission in 1905 and the Reports that have since been issued, whether my noble friend below me can give any statement as to what the Government have done to carry out the recommendations of the Commission, and whether they have considered any other ways of meeting the evils to which that Commission drew attention. The Royal Commission spoke of illegal detention. There is one mode of detention which is not illegal because it is permitted by the Indian Penal Code, but which still is of so questionable and doubtful a character that it may have been considered by His Majesty's Government. I venture to submit that it deserves consideration. There is a provision in the Indian Penal Code under which a man charged with a crime can be remitted by a magistrate who has not himself jurisdiction to try the prisoner to the custody of a police officer instead of being sent to prison or let out on bail to await the carrying on of the charge. There may be questions of convenience here and there in a country like India for not always sending an accused prisoner straight to prison, but manifestly the detention of an accused person by the investigating officer of police is opening the way to a great deal of malpractice, and it is worthy of consideration whether that provision should not be revised and perhaps rescinded. It is better if a man cannot be let out on hail to remit him to gaol rather than commit him to the care of the investigating officer, who is thereby placed in the temptation
<col>516</col>
to indulge in the objectionable practices to which I have referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01166">If we remember the extreme care in which we here guard the admission of statements made by accused, the almost superstitious way in which we fence round the accused to prevent his being led to make any statement which might injure his defence, safeguards which have been the result of experience of abuses in past generations&#x2014;if we remember all this I think there is grave ground for suspicion of the free admission of confessions in the case of prosecutions in India, and for, if not wholly denying the admissibility of confessions, at all events more rigidly safeguarding them from abuse and prescribing more strictly the conditions under which they should be admitted. The facility with which this practice of working for confession has been resorted to has often resulted in defeating itself. The man under arrest who is morally if not physically tortured to make a confession makes the confession, and from that time gets easier treatment till the time comes for the trial, and then he repudiates the confession and the case has to he begun again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01167">I have mentioned two things to which I think attention might be directed. There is a third, arising out of the Report of the Viceregal Commission. The standard of conduct in the investigation of crime in India, as elsewhere, differs when it is a judicial standard and when it is a police standard. We know quite well how much we owe in our own country to the action of Judges and magistrates in correcting the conduct of the police. Similar need is to be observed in Indian experience. The Viceregal Commission report that they had evidence of the disastrous consequences following from the neglect which had befallen the strictures which judicial persons had put on the conduct of the police in the investigation of crime, and the laxity of the attention which had been paid to them; and they recommend that, in the case of any prosecution for crime, where the presiding Judge or magistrate has reason to criticise the conduct of the police he shall make a careful note giving what has occurred, and shall forward it with his judgment to the proper district, where it should be made the subject of inquiry by a competent and independent authority. That is a matter of vital importance, and I hope
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0284"/>
<col>517</col>
my noble friend will be able to tell us what has been done in the way of carrying out that recommendation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01168">I have brought the history down to the year 1909, but even since then there has been a very painful case in which death has followed&#x2014;we know it only from the newspapers. The case was confirmed before the Supreme Court of Judicature in Bengal, the Chief Justice presiding, and police officers were convicted of torturing for the purpose a obtaining a confession. I hope, my noble friend will be able to give us, some hope that if, as is confessed, the working for confession by torture has not been eradicated, steps are being taken to reduce it to the smallest possible limits by the punishment of all persons detected to be in any way engaged in it, and the prompt bringing before an independent inquiry of all cases of alleged malpractices. I know the delicacy of this last suggestion which, however, was made by the Royal Commission. We all know that here and there charges arc brought against the police and calls made for independent judicial. inquiries into their conduct. If they were all entertained there would be endless cases of inquiry, and many of them would be found to be wholly unsustainable; but when serious cases are noted by magistrates in the carrying through of criminal prosecutions and representation is made to the proper authority, in such cases I think we ought to look for and expect, unless there is special reason to the contrary, some examination by an authority other than that of the police itself. There is small comfort in setting the police to investigate the shortcomings of the police. Where such serious cases as I have referred to exist proper inquiry should be made.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01169">I know there are considerations which have to be borne in mind. There is the low pay of the police as a body, and the low condition of preparation in education and in morality of the classes from whom the police of India are almost necessarily drawn. This is a difficulty which I admit might be overcome by a little more liberal expenditure of money. In any case we must look into it and see whether it cannot be improved. At present, undoubtedly, the police of India cannot be said to take a very high rank under any test of qualification. In Madras I find that, out of the ordinary constabulary, 48 per cent. are
<col>518</col>
absolutely unable to read or write. That, however, is a far less proportion than prevails in Bengal, where 64 or 65 per cent. are wholly illiterate; and that, again, is far outdone by the condition of the case in the United Provinces, where no less than 78 per cent. of the police are said to be illiterate. Even some of the officers, though not many relatively to the whole force, in Bengal and in the United Provinces are said to be quite illiterate. Something should be done to elevate the <i>status</i> of the lowest class of the police, because that status not only reflects upon the character and conduct of the lowest class but has produced, I am told, a difficulty in recruiting officers. It may be necessary to resort to some means, whether by increased pay or other processes I know not, of getting a superior class of persons to execute this important function of police investigation in criminal prosecutions in India. I beg to ask the Questions standing on the Paper in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01170"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I make no complaint whatever of my noble friend bringing this subject before your Lordships' House. For several years it was my business in another place to deal with complaints of the same purport, and I have never, either when I was concerned with Irish Government or during the five years I was at the India Office, made them a ground of complaint provided that the critics were sure of their facts and were fair in intention and purpose. I sometimes found in another place that those who were most severe in their criticisms were neither sure of their facts, nor, though fair, wholly unbiassed.<lb/>
An idea possesses certain minds that our government of India is essentially in nature arbitrary and capricious. That point of view I need not say I do not accept, and I do not suppose anybody in your Lordships' House for a moment accepts it. It is not true. It could not be true, because, after all, these gentlemen are Englishmen&#x2014;where they are not Scotsmen&#x2014;and have the same standards of what is just and right as we have in this kingdom. At the same time, I have never thought that it was good for the Government of India to be exempt from Parliamentary criticism. First of all, I think it is inevitable. Whatever we may do or say, opinion in this country will insist on making itself felt in any part of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0285"/>
<col>519</col>
the Dominions of the King. My noble friend has to-night shown no unfairness&#x2014;of that he is incapable&#x2014;no unfairness of intention, and such facts as he has brought to your Lordships' notice are reasonably sure, though they need interpretation. When it is said that the Secretary of State in dealing with criticisms and complaints is bound to rely upon the word of officials in India, I would observe that the frank&#x2014;perhaps over-frank&#x2014;nature of the Report of this Commission, which was composed mainly, if not entirely, of officials of the Government of India, is what my noble friend himself has relied upon. Therefore that particular point may be dismissed.<lb/>
I have no desire, and never have had a desire, to whitewash the Administration of India in the matter of criminal investigation. But, as my noble friend knows, such matters are extremely delicate, and more delicate in India, where you have a small governing class and a huge population alien from it in tradition, habits of mind, and habits of life. Criminal investigation in those conditions is eminently a very difficult matter to deal with. To illustrate the peculiar difficulties, I may mention that you are dealing with a population of 232,000,000 scattered over an area of 1,000,000 square miles, and you have dealing with this enormous area and population a total police force of 176,000 men controlled by about 530 superintendents and assistant superintendents, mostly, if not all, Europeans. It is plain, therefore. that you cannot apply to this handful of police scattered over an immense area the same standards that you would if you were sitting in Quarter Sessions.<lb/>
As to the practice of detention, I would like to inform the noble Lord and the House what the facts really are. My noble friend did not seem to be aware that the police now may under no circumstances keep anybody in their custody for more than twenty-four hours. Suppose, then, that the police wish for a remand. They have to apply to a magistrate and produce the accused man, and if the unfortunate man has been tortured, then is his opportunity to complain. He has nothing to do but to say to the magistrate, "I have been so pressed and bullied and threatened that I confessed." Let us go to the period of detention. The magistrate must record his reasons for granting a remand, and the aggregate of remands
<col>520</col>
must not exceed fifteen days. It is not an indefinite remand, and the magistrate is not empowered to grant the fifteen days remand at one stroke. Day after day, or every other day, they may get some new material, but at the end of fifteen days that process is over.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01171"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: As I understand, power is given to remit to the custody of the officer for fifteen days or less, but I do not understand that at the end of that fifteen days he may not get a fresh order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01172"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I understand not. At the end of the fifteen days the man must be brought on his trial before some Court. Further, this exercise of power to remand is zealously watched by the superior Courts. It is no interest of theirs that this power of remand should be abused in the way that I thought my noble friend was describing, and time tendency of their rulings has been to cut down the discretion of the magistrates in this respect. In the Punjab, for example, a standing order is issued for the guidance of the police, defining narrowly the grounds on which a remand should be applied for, discouraging applications on other grounds, and laying down positively that no application shall be made on the ground that an accused person is likely to confess.<lb/>
I now come to the point of confessions, which has no doubt greatly exercised humane and just opinion in some quarters in this country. The practice of working for confessions has been invariably condemned by the local governments in India, and the standing orders issued for the guidance of the police contain stringent injunctions against resorting to it. It must be borne in mind that the feeling about confession, or the conditions that surround the practice of getting confession, depend on Indian habits of mind&#x2014;habits of mind perfectly common in Europe as late as, shall I say, the sixteenth century. Machiavelli himself was subjected to torture in order to extort some confession from him. It is not an Indian peculiarity; it is a matter of old history with us. My noble friend may rest assured that efforts are constantly and stringently being made to eradicate the ingrained tendency to get at convictions through confessions. One of the things the Indian Government have done, on the recommendation of the Police
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0286"/>
<col>521</col>
Commissioner, is to establish training schools for the police, and signs of improvement have already been observed. I believe that 85 per cent. of the men going to these posts are from the public training school. They have a fair educational qualification to start with, they get special training at the school, and they pass an examination imposing practical tests of fitness.<lb/>
I would like the House to hear what the process really is. Under the Indian Evidence Act, no confession made to a police officer can be proved&#x2014;proved, that is, in the sense of being admissible as evidence&#x2014;as against a person accused of any offence. In order to make a confession admissible as evidence it must be recorded by a magistrate, and that magistrate must, when the accused comes before him, first direct the police to leave the premises and satisfy himself that there is no policeman to overawe the prisoner; and, secondly, he must question the accused as to whether he confesses of his own free will and must satisfy himself that that is the case. He must examine the body of the accused for marks of ill-treatment and record the result; he must ask the accused in detail how long and at what places he has been in the custody of the police, and, having done all this, he may then record the formal statement, "I believe that this confession was voluntarily made." Therefore it is not a case of its being summarily taken for granted that an accused man has made a confession.<lb/>
My noble friend referred to two cases in Madras of abuse by the police of their power and authority, and two in Bengal. It will be sufficient, I think, if I deal only with the Madras cases. The number of cases quoted was rather astonishing in view of the breadth of the charges that have been made and. the enormous generalisations that have been inferred from one or two isolated cases, and my noble friend must have been sensible that in this matter he was resting on a rather weak foundation. If this abuse by the police is so extensive as to demand the censure of your Lordships' House and of the country, he would have produced a sheaf of cases. The first of the Madras cases was the Godavari case. A station house officer and two constables were charged with causing grievous hurt to extort confession, and, further, with
<col>522</col>
wrongful confinement to extort confession, and the torture of three persons suspected of housebreaking, one of whom died from the effects of the injuries received. A sub-inspector, acting as inspector, was charged with abetting these offences. The Sessions Judge convicted the first three accused under sections dealing with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and the fourth under the section dealing with abetment. He sentenced the station house officer to six years rigorous imprisonment, the two constables to three and a half years each, and the acting inspector to three years. The decision of the magistrate was upheld by the High Court. The charge of murder was not sustained, as intention to cause death could not be proved. I submit that, whether in India or anywhere else, this is not a bad story. It is, of course, a bad story that the police should have used excessive force, but they were punished, and the punishment, I submit, was adequate and sufficient.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01173"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: I admitted the punishment. I do not wish to argue the case, but it is a bad case where several people are implicated in these proceedings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01174"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: It is certainly a bad case, but it is not a case which justifies the drawing of a great indictment against the whole police system of India. The other Madras case was the Jaypore case. Three constables were charged with the murder of a Domb, a member of a low caste, whom they had maltreated for evading the payment of hush money in connection with an irregular marriage in his house. The Sessions Judge, agreeing with the assessors, acquitted them of murder, but convicted them under Section 394 of causing hurt in committing robbery, and sentenced the first and second to ten and seven years transportation, and the third to two years rigorous imprisonment. On appeal the High Court set aside the convictions on the ground that the evidence was unsatisfactory, and observed that the accused had been properly acquitted of murder. They also said that their conduct in failing to report and to visit the spot, and in giving a false account of the cause of death gave rise to suspicion against them, and I suppose the Government of India will report to me the Depart-

<col>523</col>
mental action taken. It is grievous to read of this brutish treatment; but, even if there were twenty such cases, I should still think that in a population of 230,000,000 and with 176,000 police and 530 superintendents and assistant superintendents, it was not a thing to justify a wholesale sweeping condemnation of the whole police.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01176"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I should like to read the orders in the Central Provinces as to confession. "It is necessary to warn police officers," they run, "against the danger of unduly relying upon confessions or admissions made during the investigation of offences by persons suspected of their commission and of being thereby led to place before the Courts evidence which is of little value apart from the confession. Experience shows that a person guilty of a serious crime rarely gives an account of his acts and motives in accurate detail. Even while admitting the commission of the crime, he will resort to various devices whereby he hopes to lessen his criminality in the eyes of the Court," and so forth. Then as to the Punjab:&#x2014;"So far as may be possible"&#x2014;this is on the point of detention and remand&#x2014;"the investigation of a cognizable offence shall be completed within twenty-four hours of the arrest of the accused person. When, in the investigation of a cognizable offence, it is necessary to arrest the accused person at an early stage of such investigation, and it is apparent that such investigation cannot be completed within twenty-four hours of such arrest and it is not considered advisable to release the accused on bail, the police officer may apply to the nearest magistrate for a special order for further detention" on any one of the grounds which are set forth. What can a Government do more than fence round this practice of possible detention and moderately extended remand with restrictions of the kind described in these orders?<lb/>
My noble friend brought forward the question of increased pay. The recommendations of the Commission are well known. As much has been done as could be done in the time since the Report was made, and every effort has been made, I am assured, and I believe&#x2014;for I have carefully
<col>524</col>
watched this matter at the India Office&#x2014;every effort has been made to raise the education and <i>status</i>as well as the pay of sub-inspectors. The pay used to be from 30 rupees to 70 rupees a month, and is now from 50 rupees to 100 rupees; therefore we have gone a few inches, at any rate, on the journey my noble friend would wish taken.<lb/>
Language is sometimes used implying that the Government of India do not condemn this abuse of force, do not condemn torture and pressure, and the Government of India naturally disdain almost to reply to so monstrous a charge. In some quarters the demand is made for the issue of a declaration that they condemn and do not condone the practice, but everybody in the whole Service down to the humblest man knows perfectly well that the Government of India abhor the practice and do their best by punishment when there are good grounds to eradicate the practice. I am sure my noble friend would not for a moment say that the Government of India are capable of shall I say, winking at a general doctrine that torture might be resorted to when a man was given into the custody of the police.</membercontribution></p>

I have no desire to press my Motion for Papers if the noble Lord can satisfy me that there are no Papers which can conveniently be laid at the present time.

<col>527</col>
passed at the negotiations between Mr. Knox, Mr. Fielding, and Mr. Paterson, has been presented to Parliament in full, or with certain necessary omissions. Of these omissions I have to say that they are observations upon the United States and Canadian interests involved which in the opinion of His Majesty's Government it is not desirable to publish. The telegram from the Governor-General of Canada is published as a separate Paper [Cd. 55121]. His Majesty's Government do not propose to publish any further correspondence with the Governor-General of Canada.<lb/>
As regards the second part of the noble Lord's Question. I would point out that in formal negotiations begun only on January 10, 1911, there was nothing for Mr. Bryce to report upon until after that date. As negotiations with the United States Ministers arc within the competence of the Canadian Ministers&#x2014;which is not denied&#x2014;it would be most undesirable for His Majesty's Government to send separate instructions to Mr. Bryce. Between May, 1910, and January of the present year the
<col>528</col>
Colonial Office received despatches from the Governor-General at Ottawa, but they are not considered suitable for publication for the obvious reason that they may be presumed to be, and are, in the nature of confidential reports from the Governor-General upon various actions of his own Ministers and are not of the nature of official documents.<lb/>
As to the last of the three Questions in reference to "most-favoured-nation Treaties." the Governor-General has forwarded to the Secretary of State for the Colonies copies of Resolutions moved by Mr. Fielding in the Canadian Parliament providing <i>inter alia</i> that the advantages to be granted by the Reciprocity Agreement to the United States should be extended to any foreign Power which may be entitled thereto under the provisions of any Treaty or Convention with His Majesty.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TERRITORIAL FORCE MUSKETRY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01204"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War how many of the 180,724 men of the Territorial Army stated by him to have been tested in the musketry standard test on an open range failed to qualify.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01205">The noble Earl said: My Lords, before I put this Question to my noble friend I would like to preface it with a few remarks. The noble Lord, in reply to a Question which I addressed to him on February 27 last, explained that there are several arms in the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0291"/>
<col>531</col>
Territorial Force, such as Garrison Artillery and the Royal Army Medical Corps, who do not have to go through a course of musketry, and he proceeded to state that out of 195,585 men who were liable to do musketry, 180,724 had been tested in the standard test on an open range. There was a good deal of confusion in the minds of your Lordships as to what a standard test was, and my noble friend was asked a subsidiary question in regard to that by Lord Ampthill, and the reply he gave was that it was one and the same thing to have passed the standard test and to have fired a full course of musketry. It appears very clear that to pass the standard test does not entail qualification, still less efficiency. I do not wish to occupy your Lordships' time by quoting the musketry regulations; they are extremely intricate and difficult, and are very technical; and, after all, there are many cases over-ridden by the power given to the commanding officer to even change the musketry regulations as laid down. I should like to call your Lordships' attention to a reply given by the Secretary of State for War in the other House in response to Mr. Bennett-Goldney, the Member for Canterbury. The right hon. gentleman stated, a few days after our discussion in this House, that 68,673 men of the Territorial Force had not qualified, as against 126,912 who had done so. That gives a totally different impression from that which was left upon the minds of your Lordships when the matter was discussed in this House, because, according to the Secretary of State's figures, one in three of the total Force have failed to qualify. That is the reason why I ask my noble friend to give the information set forth in my Question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01206"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the actual figures for which the noble Earl asks are as follow: 180,724 men were tested on an open range; of these, 126,912 qualified, leaving 53,812 who failed in the standard test. But, of course, there were a certain number&#x2014;24,460&#x2014;who, although they failed in the standard test, did qualify under the alternative methods provided for, in the Regulations. If I may be allowed to do so, I would like to make one or two remarks on the general question of the musketry test.</membercontribution></p>

The number of those who were tested is, as I have said, 180,000; out of that number, 53,000 failed; and if you add those two figures together&#x2014;the 53,000 who failed and the 15,000 who were not tested&#x2014;they give, I think, the figure which my right hon. friend mentioned in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01209"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: How many did the noble Lord say were unable to compete at all</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01210"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I said roughly 15,000. There has been this year very general improvement in the musketry of the Territorial Force. An altogether higher standard has been reached, and it has been reached by very much larger numbers than was the case this time last year. That has been due partly to greater efforts on the part of the officers and men concerned, partly to the efforts we have made to acquire additional ranges, and partly to the fact that we have provided and are providing a considerable number of 30-yards ranges and miniature ranges. But we are very slow, I am sorry to say, in getting new ranges. A considerable number are still required, and we are engaged in the acquisition of ranges at the present moment. Their acquisition, however, is difficult. There is difficulty, in the first instance, in finding a site, and then the process of acquisition is very slow.<lb/>
With regard to the standard test itself, the figures constitute a useful guide, but I think it would he a mistake to attach too much importance to them. And for this reason. The considerable number of failures to pass the standard test are due, first, to lack of range accommodation, and, secondly, to lack of opportunity. In a great many cases in places where there are a large number of units of the Territorial Force we have range accommodation for everybody; the accommodation, however, is in some cases crowded, and it becomes
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0292"/>
<col>533</col>
necessary to tell off to units certain days when they may have the use of the range. In those circumstances it very often becomes necessary to lay down that the standard test shall be fired on a certain day for a particular unit. If a man, for any reason, is prevented from going to the range to be tested on that day, he has to be returned as inefficient, though he may have gone through the whole of his preliminary musketry and be able to pass the standard test easily.<lb/>
The same thing applies with regard to the conditions under which tests are very often fired. There have been many cases where very bad weather conditions have existed on the day when the test was fired and caused a very bad result. One very striking instance of that came to my notice. In one of the Northern Divisions there is a battalion which, according to the view held by the officer commanding the Division, is probably far the best battalion at musketry in the Division. The battalion takes particular pains with its musketry; it puts all its men through a very careful progressive course of training, and towards the end of the season it puts them through the standard test. Last year that battalion came out the worst of the whole twelve battalions in the Division, and that was simply owing to extremely bad weather. There is another reason why you cannot altogether go by the standard test. In the case of one battalion, for which we have not yet been able to obtain range accommodation, it was arranged last year that they should do their musketry in camp. They went into camp, but the officer in command, finding that he would not have time to put the whole of the battalion through the whole course, including the standard test, did not put any of them through the standard test. Nevertheless, he took them through a considerable amount of musketry; they fired between 30,000 and 40,000 rounds of ammunition; yet they had to be returned as not one single man having qualified in the standard test. I give these instances to show that, although the standard test is a useful guide, you cannot take the figures simply as they stand, without any qualification whatever, as at all a fair standard of what the musketry of the Territorial Force is. We are not the least satisfied ourselves yet, and we are making all the efforts we can to provide further range accommodation&#x2014;open ranges, 30-yards ranges, and miniature ranges.
<col>534</col>
I am sure that the chief thing that is the matter with the musketry of the Territorial Force is lack of accommodation, and that is a deficiency which will put itself right, I hope, in a short time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01211"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may be allowed to say a word or two on this important subject before we leave it. I should like to add my own experience to what has fallen from the noble Lord opposite. Two of the great difficulties which the Territorial Force have to face with regard to musketry are lack of ranges and lack of opportunity to use them, and one reason for that lack of opportunity is the crowded nature of the ranges and the difficulty of allocating time to the various units that have to fire on particular ranges. In my own county we have had at least one range&#x2014;I think two&#x2014;condemned. That means that the units which use those ranges have to make other arrangements, and fresh arrangements are not made without considerable difficulty.<lb/>
I think everybody will admit that the country has a right to have a sufficient and efficient standard of musketry, and it will be the duty of those who are interested in the Territorial Force to do what they can to see that that standard is reached. But there is one thing that ought to be borne in mind. It has been continually thrown in our teeth that a very large number of the Territorial Force never fired a shot at all last year. In ninety-nine cases out of every hundred that has been due to the fact that there has been no opportunity to fire. The General Officer commanding the Northern Command complained a good deal of the standard of musketry and pressed very strongly the benefit of week-end camps. I do not know whether the noble Lord has considered the possibility of encouraging week-end camps. Our own experience has been that where we have been able to avail ourselves of them the result has been very satisfactory. In one case a company which I could name got eighty per cent. of full marks after two days at the range at a weekend camp. But we have found that what is necessary to supply these camps is not always forthcoming, and that when application has been made there has been great difficulty in supplying the units with what is necessary for these week-end camps. The matter is of great importance. I do not ask for any additional grant, for we all
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0293"/>
<col>535</col>
recognise that the War Office and the Exchequer have treated us very generously this year.<lb/>
There is another difficulty with regard to week-end camps. It is that when men go down on a Friday and shoot on the Saturday and, where the conditions are favourable, on the Sunday, a good deal of objection has been taken to Sunday firing. If my historical education is correct, there was a time, in the days of the bow and arrow, when young men in the parishes were fined if they did not shoot on Sundays. When it is remembered that arrangements are made for attending Church Parades in the mornings, I think there should be consideration shown to these men in their endeavour to perfect themselves in what is, after all, an essential part of their training.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01212"><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War whether open ranges include 30-yards ranges. The noble Lord mentioned a certain number of men who became qualified in musketry by means alternative to the standard test. Does that allude to men who fire a certain number of rounds, and, irrespective of the result of their practice, become qualified?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01213"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: We use the term "open range" as meaning the full-size range, not the 30-yards range. With regard to the noble Duke's second question, he will find the whole thing in Paragraph 361 of the Territorial Force Regulations, which gives an alternative for the purpose of qualifying for the grant. The alternative is&#x2014;
<quote>"One attendance at an open range for the purpose of firing the practices of the standard test, and in addition two attendances at an open, miniature cartridge, or 30-yards range, provided that not less than 50 rounds of ball ammunition or the equivalent value in miniature ammunition have been expended during the year."</quote>
There is a further alternative in the case of recruits, the first provision of which is for the purpose of coaching the bad shot, and the second for the purpose of dealing with those cases where there is lack of range accommodation. With regard to what the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, said, I should like to say that we are very much in favour of week-end camps for the purpose of musketry, and the grants given which can be applied to those and other purposes have been considerably increased this year.</membercontribution></p>

In reply to the noble Earl's second Question, I am glad to be able to inform him that the additions to the list will in future be published quarterly. It is only right for me to say in this respect that when these publications take place, either by Return or reply to Questions in the House, the fact does not absolve in any way intending investors from getting sanction from the Public Trustee. As the result of the answer given in another place on July 6 last year a great many trustee investors seemed to think that they were absolved from the necessity of obtaining permission, and I only mention that this is not so in order to bring the matter to the notice of the public. The

noble Lord on the Cross Benches (Lord Oranmore and Browne) will, I am sure, readily understand that I am not in a position to answer his question off-hand, but I will undertake to see that his suggestion is brought to the notice of the public Department concerned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TERRITORIAL FORCE ABSENTEES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01217"><member>LORD NEWTON</member> rose to ask the. Under-Secretary of State for War how many officers and men respectively were absent from camp in 1910 without leave, and whether any penalties were imposed upon such absentees.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01218">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in putting this Question perhaps it may be as well if I convert it into sense by explaining that the words "Territorial Force" have been omitted, and that my inquiry relates to that branch of the Service only. I gather that the number of officers and men absent without leave during last year amounts to a somewhat large figure. Unless I am mistaken, the number is 700 officers and over 10.000 men, which forms a not altogether inconsiderable proportion of the entire Force. Absence without leave is. I believe, considered a serious military offence. It certainly is not less serious in the case of this particular Force than in that of any other, because&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;every care is taken to put the individual to as little inconvenience as possible. I am aware that there are regulations which deal with this offence, but, so far as I am able to gather, in practice the method of dealing with this offence is, as a rule, left to the discretion of the commanding officer, and the result, as I understand, is something in this nature. If the man who has absented himself without leave does not happen to be a resident in the district he is given up more or less as a bad job and no steps are taken to endeavour to find him and punish him. But in the case of a man who resides in the neighbourhood, if he is proceeded against he immediately becomes an object of sympathy. The result is that the practice of prosecuting men for this offence tends to promote unpopularity for the Force. I think it will be admitted that this is a somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs; and in view of expressions which I seem to remember which were made use of sonic years ago as to the relentless and remorseless way in which efficiency would be insisted upon, I think I am justified in

<title>RIGHTS OF WAY BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01260" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01261">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01262"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the history of this Bill in the other House is, I think, a conspicuous illustration of the congestion of business there, and of the almost total impossibility for a measure of this kind, a measure of a non-party character, in the hands of a private Member, to pass that House. The Society for the Maintenance of Public Rights over Commons and Footpaths, of which I am Chairman, has for the last seven years endeavoured in vain to pass this measure through the other House. On three occasions it was read a second time, twice without a division, and the third time by a majority of something like twelve to one, only thirteen Members voting against it. Twice it went through Grand Committee with considerable discussion and with sonic very small Amendments, but on each occasion it passed through Committee so late in the session that it was not possible to get it through its further stages. It received the support of lawyers on both sides of the House, and not a single lawyer spoke against it; that, I think, considering how very easy it is for lawyers to pick holes and disagree with one another, is a very remarkable thing. Last year and this year, although fifteen Members joined in the ballot, they failed to get precedence for the Bill in the other House.<lb/>
In these circumstances I have ventured to introduce the Bill into this House. Some of my friends think that that might be somewhat dangerous, but I have assured them that, in my belief, your Lordships on a Bill of this kind, which is of a non-party character and deals with a matter where public rights to some extent conflict with private interests, will be quite as unbiassed and disinterested as the other House, and I feel certain that you will give the Bill your best attention. Indeed, when I look back upon the many measures which I have proposed and carried in Parliament relating to commons and analogous subjects, I recall with satisfaction that the most radical of them was one which was first introduced in this House at my instance by the late Lord Thring. It was opposed by the then Leader of the Party opposite, who denounced it as a measure of confiscation; but, notwithstanding that, it received the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0298"/>
<col>545</col>
support of the majority of your Lordships' House and was passed into law. Compared with that measure, the one which I am asking your Lordships to read a second time to-day is a mere fleabite, and, therefore, I have very great hopes that your Lordships will be able to agree to it.<lb/>
The necessity for the Bill arises in this way. The point is not a long or a very technical one, and I shall not have to detain your Lordships at any great length about it. The law of England and of Ireland, differing from the law of Scotland and from the law of most other countries of Europe, rests the right of the public to a way or footpath, not upon user, but upon dedication. The footway must be dedicated, either by actual dedication or by user from which dedication is presumed. It is also the undoubted law that a tenant for life of a property under a family settlement or by entail cannot dedicate a right of way to the public. There are many things he can do. He can lay out roads for building purposes near a town, but he cannot dedicate a right of way in a rural district to the public. I need hardly remind your Lordships that a great part of the land of this country is held under family settlements, successively renewed in such a manner that for many years past nobody has been in a position to dedicate a right of way to the public. It follows from this that many cases have arisen in which evidence of user is produced in support of the rights of way extending over forty or fifty years, as long as the memory of man can go back but where family settlements, or some other disability, have existed for a still longer period, and there is no proof of dedication before the commencement of such family settlement. In cases of this kind I find that Judges disagree. In many cases Judges have laid down that, where evidence of user does not go back further than the family settlement or entail, the right of the public cannot be maintained.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord opposite, the Lord Chief Justice, in a case where evidence of user was produced of an undoubted character extending over fifty or sixty years, but where the property was held in family settlement for upwards of 150 years, and, therefore, there was no person during those 1.50 years to dedicate the right to the public, laid down that in that case the public right could not be maintained, and his ruling has been followed in many cases and in an
<col>546</col>
increasing number of cases of late years. On the other hand, there have been not a few cases where Judges have taken a different view. There was a case tried before the late Lord Justice Chitty some fifteen years ago, where evidence of user was produced extending over fifty or sixty years. It was contended, on the part of the landowner, that the land had been entailed by Act of Parliament as far back as the reign of Queen Anne, and that consequently there was nobody since then who could have dedicated the right of way to the public. It was argued, therefore, that according to the Lord Chief Justice's ruling the public right could not be maintained. The Judge, however, in that case brushed aside the objection, and said that where the evidence went back as far as the memory of living man extended he would presume that it went back even further, as far back as William the Conqueror if necessary, in order that the right of the public might be maintained.<lb/>
The example of Lord. Justice Chitty has been followed by other Judges. It may be said, therefore, that at the present time there is a great variety of action on the part of Judges. Nobody exactly knows what will happen at the trial of such cases. One bad effect is that local authorities, who are charged with the duty of maintaining rights of way under sections of the Local Government Act of 1894 for which I myself was personally responsible, are unwilling to maintain those public rights lest family settlements should be sprung upon them and the verdict should go against them and they should be mulcted in costs, which would fall on the shoulders of the ratepayers. The result is that many footpaths of great value to the public have been lost in this way, and also many footpaths which ought to have been enforced by the local authorities have been practically abandoned.<lb/>
I should like to give your Lordships an illustration of what happens in the present uncertainty of the law. There was a case in one of the southern counties of England of a bridle-path which was very much appreciated by the whole neighbourhood as it was the only bridle-path which gave access to very fine open down country to which riders were fond of going. A gentleman bought a small property which was crossed by the way, and finding that the bridle-way cut his property into two he
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0299"/>
<col>547</col>
was anxious to put an end to it. He could not do so, however, in respect of his own property because it had been held in absolute ownership for a great many years, and there was no doubt whatever that user by the public in that case would have held good. He therefore bought from the incumbent of the parish, through the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, a few acres of the glebe through which the bridle-way also ran, and he then maintained that, inasmuch as the incumbent of a parish is only tenant for life and in the same position as a tenant for life under an entailed property, he could not dedicate the property and that therefore there was no possibility of this bridle-path ever having been dedicated to the public by the successive incumbents who were owners of the glebe. Having bought the glebe he closed the bridle-way and caused very great indignation throughout the district.<lb/>
A local inquiry was held by the district board, and it was proved beyond all question that for fifty or sixty years the public had used this bridle-way. The bridle-way passed over the land of a noble -Duke, a member of this House, who wrote to the district board stating that in his view it was a public way, that he had always recognised it as such, and that he wished it to remain open. As I have said, the evidence was conclusive on the point that for fifty or sixty years it had been used by the public without any interruption, and there was no evidence whatever to the contrary. But the district board were informed by their lawyer that the question of law arising upon the point whether dedication could be presumed in such a case was so uncertain that he could not advise them to maintain legal proceedings for the purpose of vindicating the right of the public. Accordingly no proceedings were taken by the district board, and the bridle-path was therefore closed to the public. Upon that six of the neighbouring landowners signed a strong protest which they published in the local papers. I will venture to read an extract from it because it gives a justification for the Bill which is now before your Lordships. Tins is what they said&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr.&#x2026; having purchased the glebe, claims to be in a position to obstruct the bridle way, and to say to the public, who have used it openly and freely as long as the oldest inhabitants can recollect, You shall no longer use this bridle way.' We can see that until the law is altered to safeguard the public from such legal technicality, it might
<col>548</col>
not be possible to succeed in a legal action against this gentleman; but surely he cannot fail to admit, after having heard the unanimous evidence so unreservedly given at the inquiry by men of honour and repute, that there had been an uninterrupted use for so many years, that the moral victory remains with the petitioners. This is just one of those cases where a landowner can, by relying on a single and technical legal point, suddenly deprive the public as well as those who ought to he his friends and neighbours of a right which has existed probably from time immemorial."</quote>
I could quote other cases of the same kind. I have been surprised myself at the cases of this nature which have occurred. In these circumstances we feel that a change in the law is absolutely necessary.<lb/>
I may remind your Lordships that the law such as I have described it used to be the law with regard to private rights of way and other easements over property in favour of an adjoining property. But in 1832 the Prescription Act was passed which altered the law and provided, as against owners of property held absolutely, that twenty years' user of the private right of way or easement would be sufficient and conclusive, and, as against a tenant under an entailed estate or a glebe owner, that forty years' user would be sufficient. What we propose by this Bill is to copy the Act of 1832 and apply it to public rights of way as well as to private rights of way; and if your Lordships assent to this measure, then twenty years' user as against property held absolutely without entail or family settlement will be sufficient. to give to the public a right of way, and in the case of limited estates or estates under disability of any kind forty years' user will be sufficient. That, in fact, is very much the law of Scotland at this moment, with some trifling differences which it is not worth while noticing. For in Scotland there is no presumption of dedication. Rights of way there depend wholly on user, and user for forty years is sufficient to give the public a right.<lb/>
I do not think it will be necessary for me to describe at further length the details of this Bill. It is a comparatively short one, and if your Lordships agree to the Second Reading there will be in Committee full opportunity for discussing the details. But I should like to say a few words before I sit down as to the value of footpaths. I think everybody must agree that as the population of this country increases, so the value of footpaths becomes greater. Still more so is that the case at the present
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0300"/>
<col>549</col>
time, when motors and traction engines, motor-cycles and bicycles have invaded the country roads throughout the whole of the country and have destroyed a great part of their charm. For my part I have lost all pleasure in walking on the rural roads in my district, and I only feel pleasure in rural scenery when I get off the road on to a footpath. Fortunately a whole net- work of footpaths exists all over the country. I think very few people have any idea of the number of footpaths which exist.<lb/>
During the last few years the society to which I have referred has been appealed to in many cases, both by landowners and local authorities, to arbitrate between them as to footpaths existing upon properties. In one case&#x2014;that of the Chequers Estate, in the county of Buckinghamshire, consisting of 3,000 acres&#x2014;the owner appealed to the society, with the consent of the local authority, to arbitrate as to the footpaths on his property, and the society, through its officer, held a local inquiry on the subject. While rejecting some of the footpaths which were claimed, we decided that no fewer than thirty-six footpaths were legitimate and were to be affirmed in existence. In the same manner in many other parts of the country we have held arbitrations upon the existence of footpaths. Of course these decisions are not legal in this sense, that they are not final; but when local authorities and landowners agree to accept them they may practically be considered as final decisions. In this way we have arbitrated in regard to footpaths on about 500 square miles in five different counties, and in respect of these 500 square miles we have decided that something like 3,000 footpaths exist. If that be the proportion throughout the whole country, there must be something like 300,000 footpaths in England and Wales. Whatever the number may be, however, I think we may take it for certain that they are very highly valued by the people in the various districts.<lb/>
Every local authority almost without exception in the country has petitioned in favour of this Bill. Such associations as the County Councils Association, the Rural District Councils Association, and others of the same kind, after careful inquiry, have petitioned in favour of the Bill, and I think I may say that every local authority in the country is in favour of it. I venture,
<col>550</col>
therefore, to think that your Lordships will do well to accept the views of local authorities throughout the country. For my part I believe that your Lordships could not do a more popular act than pass this Bill and put an end to those technicalities which threaten the existence of many of the footpaths throughout the country. I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I have frequently observed, not only here but in another place, that when a measure of this kind is brought forward it is generally represented as being a perfectly harmless and colourless measure which is going to do an immense amount of good, but which, nevertheless, is going to leave everything in exactly the same position as before, and nobody is going to be inconvenienced in the slightest degree. In full accordance with this practice I observed that the noble Lord referred to this particular Bill as a fleabite&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01265"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: Only in comparison with the other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01266"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: Quite so. I should like to point out that this measure, estimable no doubt though it is, is not so insignificant as the noble Lord would desire us to believe. I may say that I have no intention of offering opposition to this Bill, for one excellent reason&#x2014;namely, that I personally have always taken particular care not to put any obstruction in the way of the public in this matter, because I know very well that if I did I should only get the worst of it. But I should like to point out that, however colourless and insignificant this measure may be, it is, I believe, the first occasion on which an owner is presumed not to enjoy full rights in his land unless he can show that he has not parted with those rights in favour of the public. It might be extremely difficult to bring evidence to negative any intention of dedicating
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0301"/>
<col>551</col>
a right of way, and quite conceivably it might he necessary to prove interference with a right of access.<lb/>
If we are going to admit this somewhat important principle, which, after all, is a new departure, it is essential that there should be certain safeguards. It seems to me quite clear that an owner at all events should have knowledge beforehand of the possibility of such a right arising against him. Therefore I think it is obvious that this Bill ought not to apply to land which is held under current leases, because the owner, naturally not anticipating legislation of this kind, in all probability has never guarded against the chances of the tenant allowing public access to his land, knowing that in consequence of the inaction of his tenant under the present law no right could accrue against him. It ought also, I think, to be made perfectly plain that an owner must have been in effective possession of his land before an intention to dedicate can he presumed, because it is quite conceivable that there might be intervals between the termination of the leases in which a man might. be in technical possession. The justice of the Amendments which I have suggested was recognised by the Committee of the House of Commons which considered the Bill, I think two sessions ago, on which the Government were represented in the proportion of something like four to one, and these alterations were accepted without any discussion at all.<lb/>
But I really have risen to point out a matter which I observed the noble Lord did not allude to at all in the course of a somewhat lengthy speech. I desire to draw particular attention to Clause 5 of the Bill. I suppose the noble Lord will tell me that this, like the Bill, does not mean anything in particular. If that is so, I shall certainly move to leave out the clause when we go into Committee. But as 1 read the clause, it appears to me to be perfectly plain that it is intended to deprive an owner of all rights over his land except, of course, such as are enjoyed by the general public, and to leave him the liability for repairing the road or highway or whatever it may be that has become public property. Otherwise the clause seems to me meaningless. And, in addition to that, surely under this clause a man would not only be liable for the upkeep and the maintenance of what he used to
<col>552</col>
believe was his own property but has become the property of the public, but he would be liable for any accident which might occur in consequence of his neglect. I should like to put this analogy to the noble Lord. It seems to me precisely on a par with this. I, out of my good nature, lend the noble Lord my watch. The noble Lord, having had my watch for a certain period, mines to me and says, "In consequence of your action your watch now belongs to me, but, although it belongs to me, it will be your duty to wind it up and to keep it in repair, and if it goes wrong I shall send the bill in to you; and if any unfortunate accident should occur through the watch not keeping time I shall sue you for damages." That seems to me common-sense interpretation of this clause, and certainly unless I get a better explanation of it when the Bill goes into Committee I shall move to leave the clause out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01267"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to offer any opposition to the Second Reading of this Bill, but I. wish to make a few remarks with regard to it. I am sure that no one in this House wishes to interfere with existing footpaths, nor in any way to curtail the rights of the public. On the other hand, I think it is our duty to look at the language of the Bill very carefully, and not to admit rights <i>per incuriam</i> and without having considered what we are doing. I must say that, like my noble friend Lord Newton, I was very glad to hear the confidence which the noble Lord who has moved the Second Reading of this Bill places in this House. It appears that some of his friends who. I suppose, have no experience of this House, believe this House to be a very unfair body of legislators; but my noble friend, having some experience, knows us better, and has, therefore, very wisely introduced this Bill here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01268"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: I was referring to when the Bill was in the hands of private Members.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01269"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord said that some of his friends had told him that he was doing a very risky thing in introducing the Bill into your Lordships' House, but he said he believed this House would give it careful and impartial consideration, and it was in regard to that remark that I was
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0302"/>
<col>553</col>
expressing my entire agreement with him. The noble Lord spoke of the Bill as referring almost exclusively to settled property, but it does a great deal more than that. He did not call attention to some of the main features of the Bill. But before I go to that, let me point out that this Bill, if it passes into law&#x2014;and I do not see why it should not&#x2014;is very likely to have a different effect from what the noble Lord expects. In the first place, when. an owner who has allowed people to pass through his park or go along footpaths sees that if he allows this for twenty years he is presumed to have dedicated the path to the public, he will be inclined to be rather more chary of giving permission than he has been up to the present time. And whatever owners might do, it would be absolutely the duty of trustees to stop all these ways which, if they allowed them to continue for forty years, would enable the public to claim rights to the footpaths.<lb/>
With regard to the Bill itself, if your Lordships will look at Clause 2, you will see a provision that "where any way"&#x2014;it is not limited at all to settled property and there is no reference to the fact that it is supposed to be or claimed to be a right of way&#x2014;
<quote>"where any way&#x2026;has been actually enjoyed by the public without interruption for a full period of twenty years, such way shall be al to have been dedicated as a public highway."</quote>
In the first place, what is the meaning of the words "actually enjoyed by the public without interruption "? Those words are taken from the Act of 1832, and although drafting may not be very good at the present time, yet in those days words which were not very precise were much snore freely used than now. Then if the noble Lord will turn to Clause 6, he will see that in applying the words to Scotland he uses much more precise terms. He says this&#x2014;
<quote>"There shall be deemed to be a right of public way upon or over land or water wherever there has been a use of such way by the public as a matter of right., continuously and without interruption, for a full period of twenty years."</quote>
Those words are clear and perfectly definite. It must be shown, not merely that a person has used a path, but that he has used it as a matter of right and could not be prevented from going over it by any one, also that he had used it continuously and without interruption. As the Bill now stands, the full period of twenty years
<col>554</col>
might mean any twenty years in the last hundred years. There is no provision fixing the period of time in which the twenty years occur.<lb/>
Then in Clause 3 I find this provision&#x2014;
<quote>"In the case of any way which previously to the passing of this Act has been decided by a competent Court not to be a public highway, this Act shall not apply except as from the date of such decision."</quote>
What does that mean? I really do not understand. Does it mean that the Court having decided that the right of way does not exist, the right of reviving that action has to commence again after the date of the judgment; or what does it mean? I should have thought that if the clause had stopped at the words "this Act shall not apply" that would have been the right thing to do. Clause 5 appears to me, if it has any meaning at all, to be very dangerous. It provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this Act shall he construed as having the effect of imposing on the council of any county, county borough, or district., or any other highway authority, any liability for the repair of any road which they would not have been liable to repair if this Act had not been passed."</quote>
At the present time there is no liability on any council of any county or county borough or district to repair any one of these roads. Why is it necessary to put in the Bill a statement to the effect that they are not liable? If they were called upon to repair one of these roads, then would be the time for them to object; but by putting in these words you infer that there is somebody else who is legally liable, and the natural inference would be that the owner whose path was taken was to be held liable. At all events it would be a sufficiently good argument for any counsel that as the council was not liable therefore the owner must be. Really the Bill, as far as I can understand, would be exactly the same if this clause were not in it. I have said all that I wish to say to your Lordships on this occasion. No doubt my noble friend will consider the matter before Committee, and will either propose Amendments himself or accept Amendments proposed by other noble Lords concerning these points.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01270"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNG WORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only interpose for a few moments in this debate. If this Bill would have the effect of settling a very vexed question it certainly ought to pass into law, because, as the House is aware, nothing gives greater cause of offence in country districts than disputed rights of way, and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0303"/>
<col>555</col>
there is no more fruitful cause of quarrel amongst neighbours. At the same time I venture to think that this Bill requires extremely careful consideration, and that there are various Amendments which might with advantage be introduced into it. Many of them, of course, require very careful legal consideration, but perhaps as a mere layman I might point out one or two things which your Lordships might think worthy of consideration.<lb/>
Clause 2 lays down that a way shall be deemed to have been dedicated as a public highway "unless it shall appear that there is sufficient evidence arising during that period negativing the intention to dedicate such way," and those words are repeated a little lower down. It has always been a moot point how this evidence can be satisfactorily produced&#x2014;that is to say, evidence that a man has no intention of dedicating a public way. It is sometimes held that the closing of a gate or a barrier once or twice a year will have that effect, but occasionally that is denied. There may be no gate or barrier to close in a particular case, and the construction of a new barrier might give rise to great objection and possibly to rioting. If an Amendment could be introduced into this Bill&#x2014;it is, of course, difficult because we are dealing with a negative&#x2014;defining some method by which it could be made clear by an owner that he had no intention of dedicating such a way, great good would be done and a difficult point would be cleared up.<lb/>
Then in Clause 3 there is the provision that&#x2014;
<quote>"in the case of any way which previously to the passing of this Act has been decided by a competent Court not to be a public highway, this Act shall not apply except as from the date of such decision."</quote>
I should like to know whether the term "competent Court" would apply to a local authority. In the Memorandum prefixed to the Bill a good deal is said about the duty and action of local authorities in this matter. I have in my mind at the moment a case of a disputed right of way where a man was turned off a certain path of which he claimed to have the right of user. He was turned back and there was a dispute, the matter being subsequently referred to the local authority. The local authority appointed a sub-committee to inquire into it, and after a quite dispassionate inquiry they decided that there was not a right of way here and that the man was in the wrong. Whether technically the local authority
<col>556</col>
were competent to decide the question I do not know, but it seems to me that a decision of that sort one way or the other ought to be taken into consideration at all events as going a long way to settle the matter once and for all.<lb/>
Speaking generally, I think great care should be taken to prevent going too far in the way of asserting public rights of way over property. of reviving doubtful rights, and of maintaining that the public have a right of way when the thing has not been clearly established. Such action might seriously interfere with a housing or town-planning scheme. For instance, I know a case where a friend of mine purchased a piece of land and proceeded to build a house upon it. Nothing was said by anybody. The house was nearly completed when, at the last possible moment, the local authority suddenly sprung a mine upon this unfortunate person and said there was a public right of way going, if not actually through the house, within five or six yards of it. It was a serious matter, almost necessitating the contemplation of pulling the house down. It is only right, however, that I should say that there were no building by-laws in that district, and that therefore the erection of the house did not come before the local authority in the first instance. But that does not alter the hardship occasioned. Negotiations took place, and a neighbouring landowner who was concerned indirectly came to the rescue and ultimately the matter was settled. I merely quote that instance as showing what danger may be run into if this Bill is passed into law- without due and proper consideration. Short of that, and hoping that these points will be considered when we go into Committee, I think that the Bill may be allowed to pass its Second Reading, and I hope it will have the good effect looked for by its promoters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01271"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no intention of interfering with the Second Reading of this Bill, and I rise only for the purpose of affirming what has been said more than once in the course of the discussion&#x2014;that there are a great many things in this Bill that require careful consideration. I have this generally to observe, that there is here an attempt to remove from the jurisdiction of a jury to a question of positive law, the operation of a particular period of time, of which I entirely disapprove. Juries are by no means reluctant to recognise public rights, and I do not
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0304"/>
<col>557</col>
remember a case that I could properly think was wrongly decided against the public, although I know many that were very lightly allowed by the jury to prevail. I entirely differ from the idea that there is any general presumption in a jury's mind against allowing public rights. I am afraid that restrictions of the sort proposed are very likely to produce bad feeling among neighbours, and at all events the tendency of them will be to prevent people doing a good-natured thing in allowing a path over their grounds if it is afterwards to be turned into a question of right. Every one who lives in the country knows that this is a constant subject of quarrel. A great deal of this involves somewhat difficult questions of law, and I think they have been rather lightly dealt with.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me gave the odd illustration of somebody's watch being borrowed and responsibilities being incurred by reason thereof. I will give an example to show that what he pat as an extravagant hypothesis may really have its counterpart in actual fact. I remember the case of a public-house situated where the road divided into two, and for the convenience of his customers the landlord had two side doors, both of which were open. Somebody by accident tumbled and broke his leg when going from one door to the other, and it was seriously sought to assert that because the public could as a matter of fact and very often did go through these two open doors that established a right of way. That is one of the few cases in which I have known a jury to repudiate the claim. But, speaking seriously on the matter, this House should consider carefully what may be the result of establishing a right of way where there is no such thing as a right of way but where there has been indulgence by good nature. By so doing you may destroy the whole value of a building estate. Certainly with reference to Clause 5, if you are going to insist upon a right the party having the right ought to have the responsibilities also, and a person should not be charged with the repair of a road which he is very anxious indeed not to have through his property. That, however, might be the result of the provision in Clause 5. As I have said, I quite recognise that the general feeling is that this matter is one which requires legislation. That, I think, is all that one ought to admit on this occasion. But I think careful consideration is required to see that the rights of owners are not given away
<col>558</col>
lightly. That is a matter we can take care of in Committee, and I offer no opposition to the Motion for the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01272"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the House is generally agreed that this Bill ought to be read a second time, and I am myself strongly in sympathy with any movement to preserve for the public rights of way and to prevent them from being defeated by legal technicalities or legal objections. I wish, however, to offer a few observations in regard to this Bill. The noble Lord who introduced it, following the Memorandum which is prefixed to the Bill, practically rested his case upon the theory that when property is settled nobody is capable of dedicating a right of way to the public. I will not enter upon the legal question that arises upon that. But the Bill deals with many more things than that. The Memorandum states that a Bill in substantially the same form was given a Second Reading in the House of Commons. I do not know whether the Bill was there examined, or whether it was in its present shape then, because any small variation might make a great difference in the result.<lb/>
The drafting of this Bill certainly requires very great attention. The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, pointed out one thing which I had noticed myself, and which, as far as I can see, is a defect in the Bill&#x2014;that if any way has been actually enjoyed by the public without interruption for a full period of twenty years, it shall be deemed to have been dedicated as a public highway unless one or two things happen. No period of time in which the twenty years occur is fixed. It might be that in the reign of Henry VIII a piece of land was used by the public for twenty years. In other words, if you can show that in any period in the history of England there has been twenty years' enjoyment of any way, then the presumption to dedicate is established. I am quite sure that is not the intention of the noble Lord, but it is a point that ought to be taken into consideration.<lb/>
There is only one other thing I would like to say. This Bill is an instance of setting up a law fir England and then adding Scotland by way of a little parenthesis. It is provided in the Bill that in the application of it to Scotland the expression "public highway" shall mean
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0305"/>
<col>559</col>
so and so, and it goes on to the objectionable form of legislation by reference. You are comparing two different systems of law. The system of law in Scotland relating to this matter is different from the system of law in England. I do not wish to take exception in principle to the actual thing proposed in regard to Scotland, but I do say that you might do Scotland the honour of giving her a clause to herself, setting out in language that is applicable to Scottish law what it is you propose. I hope that this will be. turned into a good and useful Bill by a thorough consideration in Committee, prior to which stage I think the noble Lord in charge of the Bill ought to give a little time in order that members of your Lordships' House may take advice as to the meaning of the respective clauses, and prepare Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01273"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall support the Second Reading of this Bill on the ground stated by the noble Lord, that it will put a stop to unnecessary and acrimonious litigation which always occurs on this kind of subject, and on the further ground that it is very important in the present day that country paths and country walks should be as open to the public as possible. If this is to be obtained, it seems to me that you should not only accelerate and assist the establishment of rights of way, whether the right has been dedicated by presumption or otherwise to the public, but that you should also get rid of the very cumbrous and inadequate method of defeating a right of way. No doubt every one has come across cases where when a person is trespassing it is necessary, if you are to strictly maintain your rights, that you should put that person to considerable inconvenience by shutting the gate when he does not expect it, and sending him back a mile and a half on his way. Therefore I think it is necessary that there should be some simpler and more intelligible and better known way of establishing the anti-presumption to dedication than there is at present. I was speaking on one occasion to a promoter of this Bill, and he said, "If you put up a notice over your road to say that people only use the road by your permission and indulgence, that is a clear proof that you do not intend to dedicate." But I am not quite certain that that would be so taken. I think that there ought to be an easier method established by which you can indicate your
<col>560</col>
intention, and that it should be inserted in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01274"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Bill is read a second time I should like to say, with respect to the observations of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack as to the application of the Bill to Scotland, that I do not regard that as at all an important part of the Bill. These clauses were inserted in Grand Committee in the other House. They were no part of the original Bill, and I quite agree that it is not at all a convenient method of legislation; and for my part I should very much prefer that these clauses should be omitted and that the Scottish case should be dealt with in a separate Bill. With regard to the observations of Lord Zouche that the Bill might interfere with town-planning schemes, I would point out that in the Town Planning Act there is power given to close any footpaths. Therefore the Bill would not interfere in any way with that Act. The other objections raised seem to me to be objections for-Committee, and I can only say that when the Bill is in Committee I shall be ready carefully to consider all the objections which have been made, and possibly to modify the Bill. With regard to the main principle&#x2014;namely, dealing with footpaths where the difficulty is great in consequence of settlements in tail&#x2014;there has practically been no objection raised on the part of your Lordships. I think that the debate has been a very satisfactory one in that respect. inasmuch as the main principle of the Bill is now admitted.</membercontribution></p>

and to the fact that these remarkable results are mainly due to the encouragement given to this "infant industry" by remitting one-third of the Excise Duty down to the close of 1909; and to ask His Majesty's Government in what way this encouragement differs from the "bolstering" lately denounced by the President of the Board of Agriculture on behalf of the Government; whether His Majesty's Government will now reconsider their refusal to encourage the production of home-grown sugar on the same lines as they have encouraged Irish tobacco, and, in the event of this refusal being continued, on what principle they base their action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01281">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I do not know that I need make any apology for bringing this subject again before the notice of the House. I was very much struck by the figures which were given about ten days ago in the House of Commons, and which I have put down on the Paper, relating to the progress of the tobacco industry in Ireland, and I call to mind the fact that when I asked for similar encouragement to be given to the infant sugar industry in this country the noble Earl who responded for the Government&#x2014;the President of the Board of Agriculture, who I am sorry is not able to be here to-day&#x2014;informed us that the Government would have absolutely nothing to do with the policy of what he called bolstering or dry-nursing an infant industry. Having regard to that, I think it is only fair to point out; that His Majesty's Government were engaged in this act of bolstering or dry-nursing with very singular success in Ireland up to two years ago, when the encouragement which had been given by this method was replaced by an official grant. Perhaps I shall be told that the Government were only continuing what had been started by the previous Govern-
<col>562</col>
ment. That may be so, but putting aside the fact that I am not aware that one Chancellor of the Exchequer can bind his successor in any way or that there was any real necessity for His Majesty's Government to continue that rebate of Excise Duty, they not only continued it until the five years had expired for which it had been promised by the late Government, but they continued it for another five years and apparently changed their minds later and substituted a definite grant. Therefore when I am told that His Majesty's Government will have nothing whatever to do with encouragement given on these lines, I must say it seems to me nothing short of what I will call official hypocrisy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01282">Then I may be told that these two particular cases have nothing whatever in common, and that the Irish tobacco industry was a purely experimental one whilst the sugar industry is not experimental. If that is the contention put forward by His Majesty's Government, I am afraid they know very little indeed with regard to the technicalities of the beet-sugar industry, because it is in absolutely time experimental stage as regards cultivation on a large scale, and there is a great deal to be learned both by the farmers and by practical men in this country with regard to the best methods of carrying it out. I am afraid, therefore, that there is only one conclusion to be, drawn, and that is that His Majesty's Government were willing to violate their feelings by encouraging Irish tobacco because the demand was backed up by the votes of eighty Irish Members in the other House, and because if they had refused to do so those eighty Irish Members would have made the situation extremely unpleasant. I do feel that we have legitimate grievance against His Majesty's Government in that they should refuse to English agriculture what they have been willing to allow to Irish industry simply because it was backed up by the persistence of the Irish Members.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01283">What I complain of is the official attitude with regard to this, as exemplified more especially by the Board of Agriculture. I am extremely sorry to speak in the absence of the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, and I would have put off this Question again if it had not been that the Notice Paper is rather full, and I thought it would he difficult to bring it on in
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0307"/>
<col>563</col>
the near future. What I complain of is that the noble Earl and those with him seem unable to see beyond the boundaries of their own blotting pads. What we want them to realise is that this is a very big question, and not one to be treated as if it were a matter of putting up a factory for the manufacture of boots or any article such as that. What we want in this country is to let people back to the land, and it is no use talking about bringing people back to the laud unless you have something to bring I hem back to. Small holdings are all right in their way, but that is a mere trifling with the question. What the country is really crying out for is for industries that will give a great deal of rural employment, which will encourage the building of cottages and give employment in country districts, and I submit that there is no industry in the world which does this to the same extent as the sugar industry, as has been proved in all the countries where it has flourished.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01284">There is an idea amongst many people that you must have cheap labour, and that therefore this is not a desirable industry to introduce into rural districts. I believe that to be an entire mistake. You want a considerable amount of labour, but not by any means necessarily cheap. Wages on the Continent are going up, and although in some places labour is cheap, in a great many places where the industry flourishes the labour is by no means cheap. I was in the Magdeburg district the other day, the great centre of the sugar industry in Germany, and I saw the barracks and other arrangements kept there for housing the large numbers of Polish girls who are brought every year for the beet season. Something like 700 of them are imported every year into the Magdeburg district alone, but they are not cheap. I was told that this labour costs the authorities on an average 3s. a day, which I do not think anybody can say is cheap female labour. Therefore I do ask His Majesty's Government to consider this question on the merits of the case, and not to treat it in the very narrow-minded and short-sighted manner which they have hitherto done. We are doing everything we can to bring employment into rural districts. His Majesty's Government give grants to the unemployed. We know perfectly well that the one thing which is wanted is rural labour. Farm colonies have been established which I am afraid often result in mere waste of 'policy, and if only an industry such as this could be firmly
<col>564</col>
established, more would be done in the way of feeding hungry men than by any other scheme now before the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01285">The whole success of the movement depends on the factories, and it is on the factories that the brunt of the difficulties falls. We are not asking His Majesty's Government to aid an industry which cannot stand by itself after it has once got started; it is simply and solely on account of the initial difficulties which must meet the establishment of a new industry such as this. For instance, the successful running of a beet factory depends entirely on being able to get the supplies of beet from within a small circumference round the factory in order to reduce the cost of carriage. Obviously when you first start a factory in connection with an industry with which farmers are entirely unaccustomed you have to cover quite a large area in order to get your supplies of beet. You will not get any one farmer to grow a really large, quantity, and you have to go out a long way over the country to he able to secure the beet supply. The bulk of the expense of carriage to the factory will fall on the factory, and when you are dealing with 50,000 tons of sugar-beet an extra 2s. a ton which the factory would have to pay for carriage amounts to five per cent. on the whole capital of the company and makes a serious difference; whereas after two or three years, when farmers see that it is a paying crop awl when they realise themselves what they are able to do, farmers near the factory will grow larger quantities, and the factories will be able to draw their supplies from nearer areas and the carriage will be correspondingly less.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01286">Those are practical questions which I ask the Government to consider. I do not see that I am asking anything out of the way in urging upon His Majesty's Government to consider whether they cannot do something to help the factories to make a commercial success during the first period of difficulty. I do not care how it is done, but I do not see that there is any practical way of doing it except by the method I suggest. As I said in the previous discussion on February 7 last, it is not practicable to do anything from the Development Fund because by the terms of the Act under which that Fund came into existence it is not allowable to devote money for the purpose as assisting an enterprise trading for profit; and you cannot give grants to the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0308"/>
<col>565</col>
farmers who grow the beet so that they could offer to take lower prices from the factories because there you run up against the Brussels Convention. The grants given by the Board of Agriculture to agricultural colleges for experimental purposes are all very well so far as they go, but they do not affect the question or help the factories. There is only one way in which you can help the factories, and that is by enabling them to sell their finished sugar at a fair profit and by giving them a temporary protection against the established industry that exists on the Continent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01287"><member>THE EARL OR DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, t he noble Earl has referred so pointedly to the little assistance given to the experimental growing of tobacco in Ireland that I should like to say a word or two on that point. I am fully in sympathy with my noble friend in his desire to see something done to start the sugar industry in the United Kingdom, but I am not sure that he is entirely wise in basing his request to the Government on the encouragement that has been given to Irish tobacco. I do not see how the sugar industry could possibly be encouraged on the same lines. The cases are so absolutely and entirely different. I do not think the growing of sugar-beet or the manufacture of sugar has ever been forbidden in Great Britain. It must not be forgotten that the cultivation and manufacture of tobacco was a considerable industry and a profitable one in Ireland, and that it was forbidden by law and put down by force. Therefore I think that in an industry of that kind private individuals have at least some moral claim upon the State to help them to re-establish an industry that had been previously destroyed by the action of the State.<lb/>
I have no doubt, as the. noble Earl says, that there will be a good deal to be done in the way of experimenting in sugar-beet growing, but still I fancy that any practical farmer who can grow manures can grow sugar-beet. But in starting the growth of tobacco in Ireland we were starting the growth of, practically speaking, an entirely new plant, and exhaustive experiments as to the most suitable soil and the most suitable manures, if any, were necessary, and also to determine what varieties of tobacco were most likely to be successfully and profitably grown. Therefore so far as tobacco is concerned the experiments had to be elaborate, lengthy, and exhaustive,
<col>566</col>
and I may say also for those who undertook them exceedingly expensive. It is true that the actual cultivation of tobacco is tolerably easy, but, on the other hand, the harvesting of the crop requires skilled labour; the curing and rehandling of the crop is an exceedingly difficult and technical business, and labour had to be trained in order to undertake that kind of work. I take it that the process of converting the raw material of sugar into the manufactured article is perfectly well understood in Great Britain, as it is on the Continent. The two commodities are in totally different. categories.<lb/>
Sugar, after all, is a food, and tobacco a luxury. I quite admit that it is such a universal luxury that. it may be looked upon as a necessity, but still it is a luxury, whereas sugar is a food, and that is recognised in the enormous difference between the duty on the two articles. The duty on sugar is 10d. per cwt.; the duty on tobacco is 3s. 6d. on the lb. If you look at it <i>ad valorem</i> the duty on ordinary tobacco, the tobacco that ordinary people smoke, is from 1,000 to 1,200 per cent., whereas the duty on sugar is about 3 or 4 per cent. That makes an enormous difference in itself. I do not see how it is possible for any Government, however willing they may he, to encourage the growth of sugar by differentiating between the Excise Duty and the Import Duty, because the Import Duty is already so very low; and I do not think that any Government could stereotype an Import Duty and say that in no circumstances should sugar be admitted absolutely duty free. On the other hand the duty on tobacco is so enormous that it is perfectly easy to discriminate between the Excise Duty and the duty on the imported leaf.<lb/>
And I am bound to point out, in the matter of Irish tobacco, that the Treasury have made a very good thing of it. May I speak for the moment of my own experience? In the three years 1907, 1908, and 1909 the Treasury received from me &#x00A3;6,300 in the way of duty, and I received by way of assistance from them &#x00A3;1,387, so that the Treasury made a net profit out of me of, practically speaking, &#x00A3;5,000&#x2014;not a bad business for the Treasury. At the present moment I have in store 30,000 lbs. of tobacco, which will be worth to me &#x00A3;750 and will be worth to the State &#x00A3;5.500, so that on the whole transaction the Treasury arc getting a good deal out
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0309"/>
<col>567</col>
of it, and I venture to suggest that they are getting rather more than a fair share. My noble friend behind me, Lord Denbigh, perhaps rather over-estimates what has been done for tobacco growing in Ireland. The Department of Agriculture in Ireland have done a great deal. They got expert opinion and all the information that it was possible to acquire, and the Treasury made an allowance for a time, and for a limited quantity of tobacco, of 1s. in the lb. off the duty. After a while&#x2014;I think two years ago&#x2014;instead of ls. in the lb. a definite sum of &#x00A3;5,000 a year was given to be divided amongst those who were experimenting over 100 acres in different parts of Ireland. The Treasury, I am sure inadvertently, got much the better of the growers by that bargain. They calculated that &#x00A3;5,000 a year was equivalent to the rebate, but they unaccountably forgot to take into consideration all the tobacco that was in bond at the time. The result is that the &#x00A3;5,000 a Year is not nearly the equivalent of the 1s. in the lb. rebate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01288"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: The amount of the grant was &#x00A3;6,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01289"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: I thought it was &#x00A3;5,000, but it is immaterial to my argument. As far as I am personally concerned, I know by experience that the change from the rebate to the fixed sum reduced the grant that I received for the seven acres I am allowed to cultivate by exactly 50 per cent. Speaking again of my own personal experience, I get this allowance for seven acres only. Seven acres is quite sufficient to make a small experiment, but it is absolutely insufficient to demonstrate with any kind of certainty whether tobacco can be grown and cured and made a commercial success of. As a matter of fact. I have been growing for the last three years from twenty-five to thirty acres of tobacco, and if you spread the little assistance I have received over the whole of those acres it conies to something very small indeed&#x2014;something less than 3d. on the lb. These experiments have been tried in Ireland now for some few years. I would like to impress upon His Majesty's Government that the experimental stage in no way can be said to be completed. We have demonstrated two facts&#x2014;that you can produce a good article saleable at a fair price, whether of American tobacco or of Turkish tobacco;
<col>568</col>
and that the crop is of immense value as employing labour.<lb/>
As to the employment of labour, I would like to show how that has worked out with me. In 1909 I grew thirty acres of tobacco. Those thirty acres employed in planting and growing 59 men and boys and 4 girls&#x2014;a total of 63; in harvesting there were employed 85 men and boys and 69 girls&#x2014;total 154; and in grading and packing 35 men and boys and 29 girls&#x2014;a total of 64. Your Lordships will see at once that an industry of that kind would be an enormous advantage in a purely agricultural district. The tobacco is sown at this time of the year. It is planted out in May, it is harvested after the hay is all got in, and the grading and packing goes on up till Christmas or even later. I would emphasise the great value of the industry, especially in the employment of girls who would otherwise get no employment at all. An agricultural labourer with two girls who can get work in this business practically doubles or trebles his income. As I have said, the experimental stage is by no means completed. It takes a long time to push a new article like Irish tobacco on the market. We cannot tell yet how far it can be profitably grown. In the first year or two expenses were very high. Naturally the expenses of cultivation and of curing tend to diminish in proportion as your hands get skilled, and in proportion also as you extend the area; and it is obvious that the proportion of labour diminishes rapidly as the area of cultivation is extended.<lb/>
At present we get 2d. on the lb. Excise allowance, and I would like to impress on His Majesty's Government that that 2d. does not anything like make up for the great expense to which growers and rehandlers are put in conforming to the Excise regulations. There is a whole volume of very onerous Excise regulations to be complied with. A grower has to take out a licence, which costs him five guineas; he has to find security of &#x00A3;50 if he wants to grow an acre of tobacco; and he is responsible in the sum of &#x00A3;150 for every acre under tobacco in case the Excise regulations are not complied with. He has to keep most elaborate accounts and send in most elaborate returns. I am not complaining of the Excise regulations. I am sure they are necessary and right,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0310"/>
<col>569</col>
and I would like to say from my own knowledge that the Inland Revenue officers do all they possibly can, consistent with their instructions, to avoid being inconvenient. But I do want His Majesty's Government to understand that complying with these Excise regulations is exceedingly onerous and expensive. I hope His Majesty's Government will look into that matter, because to the growers and the whole industry it is of absolute importance. I shall be glad, and Irish growers generally will be glad, to give the Department every assistance in investigating that case, and I am certain that it would then be realised that the present allowance of 2d. in the lb. is absolutely insufficient, and that a much more substantial sum should be given in order to recoup the growers and rehandlers the great expense they are put to in carrying out the Excise regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01290"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like the noble Earl opposite I am extremely sorry that my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture is not in his place, to reply to the Question on the Paper, but I will endeavour to do so to the best of my ability. From the earlier remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, I felt considerable encouragement, but in view of the latter part of his speech I am afraid I must treat him as hostile as he came down to the same point as Lord Denbigh and asked for money.<lb/>
I will first touch on the history of the matter. The growing of tobacco in Ireland was prohibited by Statute in 1660. In 1779 an Act was passed by the British Parliament allowing tobacco to be grown once more in Ireland. Prohibition was again enforced by an Act in the year 1831, by which time the industry had grown considerably and was being carried On at a very fair profit. The noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, stated that a great deal of skilled labour was involved in the carrying on of this industry, and I took considerable pains this morning to find out why there were no records of any kind of the method in which tobacco was grown between the years 1779 and 1831. Apparently no records were kept at all, but I am assured that the conditions were entirely different both as regards wages and the power to get labour. From the time when the growing of tobacco in Ireland was last prohibited in the year 1831 the question was not raised again until 1903, when Mr. Ritchie gave it his consideration, and, as
<col>570</col>
the noble Earl knows, a considerable rebate was allowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01291"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: Only on small quantities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01292"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: That is so. The concession allowed by Mr. Ritchie in the first instance was limited to selected growers on a limited area of about 100 acres. The principal growers are Colonel Everard and the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven. That went on till the year 1907, when Mr. Redmond's Bill was passed into law permitting tobacco to be grown again in Ireland. without restriction for commercial purposes. The Government then decided that the whole position of the industry was changed; they reconsidered the position, and in lieu of continuing the rebate, which had been granted for experiments only and which could not properly be granted in respect of tobacco grown for commercial purposes, they provided a lump sum of &#x00A3;6,000 a year. I should have stated that before the rebate was done away with the Department of Agriculture asked for an extension of time in which to carry out their experiments&#x2014;I believe that was in the year 1906&#x2014;and the Government allowed the experimental time to be continued until 1913. Therefore when in 1907 Mr. Redmond's Bill altered the whole position of the industry the Government agreed to provide a lump sum of &#x00A3;6,000 a year for each year until 1913, to be spent by the Board of Agriculture at their discretion on experiments in tobacco growing. The object of the change was to avoid the directly protective system of a definite rebate for each lb. produced, and it was hoped that the Department would spend some of the &#x00A3;6,000 in other ways&#x2014;on grants in aid of buildings or plant and technical instruction. The experiment will expire with the disposal of the crop grown in 1913, and the Department of Agriculture, now charged with the duty of superintending it, will then be able to report finally to the Government on the commercial possibilities of the crop from the point of view of Irish agriculture.<lb/>
I turn now to the figures which the noble Earl quotes as showing the "remarkable results" of the encouragement given to Irish tobacco, and which are by themselves misleading. The figures were supplied to Mr. Redmond by Mr. Hobhouse in the House of Commons on March 7 with the warning that in comparing them it should
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0311"/>
<col>571</col>
be borne in mind that on all tobacco grown in Ireland up to the end of 1909 a rebate of one-third the duty was allowed, while since that date the duty has been charged in full and a fixed grant of &#x00A3;6,000 a year has been paid to the Board of Agriculture instead; also that on April 30, 1909, the duties on Irish and other home-grown tobacco were increased. Mr. Hobhouse pointed out that the figures for 1909, therefore, are swollen by the increased duty, and that the figures for 1910 are still further swollen by the absence of rebate. Though the industry may be progressing most favourably, the figures given hardly meet the actual facts of the case.<lb/>
The position taken by His Majesty's Government. in the matter has been clear and consistent from the start. On coming into office in 1905 they found that a certain rebate had been given to this industry in Ireland, and they decided to continue it. Had they not continued it there would have been a great deal of expense incurred by those who had actually started the industry in Ireland, and the Government were unwilling to put them to that unnecessary expense if it could possibly be avoided, always on the understanding that it was simply an experiment and not run for profit.<lb/>
<col>572</col>
I pass now to the final point&#x2014;the analogy between the case of Irish tobacco and the cultivation of sugar-beet. The noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, will recollect that in the debate in this House on July 17, 1906, he admitted that he regarded it as proved that. sugar-beet could be grown at a profit in this country, and he acknowledged then that the industry was not entirely in its infancy. In answer to Lord Crewe, the noble Earl pointed out that the growing of sugar-beet was one thing and the manufacture of sugar was another, and he wanted to have the possibility of manufacturing proved. In reply to that Lord Crewe said that the two things were not on an equal basis, because while it was more or less acknowledged that sugar-beet could be grown it was not acknowledged that tobacco could be grown. The whole point is this. The cultivation of Irish tobacco is an experiment altogther, and much as we should like to encourage all industries it is practically impossible to encourage industries which are not experimental. I am afraid that my answer will not be regarded by the noble Earl as at all satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PERSIA AND TURKEY IN ASIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01299"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> rose to call attention to the state of affairs in Persia, the Persian Gulf, and Turkey in Asia, in relation more particularly to the construction of railways and to international agreements; to inquire as to the policy of His Majesty's Government; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01300">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am sure that your Lordships will greatly regret, on this occasion as much as on any other, the absence of Lord Lansdowne from this Bench, because he happens to be more conversant with one of the subjects, at any rate, to which it will be my duty to call your Lordships' attention&#x2014;namely, the Baghdad Railway&#x2014;than any other member of this House. The object of my Motion is to elicit information from His Majesty's Government on subjects which I think I shall have no difficulty in showing are of great importance to this country. I hope the noble Viscount who
<col>574</col>
is to follow me will pardon me if my remarks to some extent take the form of questions. Those questions will certainly not be asked in any spirit of idle curiosity, but from an honest and legitimate desire to obtain information which is not available to us from other sources, except the Press, the information contained in which, although surprisingly wide, is of course, from the necessities of the case, not invariably accurate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01301">I am not sure that your Lordships' House has not been rather too sparing in recent years in initiating debates on matters of high politics, more especially in relation to foreign affairs. I do not think we have had a single debate on any aspect of what I may call the Central Asian question since the debate on the Anglo Russian Agreement in the beginning of 1908. Any reluctance that may have been felt on our part to initiate discussion has sprung in part from an honourable desire not to embarrass or to challenge the conduct of affairs by His Majesty's Ministers, and it has also been partly due to the fact that since the unfortunate retirement of Lord Fitzmaurice, who very ably represented the Foreign Office, we have never had a direct representative of the Foreign Office in this House of Parliament. I venture with all respect to say that this is a great inconvenience to your Lordships' House, and that on Constitutional grounds it represents a most undesirable innovation. I believe that within the memory of the oldest of us, and much beyond that, there has never been an occasion on which the Foreign Office has not had a spokesman in this House. No doubt that has been largely due to the fact that the Foreign Secretary has usually been a Peer; but the accident that the present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is in the House of Commons&#x2014;and we do not grudge his presence there&#x2014;surely ought not to be made a reason for penalising your Lordships' House or for disabling us in any form from that inner knowledge of foreign affairs which can only accrue from the presence of a direct representative of the Foreign Office. I hope that nothing I am saying will be held to involve the smallest disparagement of the services of noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite. We have all of us admired the ability and grasp with which the Leader of this House, Lord Crewe, has on many occasions spoken for Departments not his own&#x2014;spoken for
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0313"/>
<col>575</col>
them with an authority and lucidity that could scarcely have been equalled by a representative of the Department itself; and certainly to-night I am the last to complain, because the spokesman for the Government is to be the noble Viscount opposite, who has a peculiar right from his long tenure of office in connection with India to speak on every one of the subjects I am about to raise. But, after all, no man can speak adequately for an Office without the inner knowledge that is acquired inside it. I submit that as a matter of Constitutional practice your Lordships are entitled as a still equal and co-ordinate branch of the Legislature, whatever may happen in the future, to first-hand information on foreign affairs; and I very much regret that among the Peers whom the Prime Minister sends up to this House and who adorn the Benches opposite there is not to be found an accredited representative of the Foreign Office who can speak to us with the intimate knowledge that presence in the Office alone can give. I do not desire to labour the point, and I hope the noble Viscount will pardon the digression I have made, and which has no reference whatever to himself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01302">The Notice which I have placed on the Paper is confined to that part of Asia which is commonly called the Middle East, and it raises questions connected with three portions of those territories&#x2014;Persia the Persian Gulf and Turkey in Asia. In all these regions important events have occurred during the past few years, events which, I think, though apparently separate, are closely connected in their operation and their consequences. In sonic of these events India has been primarily and directly concerned, in others indirectly, but in the majority of cases they have had relation to the sphere of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01303">The first subject to which I venture to allude is the condition of Persia. Persia has been passing through troublous times; she has deposed a Sovereign, and given birth to a Constitution; she has been confronted with financial embarrassments, with internal disorder, and with conditions that have almost threatened disruption of the social and political fabric of the country. These symptoms have naturally been viewed with concern and am sure with sympathetic concern in this country, but in Southern Persia and in South-Eastern Persia; where the interests
<col>576</col>
of our trade are so important and where so much British and Indian capital is sunk, it is not unnatural that that concern should have assumed a more active and more vivid form. The condition of affairs in the southern part of Persia, between Ispahan and the sea, and, indeed, in the whole <i>Hinterland</i> of the Gulf ports in the latter part of 1910 was one scarcely distinguishable from anarchy. The local governments almost ceased to exercise their functions, Governors were besieged in their houses; at one port, Lingah, the town was saved from being sacked only by an appeal being addressed to a British naval force to land on the shore, caravans were attacked, the mails were looted, telegraph wires were cut, trade was paralysed, and bands of lawless tribesmen wandered about the interior doing pretty much what they liked. That in a few words is a fair description of the state of affairs about six months or a year ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01304">It was in these circumstances that in October last year His Majesty's Government sent a Note to the Persian Government indicating to them that unless within the space of three months security could be re-established on the trade routes the British Government would be called upon to raise a force of Militia in Persia itself which would be commanded by officers from India, where it is easy to find men who have great experience in that sort of work. At the time this was described in some quarters as a harsh and high-handed proceeding on the part of His Majesty's Government. They were accused of sinister designs on the integrity of Persia and the independence of the Persian Government. I am convinced that such designs were never for a moment entertained. I am confident that the integrity and independence of Persia, which were guaranteed by His Majesty's Government in the Preamble to the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, have no stauncher friends than His Majesty's present Government. I therefore desire to dissociate myself from those attacks. I believe that as friends of Persia His Majesty's Government were anxious only to give a warning to the Persian Government that a continuance of the existing state of affairs was really injurious to the interests of both, and to provide a stimulus to the Persian Government to do for themselves what might otherwise have to be done for them. At the end of three months the condition of affairs was reported to be
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0314"/>
<col>577</col>
better and the improvement was held to be sufficient to justify an extension of the probationary period which had been named. I am sure we were all very glad to be acquainted with this news, and the first question that I desire to put to the noble Viscount is this: What is the present state of affairs in Southern Persia; have the trade routes been reopened; has security been re-established; has the Central Government been enabled to vindicate law and order; and is there hope that friendly relations between Persia and His Majesty's Government will continue, and that the alternative threatened will no t have to be carried into execution?</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01305">I should like to say for myself, and I am sure that what I say will be echoed on both sides of the House, that we are warmly interested in the success of the new Persian regime. There has just entered into office in Persia in the supremely responsible post of Regent in that country a Statesman who is a personal friend of my own. He was an under-graduate with me at the same college at Oxford, and I know him not merely to possess the highest abilities but to be actuated by the most sincere and lofty patriotism in the interests of his country. I speak of the Nasr-ul-Mulk. He appears to have entered upon his functions there with great courage and under the happiest auspices. I hope he will receive at the hands of His Majesty's Government every support they can properly and legitimately give him, not merely on the personal grounds which I have mentioned, but because we all of us desire that the Constitutional experiment which is being made in Persia&#x2014;and Constitutions are not born without a painful travail&#x2014;should be successful, that the Persian kingdom should retain the independence which it has enjoyed for so many centuries, and that not merely our own subjects, in whom, of course, we are chiefly concerned, but the subjects of the Shah himself should enjoy the blessings of peace and order.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01306">The next subject to which I invite your attention is that of the Persian Gulf, and. here I am dealing with what is primarily an Indian subject, because I propose to refer to the arms traffic which has in recent years sprung up with such dangerous scope and with such deplorable results in that region. The Gulf is, of course, the base of operations, but the range of influence of
<col>578</col>
this iniquitous traffic extends right away to the mountain border of India. Your Lordships are probably aware of the great and serious peril that is growing up on that frontier owing to the armament of the tribesmen. W here in the old days when first I went to India they were armed with primitive muskets of their own manufacture or with a small number of superior weapons which they had stolen from our troops across the frontier, they are now equipped with first-class weapons, magazine rifles, for the most part of French or Belgian manufacture, which they obtain by overland communication from the Persian Gulf. I believe that no fewer than 150,000 of these rifles are in the possession of the tribesmen on the British side of the frontier in India. How many are on the Afghan side I would shrink from saying. But I have been told that in 1910 alone as many as 20,000 of the latest magazine rifles and one million rounds of ammunition made their way from the Gulf to the regions to which I have referred. These rifles come from Europe, and the <i>entrep&#x00D4;t</i> of distribution is the port of Muscat, which is the capital of the protected State of Oman. Under the shelter of Treaties, to which I shall presently refer, swift dhows embark cargoes of these arms in or outside the waters of Muscat. They run before the wind to the opposite coast of the Gulf, and there they land them upon the coast, where bands of confederates are lurking in convenient places to receive them. The caravans disappear into the interior, and the next thing that we hear is that a British soldier or an Indian soldier several hundred miles away has been killed by a bullet from one of these rifles on the frontier of India. It is only recently that this trade has attained to really alarming dimensions, and I cannot help thinking&#x2014;though in this I am open to correction&#x2014;that His Majesty's Government must have been rather supine in the earlier stages of the traffic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01307">More lately, however, and especially during the time the noble Viscount was at the India Office, there has been a great awakening, and I have no words of praise too warm for the systematic and vigorous attempts that have been made by the East India Squadron during the past year to curtail this nefarious traffic. It was in the course of these proceedings that in December last there occurred an incident which resulted, I am sorry to say, in the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0315"/>
<col>579</col>
death of five English marines and sailors and eight wounded. This took place at a small spot named Debai, on that part of the southern shore of the Persian Gulf which is commonly known as the Pirate Coast, a name that bespeaks the occupation of the people before the <i>pax Britannica</i> came on the scene. When I was in India I was called upon to conclude Treaties with all the chiefs on this cast to prevent the import of these arms, and the Sheikh of Debai, where this incident happened, was one of the chiefs who signed those Treaties. I believe what happened was this, that owing to the great difficulty of exporting arms from Muscat the trade was shifted to Debai. Our naval officers hearing that a consignment of arms had been landed there went ashore in order to capture them, and it was then that this unfortunate collision took place. I have heard that an ultimatum was presented to the chief, with which lie complied. But the questions which I should like to put to the noble Viscount are these:(1) Was the Sheikh himself implicated in the business? (2) What was the end of the whole transaction? and (3) Is there any reason to suppose that the Treaties to which I have alluded have been broken anywhere else on that coast? It would he a deplorable thing if there were any breakdown in those arrangements of maritime police which have been successfully enforced by the British Government in these waters for the last fifty years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01308">There is another pertinent question I should like to ask the noble Viscount. Is he quite satisfied that the ships of the East Indian Squadron are entirely suited for the purposes of the patrol which they have to carry on? My own impression is that we want a special character of vessel, of very swift speed and of very small draught, in order to pursue these dhows running before the wind and to catch them as they shoot into the shallows and creeks of the opposite coast. The ships of the East Indian Squadron that I saw were not, in my opinion, suitable for that task, and I believe any special expenditure that was incurred upon that object would be more than repaid in the great saving of life and in the political results that would ensue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01309">But before I pass from this subject there is another and bigger question behind&#x2014;to what is the enormous expan-
<col>580</col>
sion of this illicit traffic due? Every State around the Persian Gulf with the exception of Oman has joined in the prohibition of the arms-trade. The State of Oman alone stands aloof. The Sultan of that State&#x2014;I know it, because he told me so himself&#x2014;is willing and anxious to join in the prohibition. But he is precluded from doing so by Treaties, concluded fifty years ago under entirely different circumstances, between himself and France, the United States, and Holland. We may eliminate from our consideration the two latter, because they have nothing now to do with this ease. In the case of France, however, there are French subjects and traders representing considerable commercial interests engaged in this traffic at Muscat, and because of that fact this disastrous state of affairs with the consequences that I have described is permitted to continue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01310">While I was in India the Government at home did their best to induce the French Government to forego its privileges in this respect. Since then I believe that His Majesty's Government have clone the same, and that there have been more than one international conference upon the matter. I do not know what precise form the negotiations have taken, but I believe they have failed in their result, and I have read that if they received territorial compensation elsewhere the French would be prepared to give way. I should be inclined, if I had any right to do so, to make an appeal to the French Government and to the French nation. I might appeal to them as a nation united by ties of the closest amity to ourselves, an amity to which in recent years we have given convincing proofs of the most loyal attachment. But I think I would prefer to appeal to them, if the appeal is not impertinent, as a nation pre-eminently distinguished for a fine sense of chivalry, humanity, and justice, and as a nation which has exercised a great and permanent moral influence upon mankind, to aid us in putting an end to this traffic. If the French Treaties at Muscat of which I speak were abrogated and the port of Muscat were closed to this traffic, the entire arms trade in the Gulf would collapse to-morrow and the whole of this traffic, so pernicious in its character, so hard in the privations that it imposes upon our sailors, so dangerous in its effects upon the tribesmen hundreds of miles away upon
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0316"/>
<col>581</col>
our Indian frontier, would perish at its source. My Lords, is not this a strong case? May we not unreasonably ask the French Government to consider this matter from the wider rather than from the narrower standpoint, and to beg them to defer to those lofty sentiments which have so often inspired their action in public affairs? I say no more upon that point, and I hope that the few remarks I have made will not be distasteful to the members of His Majesty's Government or to the noble Viscount who is to follow me.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01311">Now I pass from these subjects to one which is, perhaps, more likely to interest the great majority of your Lordships' House. I refer to the questions connected with the upper end of the Persian Gulf, about which the noble Viscount has been kind enough to lay upon the Table of the House these abundant and illuminating maps, and more especially I refer, of course, to the Baghdad Railway. I need not ask your Lordships to accompany me into the old days of the history of the Baghdad Railway. We all know that seventy years ago or more this was a project that excited great interest in this country, that it was first projected by English authorities and engineers, and that as lately as 1872, I think, a Committee of the House of Commons, presided over by Sir Stafford Northcote, reported in favour of the construction of such a line. In those days it was regarded as a means of communication with and as a protection for, India. But since then circumstances have changed, and the entire political perspective is now different. It. was about twenty years ago that Germany entered upon that policy of railway construction in Asia Minor which has gradually resulted in every railway in those portions of the Turkish Empire, except the Smyrna Aidin Railway which still remains a British concern, passing into German hands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01312">The present situation dates from a more recent period, from the year 1903, when a Convention was concluded at Constantinople between the Turkish Government and the Anatolian Railway Company for an extension of the line from Konieh, in the heart of Asia Minor, to Baghdad and Basra and to a port then unnamed on the Persian Gulf. At that time the Unionist Party was inn office and Lord Lansdowne was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. No Papers on the
<col>582</col>
subject were laid before Parliament; but you will find in the statements that were made by Mr. Balfour in the House of Commons on April 23, 1903, and the still more famous statement made by Lord Lansdowne in this House on May 5, 1903, a full account of the considerations which actuated the policy of His Majesty's Government at that time. It is quite clear that they took up no hostile attitude towards the railway. Their financial cooperation was desired by the promoters, and they entered into communication with the heads of important financial houses on the subject. It appears from what passed that His Majesty's Government did not object in principle to the construction of the line; that they were willing to agree to an increase in the Turkish Customs Tariff which was necessary in order to raise the loans required for the construction of the line; and that they were prepared to consider the question of sending the Indian mails by that route, and also the question of a terminus on the Persian Gulf at Koweit. They decided, however, that if they were to support the line, the whole of it must be under international control, that an equal share must be given to all the Great Powers taking part in respect of capital, materials of construction, and of management when constructed. It was only when, those conditions were not satisfied that His Majesty's Government receded, with much regret I believe, from the negotiations into which they had entered. It will be remembered that their attitude was affected to a great extent by the expressions of public opinion in the Press and elsewhere at that time. As soon as the text of the Convention was published in <i>The Times</i>&#x2014;it was never laid as a Parliamentary Paper&#x2014;considerable agitation arose in this country, and for my own part, viewing certain conditions of the Convention into which I will not enter in detail but which related to the construction of ports at different points upon the river and in the Gulf, to the navigation of the rivers, and the control of the line, it was not surprising that in consequence of those conditions a good deal of public feeling was aroused. However that may be, His Majesty's Government decided not to pursue the negotiations. Whether that was a fortunate or unfortunate decision on their part it is not necessary now to discuss. The only pertinent fact, I think, is that in the circumstances it was inevitable, and it was ratified, as far as I know,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0317"/>
<col>583</col>
not only by public opinion, but by all on both sides in politics in this country who were competent to decide. I am not aware that any criticism was directed against the then Government by either side. However, that is a matter of bygone history, and I may pass on to more recent events.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01313">Now, my Lords, what is the present position? As regards railway construction the progress during the past few years has not been great. The line has been carried to a point which you will see on either of these maps called Bulgurlu, a little beyond Eregli in the southern part of Asia Minor, and there it has halted for the past six years; but quite recently an Iradeh has been issued for the extension of the line, and money, I believe, has been found for that work. Any one who has been in that part of the world knows that the construction of the most difficult part of the railway now lies before the promoters. They have the Taurus Range to cross, and other great difficulties to overcome. This is the moment when talk is heard of reviving negotiations. During the last day or two I have read in the newspapers of a fresh transaction which is alleged to have taken place in Constantinople, under which the Baghdad Railway, formerly known as the Anatolian Railway, is alleged to have surrendered its concession for the Gulf section, under certain conditions, in return for the grant of a line from Osmanieh, a place on the map a little south of the Taurus Range&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01314"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: It is not marked on the map, I am afraid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01315"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member><membercontribution>: In return for the grant of a line from Osmanieh to the important and well-known port of Alexandretta. I do not know whether the information is authentic or the agreement concluded. If it is, all I can say is that it will be of very great advantage to the German company. They will gain access to an important port on the Mediterranean, and as far as I can see the whole of the trade of Mesopotamia which has a westward trend must find its outlet in that port. I do not think I need enter into that question except to ask the noble Viscount if he has any information to give us on the point. What more immediately concerns us is that, if the statements made are correct, the price alleged to be paid
<col>584</col>
for this very notable concession is the surrender of the rights of the company at the Gulf end of the former line. If that is so, the position is very much easier, should it be the desire of His Majesty's Government to enter into a discussion with the Turkish Government or with any one else in regard to that branch of the subject.<lb/>
The question which any one would naturally ask is&#x2014;What are British interests in the Baghdad Railway? If we have no substantial interests in the matter, why should we bother ourselves about these transactions in a distant part of the world? The answer is that the interests of the British Government are twofold. In the first place, we have commercial and economic interests in every section of that railway from sea to sea&#x2014;from the Mediterranean to the Gulf; and, secondly, political, strategic, and Imperial interests in those sections which are in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. As to the first, over almost the whole of the area covered by the. Baghdad Railway British trade is predominant. We have to see, therefore, that British trade should not be subject to any differential treatment in the future. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said in the House of Commons the other day that the original Convention contains satisfactory assurances on that point. I am not quite clear as to that. A mere clause in the statutes of the company prohibiting differential rates may be of very little use in itself. It would be comparatively easy to frame a tariff favouring categories of goods which come mainly from Germany, as opposed to goods coming mainly from Great Britain and India. This has been done before in a case known to many of your Lordships, and I believe there are clauses in the <i>cahier des charges</i> of the railway which would permit of preference being given to the goods of one country over goods of another. Therefore I am a little suspicious on the matter, and I mention it in order to say that I hope His Majesty's Government will be alive to this aspect of the case. The money which is required can only be procured by their consent, and I hope that consent will not be given unless they are assured that our commercial interests will be protected over the whole of this area from the hostile and differential treatment which I have described as not impossible.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0318"/>
<col>585</col>
There is one branch of the projected railway about which I am not altogether happy&#x2014;the branch -which is to be made from Sadijelt, just north of Baghdad, to Khanikin on the Persian frontier. I know that this concession was part of the original Convention, and that it has always been contemplated that when the railway reached the Persian frontier it should be connected with a line running into Persia itself. That is a matter with which we have a close concern. British goods coming up the Gulf in ships are sent up to Baghdad in boats, and then put on the backs of mules and ponies and carried over the mountains into Persia. This is a British trade amounting to &#x00A3;1,000,000 a year, while the whole trade of the other nations of Europe is not much more than one-tenth of that sum.<lb/>
What is to happen to that trade in future? I think that up to Busra and up to Baghdad by the river routes it will hold its own. As to what will happen on the middle section between Baghdad and Khanikin I ant not quite certain. But I have a shrewd suspicion that when the Russian railway is complete from Teheran to the frontier, the whole of the trade of northern and central Persia, in so far as it goes down by the customary caravan routes to the southern ports, will be diverted to the new line. If that be so, the prospect for British trade is one which we cannot help regarding with some alarm. I hope His Majesty's Government will keep an open eye on this branch of the question, and will lose no opportunity of securing that fair treatment which the enormous preponderance of our commerce on that route entitles us to demand.<lb/>
In the debate in the House of Commons on this subject about ten days ago Sir Edward Grey said that if we want to combat this route with advantage British trade ought to make other routes, though he did not specify what they should be, and lie rather blamed Mr. Balfour for not suggesting any alternative. With all respect, I would say it is not for the Opposition to make suggestions. The responsibility lies with His Majesty's Government; they are the custodians of our interests; they alone are thoroughly acquainted with the facts; and it is for them to put pressure on at the point where it is most likely to be successful. I do not want to press the noble Viscount to make any disclosures that might be
<col>586</col>
inconvenient, but I should like to ask whether Sir Edward Grey's statement was merely a platonic enunciation of a general principle or whether it did point to any definite plan that is in the mind of His Majesty's Government?<lb/>
Your Lordships know well that some years ago there was given to His Majesty's Government an autograph promise from the then Shah of Persia&#x2014;Nasr-ud-din Shah&#x2014;that any Russian railway concession in the north of Persia would be balanced by a corresponding British railway concession in the south. That promise has been quoted more than once by Lord Lansdowne in this House, and it has been repeated by successive Persian Governments. It seems to me, therefore, that if a Russian railroad is to be constructed in the north leading down to Khanikin, the time is drawing near for the possible fulfilment of this pledge in the south, and I should like to know that; His Majesty's Government are not losing sight of this question and that when the hour arrives they will not hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity thus created for them; I do not ask for more specific information unless the noble Viscount is disposed to give it.<lb/>
My Lords, I said just now that our interests in the eastern end of the Baghdad Railway are political and strategic, and the proposition which I would submit is that these considerations start into being the moment we leave Baghdad. It would be a mistake to suppose that our political interests are confined to the Gulf. They are not confined to the Gulf; they are not confined to the region between the Gulf and Busra; they are not confined to the region between Busra and Baghdad; they extend over the whole region right away up to Baghdad. The navigation of the Tigris up to Baghdad has been for scores of years in the hands of a British company, cruelly handicapped, I fear, in recent years, but still holding its own. We have Treaties with the Arab chieftains on the banks of the river not in Turkish territory. Nearly 90 per cent. of the trade that goes up to Baghdad is British and Indian. Large numbers of Indian subjects visit and live at the holy shrines of Kerbela and Nejef, and a constant stream of emigration runs between India and those places. In Baghdad itself we had a Resident 100 years ago&#x2014;eighty years before the representa-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0319"/>
<col>587</col>
tive of any other foreign Power appeared on the scene. There he has been ever since, with a gunboat and an Indian guard. These evidences, which I might multiply, are sufficient to show that we exercise an influence in this portion of the territory at the end of the Gulf that entitles us to consideration and consultation in any question raised in connection with that end of the Baghdad Railway.<lb/>
I am not called upon to discuss the Treaty relations that exist between ourselves and the Sheikh of Koweit. As the Viceroy who negotiated that Treaty I might have something to say on the subject, but I will merely say that with all respect to the claims and pretensions of other Powers our position cannot be ignored, and I am sure that His Majesty's Government, from what the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said the other day, may be relied upon not to surrender the advantages which we enjoy.<lb/>
Our position in the Gulf, however, depends on very much more than on any Treaties we may have concluded with individual chiefs. It rests upon the unassailable ground of our trade in the Gulf; upon our services there for the last 100 years; upon the capital sunk; upon the naval position we keep up; upon the political predominance which we maintain; and, most of all, upon the fact that the Gulf is part of the maritime frontier of India, and that in the politics of the Gulf are involved the security, integrity, and peace of India itself. This is no new discovery, but an admitted truism accepted by all Parties on both side in both Houses of Parliament. It has been explicitly stated over and over again in both Houses. There was the famous statement of Lord Lansdowne, to which I have referred, in this House; there was the earlier statement by the noble Marquess who sits below me, Lord Salisbury; there have been more than one statement by Sir Edward Grey; and I have here a statement made by the late Sir Charles Dilke which I should like to quote as emanating from a man who disagreed with the views of many of those who sit in this House, but who was an almost unique authority on foreign affairs. Speaking in the House of Commons on April 8, 1903, Sir Charles Dilke said&#x2014;
<quote>"He hoped that the Government would most steadily maintain not only our privileged but our monopoly-position in the Persian Gulf.&#x2026;It was vital to our policy. If we should be tempted into introducing any foreign Power to the coast of the Persian Golf so that there they might open up, at
<col>588</col>
the head of the railway, a great naval station, we I should have forced upon us the necessity of making an additional naval expenditure which it would be intolerable to have to face. It was far better to say at once, as we had said, that we would not tolerate the admission of any foreign Power on the Persian Gulf itself."</quote>
I need not labour the point. It is a foundation principle of British policy that we cannot allow the growth of any rival or predominant political interest in the waters of the Gulf, not because it would affect our local prestige alone, but because it would have influences that would extend for many thousands of miles beyond. I venture to think that the assertion of this principle, even in its most emphatic form, is not, and need not be, antagonistic to the interests of any other Power in that part of the world. I imagine that it would be frankly accepted by Germany, and I have no knowledge that it has ever been disputed by her. I believe it to be compatible with a full and generous recognition of the sovereignty of Turkey in these parts. When we come to the upper end of the Gulf and to the district between Fao and Baghdad, to my mind a strong, prosperous, and independent Turkish Government, able to consolidate its power, to keep in check the unruly tribes on the bank, to guarantee the safety of the waterways, and to develop the immense potential resources of the Delta, is an object that ought to be one not merely of anxious solicitude, but of paramount necessity to a British Government. I can imagine nothing that is more essential to ourselves than a strong Turkish Government in these regions, and I am sure that this House would commend any steps taken to fortify the authority of the Turkish Government in that quarter, and that whether we enter into negotiations with Germany, or, as now seems more probable, with Turkey, there is nothing in our present claims or in our present position that is likely to be detrimental to the successful issue of any such negotiations.<lb/>
My Lords, quite frankly, if I were to speak this afternoon as an Englishman alone I do not think that I should be anxious to see the Baghdad Railway carried down to the Gulf. It will contain in itself elements of change, of novelty, and possibly of danger. I am not clear that it would benefit our trade; it might conceivably injure it. I have never convinced myself that it is desirable to continue the building of the railway beyond
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0320"/>
<col>589</col>
Baghdad, and certainly not beyond Busra, up to which 1 believe, even if a railway be there constructed, the trade will still go in boats. I doubt if the line from Busra to the Gulf, whether to Koweit or to whatever other port, will even pay the interest on the capital that is expended on it. These are my individual opinions for what they may be worth, and I know the country pretty well. But if, in spite of these opinions, the Turkish Government is resolved on the building of the railway in so far as it lies within its own territory, and if the railway can be built, without serious financial risk, then I think His Majesty's Government are entirely entitled and are bound to enter into a discussion with them in a reasonable spirit, with a view, it may be, to arriving at some conclusion.<lb/>
Sir Edward Grey said in the House of Commons ten days ago that we possess certain advantages in a discussion with Turkey. He pointed out, that the increase of four per cent. in the Customs duties which the Turkish Government are seeking cannot be conceded without our consent. He pointed out the position of vantage which we enjoy at Koweit and the upper end of the Gulf. I agree with all he said, but if anything he understated rather than overstated our position. My belief is that the whole of the Baghdad Railway, from sea to sea, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf, cannot be built without access to the financial markets of Great Britain and. France, and it is only by international co-operation between the various Great Powers concerned that the requisite security for the investment can be obtained. I doubt if it can be financed by any one Power alone, or if remunerative profits can be secured unless more than one Power is taken into co-operation in the matter. There are also great schemes afloat for the development and irrigation of other parts of the country, of Chaldea and of Mesopotamia. Every one of us would like to see these projects translated into effect, but those of us who have travelled there are inclined to wonder, if these works be executed, where the population is to come from to till the ground thus recovered and to revive the vanished glories of the past. Believe me, my Lords, there is a very long furrow to be hoed before the end is in sight. I do not make these remarks in the slightest degree to deprecate or depreciate the scheme, but I do utter them from some slight
<col>590</col>
knowledge of the facts in order to modify the exaggerated anticipations entertained in many quarters and to indicate more strongly than anything else that without British support it is more than doubtful if any of these schemes will see the light of fruition. It is not for me to attempt to indicate methods of construction or control that might have to be adopted if the Gulf section of the line were built. Many plans are discussed in the newspapers. I confess that the proposal of an international system, with its costly board of management and its constant potentialities of friction, is not one that excites my enthusiasm. His Majesty's Government may have their own views about the matter. I do not presume to dictate to them. My own position is simply this, that whatever method of construction of the Gulf section, if it be built, they may favour, I hope they will see that the predominance of our interests is maintained, and that nothing is done to impair or whittle away or derogate from the rights which I have described.<lb/>
Before I conclude there is one subject about which I shall say little, because I know little, but about which it is impossible to be altogether silent. I allude to the alleged Agreement between Russia and Germany entered upon, if not concluded, at Potsdam in November last. Several versions of this Agreement have appeared in the newspapers. I am quite prepared to believe that they are all in' correct, but we have certain authoritative statements which have been made by the German Chancellor, speaking at Berlin, and by M. Sazonoff. the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking at St. Petersburg; and from those utterances I think we are justified in believing, first, that when the German railway from Baghdad reaches Khanikin, on the frontier of Persia, the Russians are prepared to build a railway from Teheran or its neighbourhood down to the frontier to meet it; and secondly, that the Russians have withdrawn the opposition which at one time was strong on their part to the construction of the Baghdad Railway as a whole&#x2014;both of which, of course, are great advantages to Germany; and, on the other hand, that some recognition has been given by Germany to Russian political, commercial, and strategical predominance in the northern part of Persia, which, of course, would be an equal gain to Russia. It would be idle to deny that this
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0321"/>
<col>591</col>
version of affairs, if it be true, has excited some apprehension, and that there are many who have feared that there might be some breach impending in that <i>entente</i> between Russia and ourselves which was the direct object of the Anglo-Russian Agreement concluded by noble Lords opposite a few years ago, and for which, as many of us think, they paid a very high price in that Agreement, but to which, at any rate, nobody can say that this country has not loyally and unflinchingly adhered.<lb/>
It would be a great relief to us if His Majesty's Government could say, without trenching on forbidden ground, that all that has been done has been done with their full knowledge and sympathy, that our undertaking with Russia has not been in any degree weakened, and that our interests have not suffered and are not likely to suffer. I should be the last to argue that the broad lines of international policy or the grouping of allied Powers are incompatible with friendly arrangements between members of the different groups on subjects that more specially concern themselves. Every such Agreement may be, and ought to be, a link in the international chain of peace, but of course it ought to be subject to the condition that these minor accommodations are carried out with perfect loyalty to the larger issues that are concerned, as I doubt not has been the case in the present instance, and that private interests are never allowed to get the better of public obligations. I do not venture to say more on the point, and I hope that I have not said too much.<lb/>
There is only one other subject to which I desire to allude, and it is this. In the course of the discussion on all these questions there has again emerged, after long oblivion, the idea of a great trans-Persian line, running either from Trebizond, in the corner of the Black Sea, via Tabriz to Teheran, or from the Caspian Sea to Teheran, and then continuing via Yezd and Kerman in a south-easterly direction towards the eastern frontier. Whenever such a scheme is proposed it fills the imagination of everybody who regards it, because it is part of that great scheme of inter-Continental communication which, in the belief of all of us, will some day be realised. The noble Viscount will agree with me that it is not the shortest line. The shortest line is through Afghanistan, where only a gap of a few hundred
<col>592</col>
miles separates the Russian terminus from our own. He will also agree with me that, owing to circumstances, into which I need not enter, such a line is outside the sphere of practical politics, at all events at present. Nor do I need to enter into an examination of the features of the trans-Persian line. Many important issues are involved in that examination. I am aware that experts entertain most widely different opinions on the subject. I mention it only because I have seen it stated that the Russian Government have intimated their willingness to support the scheme if it is carried out without injuring Russian commercial interests and without imposing fresh burdens upon the Russian Treasury. The second of these "ifs" is a very big "if." I have never been able myself to imagine where the funds are going to come from for these great trans-continental schemes in Persia and elsewhere. Obviously, no company will find the money unless it has a guarantee by some Government. There are only three Governments concerned. The first is the Government of Persia, which is unhappily not in a position to give a guarantee to anybody. The second is the Government of Russia, whose attitude I have already described. The third is the Government of this country, and I confess I do not see the Chancellor of the Exchequer coming down to the House of Commons and addressing a request to Parliament to guarantee Government funds for this line. And, then, another condition has to be satisfied before such an idea is entertained, and that is that there is a sound and stable Government in the country through which the line runs. I will not pursue the subject. I have merely mentioned it to ask the noble Viscount whether the idea is at all seriously entertained, and whether we ought to regard it as occupying any place in the field of international politics at the present time.<lb/>
My Motion ends with a request for Papers. Really I ought to thank the noble Viscount for having so far anticipated me as to overwhelm us with these admirable and useful maps, but when I talked about Papers I meant something more than maps. The fact is that the Governments in recent years have been rather parsimonious in their distribution of Papers on Asiatic matters. I believe that as regards Persia the last Blue Book we have is Persia No. 1, 1910, which carries events up to the end of 1909. But about the Persian Gulf, so far

<col>593</col>
as I know, we have had nothing at all&#x2014;nothing about gun-running or the proceedings at Brussels to which I have referred. As regards the Baghdad Railway, we have never had anything. The Convention itself has never been laid before Parliament, and if you want to get it you have to go either to an obsolete copy of <i>The Times</i> or else to the book of some intrepid traveller who has secured it in his journeys and published it as an appendix to his work. When you contrast this dearth of information with the plethora of official Blue Books which used to be showered upon the country in the clays when Russia in Central Asia and Afghanistan were the subjects of popular discussion the contrast is amazing. I really do not know whether it is due to the fact that modern Governments are becoming more indifferent to Parliament, or whether Parliament is becoming more indifferent to its own interests. The fact remains that we have had no Papers on this subject, and I respectfully ask the noble Viscount to present us with all the Papers that he reasonably can. I have wandered over a wide field in the remarks I have had the honour of addressing to your Lordships. I am grateful for the attention you have been kind enough to give to me, and I hope I may receive, as I have no doubt I shall, a satisfactory reply from the noble Viscount on behalf of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01316">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers in relation to the construction of railways and to international agreements in Persia, the Persian Gulf, and Turkey in Asia.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Curzon of Kedleston.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01317"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN) </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will begin by saying how cordially I concur with the noble Lord in regretting the absence of Lord Lansdowne. I regret it on all grounds, but more particularly because Lord Lansdowne is specially conversant with all the particulars of the origin of our dealings in the important matter of the Baghdad Railway. The noble Lord referred very kindly, and not more kindly than justly, to the authority and lucidity with which my noble friend Lord Crewe discusses foreign affairs in this House, and nobody could more deplore his absence to-day than myself.<lb/>
<col>594</col>
The noble Lord has taken us on to as important ground as. I think, any member. of your Lordships' House could undertake. People do not yet recognise how enormous are the issues involved, how enormous is the area involved in the questions which-the noble Lord has raised, and nobody in this House has a better right to lead discussions upon these questions than the noble Lord. He has been most part of his life, I should think, closely interested in the whole group of questions that he has dealt with this afternoon, and his knowledge to within six years ago is first-hand and personal knowledge. I do not for a moment dispute his claim that he has discussed all these questions, large and important as they are, in a perfectly honest and legitimate and sincere spirit. We have no possible ground of complaint. I think he was a little ungrateful in his irony about the maps, because really when he last spoke on these issues in 1908 he said how he regretted that there were no maps, and that without maps the discussion was unintelligible. I therefore thought that in providing maps I was meeting the noble Lord's views.<lb/>
The noble Lord mentioned at the end of his speech what are called the Potsdam negotiations, if that is the right word, between Russia and Germany. Nobody knows better than the noble Lord that for-us at this stage to discuss negotiations between two sovereign independent Powers before those negotiations, so far as we know, have come to a definite conclusion would be to take up a position which no official or responsible person, either in this House or the country, has a right to take. Therefore I have nothing to say about what are called the Potsdam negotiations.<lb/>
With regard to the subject of trans-Persian railways, any ideas or designs on that subject are far too immature for any sensible or useful or instructive observations to be made upon them. I for one personally should feel very much inclined to follow the noble Lord in his doubts, or more than doubts, as to the workableness of those particular designs. I will follow the noble Lord through the three heads to which he asked our attention. The first is, of course, Persia. In all that lie said as to the present Regent in Persia His Majesty's Government. entirely concur. It is upon his character, in truth, that we lean, and upon which we rest our hopes.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0323"/>
<col>595</col>
His recent exhortations in the Mejliss, his account of what ought to be the public duty of that important body, the line he has taken, and his insistence upon their giving his Minister a stable majority&#x2014;all those show a man of character, to whose policy we can look for nothing but satisfactory results. The Minister whom he has chosen shares those moderate and practical views, and we may hope, and we do hope, with such confidence as is possible in a country whose condition has been so confused, that from that there may emerge a sufficiently stable condition of affairs.<lb/>
Then I turn to the question of the southern roads. It is no wonder that the noble Lord called our attention to the condition of those roads, but I believe that if he had been able to follow events as closely as a member of the Government has to do, he would have felt that his picture of the state of things, unsatisfactory as it is, is rather exaggerated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01318"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member><membercontribution>: I limited it to the last six months of 1910, and my information was obtained from official sources.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01319"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I know; but to say that the state of things was little short of anarchy is certainly using a phrase far in excess of the facts. The noble Lord has told your Lordships what happened, and I am very glad that he has, as I would have expected, dissociated himself from those who impute that the action we took in October last year was due to a sinister or nefarious design on the independence or integrity of Persia. Of course, I should have expected the noble Lord to keep clear of innuendos of that sort. Though there was not anarchy, the state of things had become very bad. In November the Russian Consul-General at Bushire was attacked while on his way to his post, and the British Consul was also attacked, and on both occasions lives were lost. In May last a representation was made to the Persian Government, but no steps were taken by them, and so it was that in October the Persian Government were informed that if they failed to restore something like order on these roads His Majesty's Government would be compelled to insist on the organisation of a local force for the purpose, to be commanded by officers from the Indian Army, and the expense to be defrayed by a ten per cent. surcharge
<col>596</col>
on certain ditties. After further exchange of Notes the Persian Government in December detailed the measures which they proposed to take. We most cheerfully and willingly, and with perfect confidence in their good faith, agreed to give them another opportunity of fulfilling the obligations which we had imposed upon them, and, in the noble Lord's own phrase, our admonition to the Persian Government was meant to provide them with a stimulus. The noble Lord asks as to the present situation on the southern roads. It was impossible to say, in view of the social conditions that obtained there, that any immediate restoration to order was possible, but it is the fact that the position there is greatly improved; whether that is due, as some say, to the severity of the weather or other causes we do not know, but we are watching with patience and with hope.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord made reference to Persian railways, and alluded to the Rescript issued by the Shah some years ago. This is a very important document, and when the time comes for practically discussing railway construction in Persia, it will be a very important deliverance. The Shah, in this autograph letter, says&#x2014;
<quote>"Convey these commands to His Excellency the British Minister Plenipotentiary. Even give him this very autograph in order that lie may keep it and be satisfied that our former promise with regard to the priority of the British Government over others in the construction of a southern railway holds good; and certainly, whenever railway concessions in the north, etc., are given to others immediately a concession for a railway from Teheran to Shuster, or such a one, will be given to the English company; and, of course, then the clauses and conditions will also be examined, in order that it be to our advantage and interest for the benefit of commerce of both parties; and positively no southern railway without consultation with the British Government will be granted to any foreign country."</quote>
These explicit assurances were once more confirmed in the year 1900<lb/>
His Majesty's Government cannot conceal from themselves that the question of railway construction in Persia may involve important strategical considerations to which they cannot remain indifferent, but provided that these and obvious commercial considerations can be satisfied by an adequate British participation in any southern railway schemes which may be adopted by the Persian Government, then His Majesty's Government would not construe their preferential rights in any narrow or exclusive spirit.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0324"/>
<col>597</col>
I turn to the Persian Gulf, which the noble Lord knows a great deal about from personal observation. We cannot realise our services in the Gulf too fully, and there is no harm in reciting them again and again. If by any mischance in negotiations our position in the Persian Gulf is challenged, this is the answer. That position has been described as unique by an eloquent author, who proceeds to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Although Great Britain has not sought territorial acquisitions in those regions, she has for generations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere except in the capacity of sovereign; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion; she has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects; has patrolled, during upwards of two centuries, waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship; has kept, in strange ports, au open door through which the traders of every nation might have as free access to distant markets as her own. If Great Britain has become, in any sense, the arbiter and Guardian of the Gulf, it has not been through a restless ambition urging her on to the control of the waste places of the earth, but in obedience to the calls that have been made upon her in the past to enforce peace between warring tribes, to give a free course to trade, to hold back the arm of the marauder and oppressor; to stand between the slave-dealer and his victim."</quote>
That is our charter. It is a true picture of our historical position. Indeed, it is owing to British enterprise and the expenditure of British life and treasure that the Persian Gulf at this moment is open to the navigation of the world, and to tins cause alone it may be said that the seaborne trade of Mesopotamia owes its very existence. Sir Edward Grey has said in the House of Commons, and I hope it is perfectly understood, that we adhere to the position taken up, and expressed, I think, in this House by Lord Lansdowne in 1903. That at all events ought to be satisfactory to the noble Lord.<lb/>
The noble Lord next referred to Muscat. Muscat, as your Lordships know, is at the mouth of the Gulf to the west, and is the centre of the arms traffic, the mischievous effects of which to us in India and to people in the Gulf are well known to your Lordships. The noble Lord, after all, put his finger upon the real <i>crux</i> of the situation, though I am not quite sure that he appreciated how great the difficulty is. I think he is in error when he says that it is the French who are the manufacturers of the arms. The French, I think, distribute them; but the quantity of French arms imported is less than that imported by at least three other nations, including one with which we are particularly well
<col>598</col>
acquainted. The noble Lord made a powerful appeal to France to abandon reliance upon the Treaties with the Sultan of Muscat. He made a passionate appeal to France to look at this thing in the light of those great ideas and splendid moral impulses which have enabled France for generations to play so momentous a part in the civilisation of the Western world.<lb/>
Every word of the noble Lord's appeal will, I am sure, touch the French, but it must be remembered that France has Treaty rights. Can we expect a country to surrender Treaty rights affecting some portion of her own community without getting something in return? My knowledge of international history does not provide me with any case in our immediate times where there has been such a surrender without a <i>quid pro quo</i>. Upon that I will not say more than that we are engaged in pressing upon the attention of the French Government the difficulties which they create for us and for others in the Gulf by maintaining the practices which are permitted under their Treaty rights. I am not sure that, the noble Lord's figures were perfectly accurate. Owing to the despatch of the squadron upon which he commented, the arms traffic of Muscat, which doubled between 1906 and 1908, has fallen in value. Since we set on foot a naval blockade, the value of arms imported into Muscat has fallen from &#x00A3;237,000 in 1908 to &#x00A3;103,000 in 1909, and it will be found to have fallen still further in 1910. The value of the French arms is less than one-tenth of that total. We hope, however, that the French Government will be impressed by the statements which are before them and that good results will follow. As to the question raised by the noble Lord whether the precise type of warship now employed is the right machinery for putting down this traffic, I can express no opinion, but I dare say it is worth considering.<lb/>
One other word with regard to the Gulf. I certainly quarrel with the use of the word supine. The noble Lord is quite mistaken if he thinks we have been supine with regard to the arms traffic. The noble Lord referred to the incident at Debai. I confess that, considering the great size of the other questions raised by him, this was rather diminutive. The facts are these. The Arabs fired on a party who went to search for arms&#x2014;a party from one of His Majesty's ships. A general engagement ensued, in which we had five killed and nine wounded,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0325"/>
<col>599</col>
and the enemy thirty-seven wounded. The Sheikh, though invited to meet the British commander and assist in the search, did not reply, and only appeared after trouble had begun. He then took measures to restore quiet. The British Resident and the Admiral at once proceeded to Debai and interviewed the Sheikh. His attitude being unsatisfactory, a written ultimatum was presented to him, and forty-eight hours were given him in which to comply with certain terms. He accepted those terms on December 30, and on January 23 the Government of India reported that the conditions had been carried out. I do not see what place a trivial incident of that kind has in so large a scheme of presentation of Gulf policy as the noble Lord has given us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01320"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member><membercontribution>: It really had a place. The incident at Debai was trivial in itself, but I was concerned to ask whether this rupture of the Treaties prohibiting the importation of arms was an isolated instance at Debai, or whether there was any reason to think that it extended to other parts of the coast, because if so the matter would be serious.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01321"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I quite agree that in that case it would be serious. I cannot say with absolute certainty that it is an isolated case, but there was nothing at all, or was not when I left the India Office, to lead us to suppose that there was anything like a general return to piratical and marauding ways in that region.<lb/>
I come now to the Baghdad Railway. The noble Lord has presented quite truly and forcibly to the House all the elements which make what is called the question of the Baghdad Railway a question of vital importance. I agree with him in extending the view which he invited the House to take of all the operations covered by the name of the Baghdad Railway to the whole area of which the Baghdad Railway when it is made will no doubt be a central artery. There I entirely agree with the noble Lord; but I do not agree with him in his history of our dealings with this question. And let me say, to begin with, that it is no novelty that German interests should desire to find their way down towards the Gulf and Mesopotamia. I dare say the noble Lord knows that General von Moltke was at Biredjik with Turkish
<col>600</col>
forces in 1839, and was then fascinated with the idea of what could be clone on the banks of the Euphrates. That circumstance and the fact that Moltke wrote as he did has exercised a curious effect on the German imagination ever since. At any rate since 1873 the Germans have taken a practical and an increasing part in the construction of railways in Asiatic Turkey. In 1873 the first section of what is now known as the Anatolian Railway was built by a German engineer, von Plessel, to the order of the Turkish Government, and in 1888 it was transferred to a German company. Subsequently&#x2014;in 1896&#x2014;that line was extended to Konia. Three years later a concession was granted to a German syndicate for the extension of the line to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf, and after undergoing various modifications this concession for the Baghdad Railway assumed its final shape in 1903.<lb/>
The noble Lord rather got on to dangerous ground if he is anxious to avoid anything in the nature of a controversy, as I am sure he is, when he referred to the action taken by His Majesty's Government in 1903, when Lord Lansdowne was Foreign Secretary. I think he forgets that whatever extenuation there may be for, as I think, the misjudgment that was made in 1903 when the British Government refused participation in the Baghdad Railway, at all events that action, however you may explain or extenuate it, has not been justified by events. I well remember the activity of certain organs of public opinion at that date, but I do not believe any of those who inspired, as I think, that rather unhappy decision would say to-day that it would not have been far better as events have proved if we had in 1903 accepted, with certain modifications, what we then had a chance of, participation in the Baghdad Railway. I do not say the noble Lord endeavoured to blame us for the difficulties of the position in which any British Government must now find itself in connection with this project. Even at the date when the Baghdad Railway concession was granted the Germans had already secured a certain position, as they were working about 650 miles of railway in Anatolia before they began to get concessions for this larger and more prolonged operation. The noble Lord said the decision at that date on our part was inevitable. I never could understand that. But let it pass. I would not have men-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0326"/>
<col>601</col>
tioned it but for the fact that the noble Lord endeavoured to vindicate Mr.Balfour's Government from a charge which certainly has not been made here. It was this which made it necessary for me to point out that the decision of that day has not been justified by events.<lb/>
What is the present position? The position as we found it in December, 1905, when we assumed office, was that a concession for the Baghdad Railway to run from Konia to Busra and then to some undetermined point on the Gulf had been granted years before, and that the concession was not merely for the main line but also for many branch lines, of which, perhaps, the most important is the line on which the noble Lord expatiated, from Baghdad to Khanikin on the Turkish frontier. The Germans were in the situation, it is no use denying it, the Germans were in the position of <i>beati possidentes</i>; they held under an international agreement for a number of years. A great deal of nonsense is talked about the possible danger&#x2014;I do not refer to the ulterior possibilities&#x2014;to British interests which may be involved some day or other when this railway is completed, and there have been whimsical apprehensions expressed. One is that it will constitute a standing menace to Egypt, the noble Lord did not say that&#x2014;because the argument is that, by a junction with the Syrian Railway, which is French, with the Hedjaz line, which is Turkish, there would be established uninterrupted communication between the Bosphorus and Western Arabia. That would hardly be an argument to Turkey for abandoning railway construction on her own soil, whereas it overlooks the fact that the Sinai Peninsula intervenes. Another writer has lamented the consequences of the extension of the railway in Mesopotamia, where long-established British commercial interests are so important and still dominant, and a doleful picture was drawn of the fate awaiting the large trade in British and Indian goods, estimated at over a million sterling in value, which finds its way by the Tigris to Baghdad and passes by caravan to Western Persia. The Baghdad Railway may or may not exercise a prejudicial influence on British trade, but the moment to decide that question was the earlier moment before the concession was granted, not after. You cannot get over this plain cardinal fact, that this railway is made on Turkish
<col>602</col>
territory by virtue of an instrument granted by the Turkish Government. You cannot get over that fact, that is what you start from. I see articles in newspapers every day in which it is assumed that we have the right there to do what we please; that is not so; it is not our soil, it is Turkish soil, and the Germans alone are there because the Turkish Government have given them the right to be there. Let us therefore start with a view of the situation from that plain and simple fact.<lb/>
The noble Lord has referred to the <i>cashier des charges</i>, which I propose to lay before Parliament. It is really a schedule, and it is said it might be worked to our disadvantage. Remarks made by Mr. Balfour in another place pointed in this direction. That, again, is attached to the Convention of 1903, and it does not appear <i>prima facie</i> that the Ottoman Government or the railway company contemplate the manipulation of rates against British goods either on the main line or on the branch to Khanikin. Be that as it may, His Majesty's Government realise as fully as any member of the House can desire that British trade interests in these regions are of real and enormous importance. I go so far with the noble Lord. We believe that they cannot be effectually safeguarded by what I may call the plastic stipulations of a <i>cashier des charges</i>. His Majesty's Government cannot legitimately object to the construction of any railways on Turkish territory, but they cannot directly or indirectly facilitate the construction of those railways if their completion is to alter the existing position in Mesopotamia to the detriment of British interests and to the exclusion of British participation on reasonable terms. It is undeniable that His Majesty's Government are in principle favourable to the construction of railways in Turkey; they appreciate how important this construction is, among other purposes, for the consolidation of the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i>, and the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> in Constantinople we cordially wish will continue and prosper. If, therefore, we could look forward to a settlement on terms acceptable to this country of the railway question in Mesopotamia, then not only would we use our influence with the Sheikh of Koweit to permit under certain conditions the construction of a terminus at the excellent harbour he possesses, but the principal objection now entertained to an increase in the Turkish
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0327"/>
<col>603</col>
Customs duties, which are of course the instrument by which we have a hold upon these affairs, would at once fall to the ground.<lb/>
Now I come to the various announcements to which the noble Lord referred. Under the 1903 concession the Baghdad Railway Company had acquired a right to build a line from Konia, to some point on the Persian Gulf to be determined hereafter; and under Article 12 of the 1903 Convention the company acquired certain preferential rights in regard to the construction of branches to the Mediterranean on the coast of Syria. Under arrangements now arrived at in Constantinople we understand that the company have renounced their right to the section of the Baghdad Railway between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf and have renounced their right to construct a port at Bussorah, on condition that they receive a certain share in any new company&#x2014;which presumably, would be a Turkish company&#x2014;formed to carry out the portion of the 1903 concession which they (the Baghdad Railway) have now renounced. On the other hand, in fulfilment of the terms of the 1903 concession the Baghdad company have come to an arrangement whereby, first, a branch line is to be built from Osmanich on the main line to Alexandretta on the gulf of that name, and have provided that certain revenues are allocated to them in accordance with Article 35 of the original concession of 1903 for the continuance of their main line from El Helif to Baghdad.<lb/>
The upshot of this arrangement is that within certain limitations the Turkish Government have regained their liberty of action in regard to the section of the Baghdad Railway between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf. Those proposals which they have made to His Majesty's Government are in a very early stage; but we wish it to be clearly understood that His Majesty's Government sincerely desire a settlement that will remove all anxiety as to the important British trade interests concerned and at the same time dissipate the mists of suspicion and distrust that have so often obscured this question; a settlement in short that will remove all apprehension that the Baghdad Railway and its terminus is likely to create diplomatic friction between any of the parties interested. We feel that any arrangement must be one to which Germany must be a consenting party, as the original concession-holders were
<col>604</col>
Germans. That is the present position as affairs stand at the present moment. As noble Lords will understand we cannot without prejudice to negotiations which will naturally follow these proposals, make any more detailed statement. We feel convinced in regard to present arrangements that there is a marked step in a favourable direction, promising development of these various and complicated issues. In further negotiations His Majesty's Government will be animated by the desire to remove all possible cause for international friction and, your Lordships may be very sure, to uphold all the important interests both present and future of this country.<lb/>
I have detained the House so long that if the noble Lord will excuse me I will not follow him into the minor points he has raised. I for one listened with pleasure to the expression of his own large, well-supported views on the issues of this new chapter opening in the relations between Europe and Asia. Here is no Alexander going from Europe to Asia&#x2014;it is a very different thing you have to think of; here are great rival international interests, and a great movement more difficult to adjust in all its elements. It is not merely military; the military and strategic aspects are among a whole congeries of elements that go towards the complication of questions of enormous importance both to the political and commercial future of this country, and therefore to the world.<lb/>
As to the Motion for Papers. I will undertake to lay before the House further correspondence on Persia, the text of the Baghdad Railway Convention of 1903 and the supplementary Convention of 1908, the <i>cahier des charges</i>, and the loan contracts. The noble Lord asked for the Brussels Convention, and I will see whether it can be given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01322"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no one can deny how vast., delicate, and intricate are the interests involved in the various questions that have been brought before your Lordships' House by Lord Curzon to-day. On February 7 last I put a Question to the noble Viscount relative to the Potsdam interview. He then said that he was unable to give any information, but I should have thought that by this time it might have been possible to throw some light on the negotiations which took place there.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0328"/>
<col>605</col>
In opening this debate Lord Curzon drew a picture of the great disorder that has taken place in the southern portion of Persia. On that I rather agree with the noble Viscount opposite that Lord Curzon over-coloured the picture. It must be remembered that in the five months subsequent to last March the trade of the southern ports increased by eighty-six per cent. as a whole, at Mohammerah and Ahwaz as much as 100 per cent., and that even at Bushire there was a twenty-two per cent. increase during those five months, and that is the part of the country most liable to interruption owing to brigandage and general misgovernment. At the present time when any ordinary robbery takes place it is at once put down to the Government. An instance was related to me of the agent of a firm who had embezzled money. A little plan was concocted, and it was represented that the caravan had been robbed, and this again was laid to the charge of the Government. It may be argued that if the country is so weakly governed that these accusations can be made therefore there ought to be some stronger hand to guide their affairs. But how has it come about that there has been this, great misgovernment and disorder in Persia?<lb/>
The noble Viscount took great credit for the carrying out of the Anglo-Russian Convention, which distinctly stated in the Preamble that the integrity of Persia was to be preserved. But how can you preserve the independence of a country when it has in certain portions been largely garrisoned by foreign troops? Time after time with an empty Exchequer Persia has attempted to get funds for carrying on the administration of the country but has been thwarted in her efforts. The Nationalist Government have not been allowed a free hand to put their affairs on a proper basis. They could not do so without having funds at their command, and these funds have been repeatedly denied them. We now understand that the Russian garrison at Kasvin is to be removed, or possibly only reduced. I understand that about seventy men are still being kept there. I would like to know whether the other garrisons are being removed. Again, the Persian Government in their struggling condition have had their Minister of Finance assassinated, and his murderers were given protection by the Russian Consulate or the Russian Legation and were removed
<col>606</col>
for trial to Russia. We would like to know what has been done with those people. An attempt was made to assassinate the Governor of Ispahan, and his nephew was killed in his efforts to protect him. There, again, the murderers were taken charge of by the Russian Government.<lb/>
I quote these instances not to make any case against Russia, but to show what frightful odds the Persian Government have had to contend with. How can a Government control their subjects when they are denied the means by which alone good government can be carried on? It is rather hard to accuse the new-born Persian Government of having failed to preserve order in that very difficult country of access in Southern Persia when they have not been given a free hand. I believe honestly that they have done their best, and that if they had only been given a greater command of funds they would have been able to preserve order. It will be remembered that we stated that if we had to take charge of the police force on the Persian Gulf we should demand a surtax of ten per cent. on the Customs duties. I cannot see why the Persian Government themselves should not have been allowed to raise that ten per cent. and administer the country properly. Why should we be so suspicious of their ability to administer properly funds entrusted to them? it is this which makes it so difficult for the Persian Government to carry on their affairs in a proper manner.<lb/>
I understand from other sources that there is possibly a brighter day dawning for the Persian Government, and that there is a possibility now of their being allowed to obtain loans by which to carry on their administration. I believe they are going to appoint five American advisers to superintend their financial affairs. All these are good auguries for the future of the country, and under the guidance of the Regent I believe there is a possibility of the salvation of Persia. If only they would sink their own petty differences and act up to the doctrines of their own Islamic creed, that no country can be saved except by the action of her own people, I do believe there would be an independent Persia established which would be the best possible bulwark against any friction between Russia and ourselves. On the point of gun-running in the Persian Gulf Lord Curzon made a fine and dignified appeal to the French nation, but the noble Viscount opposite rather let him down
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0329"/>
<col>607</col>
when he asked what instance there was, of a country ever giving up an advantage without a <i>quid pro quo</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01323"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: Giving up Treaty rights.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01324"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAM1NGTON </member><membercontribution>: But if Treaty rights are an infringement of the ordinary laws of civilisation, surely it is not too much to expect one of the foremost civilised countries to co-operate in putting an end to this traffic. The noble Lord referred to Muscat. He might have referred also to Jibuti, which I understand is the very centre of this traffic in the distribution of arms. Time after time we have attempted to negotiate with the French nation on this matter, and I should have thought that this was a very opportune occasion, the <i>entente cordiale</i> being so firmly established, when we might represent to them strongly that the whole of this gun-running traffic should, if possible, be put an end to. Only last week there was an attack on the coast between an armed dhow of our own and a dhow engaged in running arms. That dhow came from Jibuti. There are no Treaty rights there, and there is no reason why, with the assistance of the French nation, an end could not be put to the whole of this trade.<lb/>
The statement which the noble Viscount made with regard to the Baghdad Railway I regard as very satisfactory. Our chief concern is with the section from Baghdad to the Gulf; and if the German company have now got the branch down to Alexandretta, I should have thought there was every occasion for our now establishing good relations with the Germans in regard to this matter. Our one concern is, as I have said, in respect of the last section from Baghdad to the Gulf. One would like to know the views of His Majesty's Government on this matter, whether they consider that that section should ever be built, or whether our trade would not be benefited at a far less cost by simply improving the navigation of the Tigris. That, at all events for many years to come, would carry all the trade, represented by a million sterling per annum in value, that would go by that route. This seems a favourable opportunity not only to extend friendship with Russia, but also to put our own relations with Germany on a good footing in this matter. If we have a proper share of that last section to the Gulf, I do not think we need ask for any
<col>608</col>
more, except that the extension from Baghdad to Khanikin should be safeguarded so that there are no unfavourable rates by which our trade could be injured. I hope that this debate will put the whole of the questions that have been raised by the noble Lord on a clearer and better footing, and that we shall thereby establish better relations in that part of the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01325"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think it would be quite fitting that we should allow the very important statement which the noble Viscount has made to your Lordships to pass without any comment from those who formed part of the late Government in respect to what they had to do in relation to the matters upon which the noble Viscount dwelt. I speak with a full sense of the great difficulty of dealing with these delicate subjects of foreign policy in public debate, and perhaps it would not have been necessary for me to say a word at all upon the subject but for the fact that the noble Viscount appeared to me to be desirous of defending the very important step in policy which His Majesty's Government are evidently undertaking by throwing a certain responsibility for the situation upon the predecessors of the present Government. There was a sort of covered attack by the noble Viscount upon the attitude which we adopted in respect to the Baghdad&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01326"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: It was raised by the noble Lord or I should not have mentioned it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01327"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member><membercontribution>: I do not agree with the noble Viscount. My noble friend Lord Curzon spoke, as I thought in very proper terms, of the attitude which we had adopted in respect of the Baghdad Railway in former times. There was no call for the noble Viscount to have brought our conduct into question, unless it be necessary in order to defend his own policy that he should reflect adversely upon ours. I do not desire to treat this subject in any aggressive spirit, but I think it necessary to place upon record what, in fact, the late Government did.<lb/>
Now what did the late Government do? The noble Viscount, not quite correctly, spoke as if we had refused to come to an arrangement about the Baghdad Railway. That was not an absolutely correct statement of the case, because as a matter of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0330"/>
<col>609</col>
fact the persons who refused to come to an arrangement were the members of the financial groups concerned. Undoubtedly they were in close relations with the then Government all through the negotiations, and the matter we had to decide was whether British interests were properly treated in the arrangements that were proposed on behalf of the German group. That was the question. It was stated by my noble friend Lord Lansdowne at the time, and these are the words he used&#x2014;
<quote>"What was under our consideration was the possibility of obtaining the substitution for this purely German system of a line of an international character, constructed under guarantees which would have secured permanently its international character, and which would have secured for the commerce of all nations absolutely free and equal treatment from sea to sea."</quote>
The noble Marquess went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"It was also part of the proposals which were ventilated that this country should be given full equality with any other Power in respect of the construction of the line, and in respect of its maintenance and control after it had been constructed."</quote>
That was the ideal which His Majesty's then Government were favourable to. That was the proposal which was not offered to us, and therefore it was not possible for the then Government to support and, endorse the arrangement which was made.<lb/>
The noble Viscount thinks that we were wrong in the decision we came to. That is a matter only of historical interest. The noble Viscount may be right, and we may have been wrong. All I say is that we acted according to the best of our ability, and according to what, in our judgment, were the interests of our country. I gather that the noble Viscount and his colleagues do not view the matter from precisely the same point of view. I touch on this subject with great diffidence, but certainly the sort of outline which the noble Viscount gave of the proposals which are under the consideration of the Government did not seem to place our country on a precisely equal footing with that of other countries. He divided, very properly, the Baghdad Railway into two divisions&#x2014;the Gulf section and the rest. I think it is possible that the sort of arrangement which His Majesty's Government are contemplating is that the greater part of the Baghdad Railway should be made without any positive position being accorded to this country in respect of it,
<col>610</col>
but that in respect of the Gulf section we should hold an important position. Until we have an opportunity of seeing precisely what the terms are it would be most improper to in any way condemn them; but I would ask His Majesty's Government to remember that they do hold a very strong position in this matter&#x2014;namely the very strong position to which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in another place has called the attention of the country. They hold the position and the power given to them by the fact that they can refuse or admit the raising of the necessary revenue by the Turkish Government which is essential for the project to be carried out at all. They hold that power as trustees for the country, and I earnestly hope that they will not make terms, or allow terms to be made, adverse to this country whilst they have the power to prevent it. It they do, upon them must rest the responsibility.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01328"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are only one or two points in the speech of the noble Viscount to which I may, perhaps, be allowed for one moment to refer. With the general tone and tenor of his speech I have nothing to express except gratification. I agree with him that a new chapter in the history of the East is likely to be opened if events follow the course which he indicated; and if the opening phases of that chapter are pursued in that tone of gravity and of friendly regard for the interests of all the Powers concerned which characterised his speech to-night, then I think we may hope that the solution will be a favourable one.<lb/>
The points to which I desire for one moment to call attention are these. First, with regard to Persia. The noble Viscount read out <i>verbatim</i> the familiar assurance of the last Shah but one, Nasr-un-din, about concessions to Great Britain for railways in Southern Persia. I imagined that he was going on from that to say either that a concession for a British railway would be applied for, or that, if it was applied for, the project would receive the warm support of His Majesty's Government; but, on the contrary, the noble Viscount proceeded to make&#x2014;and as it was read I am sure it was a very formal and authorised statement&#x2014;a declaration to the effect that, provided strategical and commercial considerations can be satisfied by an adequate British participation in any railway schemes
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0331"/>
<col>611</col>
of the Persian Government in Southern Persia, His Majesty's Government would not construe their preferential rights in any exclusive spirit. I quite understand that position, but it is an apparent abandonment of the preferential rights which His Majesty's Government enjoy. It is not saying, as Sir Edward Grey rather suggested in the House of Commons, that if the Russians make a railway in Northern Persia we should respond by making an application in respect of Southern Persia. It only says that if the Persian Government make a railway in Southern Persia and that railway does not strategically interfere with our interests, we shall co-operate with them. I hope that will not be interpreted by anybody as in the slightest degree weakening the assurance given us by the Shah, or as disabling us in future from translating that pledge into action should occasion arise.<lb/>
As to the Persian Gulf, I was glad to hear the noble Viscount adhere with so much emphasis to the statement made by Lord Lansdowne in May, 1903. On the matter of the Muscat Treaty, I agree with the observations made by the noble Lord behind me, Lord Lamington. I put this to the noble Viscount when he speaks about Treaty rights&#x2014;Does he really contend that the Treaty rights which were contemplated when the Treaty of Muscat was effected cover or justify the sort of traffic which they are now held to extenuate? These are not Treaty rights enjoyed by French subjects in the ordinary sense of the term. When I was in India they were Treaty rights taken advantage of by two persons only, French merchants engaged in this traffic, who were protected by their country because they possessed important commercial interests in France. Are we to be told that in a case of that sort the French Government, as a matter of international practice, cannot give way without receiving territorial compensation in some other part of the world? I earnestly hope that they would be ashamed to ask for it; but, if they do ask for it, I hope His Majesty's Government will not be too generous in meeting them on the matter.<lb/>
The noble Viscount dealt with the attitude of the late Government with regard to the Baghdad Railway in 1903. I will only say with regard to the new arrangement, the facts of which the noble Viscount put before us, that we shall look
<col>612</col>
with great interest to see exactly what is the share in the new company from Baghdad to the Gulf which is to be claimed by the old German company. The German company affects to surrender its concession in return for the substantial advantages it gets at Alexandretta, but, nevertheless, it is to retain a share in whatever company is formed to construct the line from Baghdad to the Gulf. When the noble Viscount said that His Majesty's Government were prepared, if a solution was proposed satisfactory to this country, to use their influence with the Sheikh of Koweit for the provision of a suitable terminus for the railway at the port of Koweit, I do not think he was saying anything different from the position taken up by Lord Lansdowne in 1903. The Government at that time gave a somewhat similar assurance. I ask His Majesty's Government before they embark upon this project for the extension of the railway to the Gulf to satisfy themselves that the last section from Basra to the Gulf is wanted in the interests of anybody. Is it wanted in the interests of the Turkish Government? Is it wanted in the interests of British trade or of Indian trade? Let His Majesty's Government remember that this section will be an expensive one to construct. For a distance of nearly 100 miles it would cross a desert. Then you get down to Koweit itself. I know the harbour very well, and I know that a good deal of harbour work would be required before the place could be made ready for the accommodation of our ships, and therefore you have a very great outlay laid upon your new company there, every fresh outlay deepening the heavy financial obligations which the Turkish Government have been foolish enough to incur in regard to the earlier sections of the line. And how silly every one would look if, after the line was built, you found goods from India still being transferred into boats, still going up the river to Basra, and very likely on to Baghdad. I suggest the point to His Majesty's Government as one worthy of their consideration. After all, business has a good deal to say in these matters, and I merely warn the Government to look at them from a business point of view. I have now only to thank the noble Viscount for the Papers which he has kindly promised to lay on the Table of the House, and to, withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BRITISH INTERESTS IN JAPAN AND<lb/> KOREA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01361"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Whether the decision of the Hague Tribunal with regard to perpetual leases to foreign residents in Japan has been fully put into effect; and</li>
<li>2. Whether, in view of the change in the <i>status</i> of Korea, His Majesty's Government propose to take measures to protect British interests in that country; and to move for Papers.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01362">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government the Questions standing:in my name. The question of perpetual leases as they are called is exercising the minds of British residents in Japan to no inconsiderable extent. As your Lordships are no doubt aware, by the old law of Japan foreigners were forbidden to hold land in that country, and in order to overcome the difficulty the Japanese Government forty or fifty years ago instituted a system of what is called perpetual leases&#x2014;granting, that is to say, areas of land in each of the three chief ports of Japan&#x2014;Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagasaki&#x2014;for the purpose of forming foreign settlements in those cities. These leases were granted to private individuals and carried with them immunity from the Land Taxes, an arrangement which was confirmed by agreements made with the Governments of foreign Powers. Recently the Japanese Government held that the
<col>618</col>
new House Tax was not included in the exemption. The question was discussed at considerable length in Japan, and after considerable delay the matter was referred to the Arbitration Court at the Hague, and this Court finally gave a verdict against, the Japanese Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01363">This verdict was given four or five years ago, and the Japanese Government have recently instituted laws complying with the ruling of the Hague Court, but I understand that subsidiary questions which hang upon this judgment are still outstanding, and this is a matter which is naturally depreciating the value of the leases held by British subjects. These leases were confirmed, as I have said, by Treaties with the foreign Governments, and there is a considerable feeling of uneasiness among British residents in the Far East that His Majesty's Government intend to give up the leases in return for concessions in the new Japanese Tariff. These leases were granted to private individuals and were bought by them at a price largely in excess of the current value of adjacent lands in virtue of the immunity from taxation. While, therefore, additional security is given to these leases, they are not totally dependent upon the maintenance of the Treaties between the Powers&#x2014;a point which is confirmed by a Memorandum from Sir Ernest Satow, then British Minister in Tokyo, to Viscount Aoki, soon after these Treaties came into force; in which he stated&#x2014;
<quote>"If no stipulation on the subject had been made in the Treaty of 1804, justice and good faith would call for the observance of the contractual obligations thus created between the Japanese Government and the foreign renters."</quote>
It is clear, therefore, that while His Majesty's Government may properly be called upon to protect the rights granted to British subjects, they have no right to give up or modify those rights without the consent of the private owners concerned. I venture to hope that in the reply which will be given to-day on their behalf His Majesty's Government will be able to allay the misgivings of British residents in Japan by satisfactory assurances on these points.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01364">In my second Question I ask whether in view of the change in the <i>status</i> of Korea, His Majesty's Government propose to take measures to protect British interests in that country. The Preamble of the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0335"/>
<col>619</col>
Anglo-Japanese Agreement of January 30, 1902, runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The Governments of Great Britain and Japan, actuated solely by a desire to maintain the status quo and general peace in the Extreme East, being moreover specially interested in maintaining the independence and territorial integrity of the Empire of China and the Empire of Korea, and in securing equal opportunities in those countries for the commerce and industry of all nations, agree as follows:"</quote>
Then came the Russo-Japanese War, and in the Agreement which was concluded at the termination of that war naturally the Empire of Korea was no longer referred to as such, but the policy of the open door was perpetuated in the new Agreement; for Article III of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement of August 12, 1905, is as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"Japan possessing paramount political, military, and economic interests in Korea, Great Britain recognises the right of Japan to take such measures of guidance, control, and protection in Korea as she may deem proper and necessary to safeguard and advance those interests, provided always that such measures are not contrary to the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations."</quote>
This was followed by the Convention of November 17, 1905, some months after peace was signed, in which Japan assumed the entire control of the foreign affairs of Korea, and undertook the duty of watching over the execution of the Treaties actually existing between Korea and the Powers; and five days later a circular Note was addressed to the Powers in which the Imperial Government of Japan declared that&#x2014;
<quote>"in assuming charge of the foreign relations of Korea and undertaking the duty of watching over the existing Treaties of that country they will see that those Treaties are maintained and respected, and they also engage not to prejudice in any way the legitimate commercial and industrial interests of these Powers in Korea."</quote>
Finally on August 29 of last year the annexation of Korea by Japan was announced, and by a Declaration issued on the same day it was stated that the Treaties with foreign Powers ceased to be operative in consequence of annexation, and that Japan's existing Treaties would as far as practicable be applied to Korea. Extraterritorial rights were abolished and the tariff and coastal trade for foreign ships was to be permitted as before for a period of ten years. Several precedents have been advanced for the claim that the act of
<col>620</col>
annexation of itself cancelled all Treaties formally existing between the Empire of Korea and foreign Powers. In the case of Madagascar, which presents the closest analogy, it was only after vigorous protestations by the late Lord Salisbury that England accepted the attitude adopted by France, and she has never relinquished the principle that succession to rights involves succession to responsibilities. But in all three cases&#x2014;that of Hawaii, of Texas, and of Madagascar&#x2014;the country annexing territory had in no case made itself previously responsible for the foreign policy of the country it annexed or solemnly pledged itself to watch over existing Treaties, as did Japan in the case of Korea. I venture to think that your Lordships will agree that this fact very materially affects the question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01365">And now as to how far the claim to cancel Treaties formerly in existence is likely to affect British interests in Korea. It would seem reasonable to suppose that if extraterritorial rights are unnecessary in Japan, they can hardly be considered necessary in a country under the same Government just across the Straits of Tsushima. But the circumstances in the two countries are so entirely different that no comparison can be made between the two. Japan is faced with untold difficulties. Imagine a country situated somewhat in the geographical position of the Channel Islands inhabited by what is considered an inferior race of a childlike and hopeless simplicity. It is obvious that the dregs of humanity in our great cities would be anxious to emigrate thither to exploit those people for their own advantage, and this is exactly what has happened in Korea. An undesirable class of emigrant gives rise to situations with which the authorities with the best will in the world must be unable to cope.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01366">Nor is this all. Korea is at present not under similar laws to Japan, but under military jurisdiction. Again, there is not in Japan freedom of the Press as we understand it; but there is no semblance whatever of freedom of the Press in Korea. Four out of the seven newspapers which existed. there six months ago have been abolished, and recently the remaining three papers were notified that all communications to the Press and to the public would be made by the Governor-General of Korea and by
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0336"/>
<col>621</col>
no other authority. If all Japanese officials and colonists were of the high character of the late Prince Ito, of the present Governor-General, General Terauchi, or of Mr. Nabeshima, there would, of course, be nothing to urge against this abolition of extra-territorial rights, but it is impossible that they should he able to secure British residents from circumstances which they would wish to avoid if possible. There is this further point with regard to extraterritorial rights. Not only are the emigrants of a character who might give evidence in Courts which would not be substantiated, but naturally some of the officials are of a similar character; and communications in Korea being still extremely backward many minor points of law have been handed over to the <i>gendarmerie</i> for adjudication instead of to the Courts. By an Order in Council of January 23 last this country has recognised the abolition of extra-territorial rights in Korea, but I think your Lordships would wish to know whether any qualification was made as to the standing of the Court before which British subjects should be tried.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01367">I turn to the question of trade and commerce. The imports of Great Britain into Korea are about eighteen or nineteen per cent. of the whole, and three years ago were estimated at &#x00A3;700,000. The inter-coastal trade is also very considerable. By the Proclamation issued on annexation Japan limits the policy of the open door to a period of ten years, at which time she may apparently impose any tariff she pleases, and forbid, as she has done in Japan, any inter-coastal trade by British ships&#x2014;a policy which will bring to an end all British trade in that region. British subjects in Korea are anxious about yet another point&#x2014;the ownership of land. They fear that they may be forbidden to own land in Korea as they have so long been forbidden to own land in Japan, and they object to the Regulation recently promulgated that in the event of any dispute the question must be referred to a Land Inspection Committee and not to a Court of Law. It is obvious that foreigners may have their interests handed over to a committee without any possibility of appeal to a higher Court, and that injustice in that way may be done. Mining rights, also, are in a somewhat uncertain condition. There are great possibilities in connection with mining in Korea, and already several
<col>622</col>
foreign countries have started there and I believe are being extremely successful. But there, again, the companies are in doubt as to what their future will be, and whether these mining rights will continue to be conceded to them. The question is complicated by the Korean Company Act of December 29 last year, by which no company may be formed in Korea until the approval of the Governor-General has been obtained. This law, though extremely autocratic in operation, will, no doubt, tend to the prevention of bogus companies and the exploitation of the unfortunate Korean, but it should receive attention in so far as it affects the legitimate rights of British subjects.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01368">Next I turn to the withdrawal of the British Consul from Antung. Antung is on the Yalu River, and is now the chief boundary town between what is virtually Japan and China. By an Agreement, very loosely worded as they constantly are, between China and Russia the former Government granted a rebate of three-tenths of the Customs Duty on her imports over the Manchurian border as a set-off against the necessarily heavy freight charges of the railway. Japan has obtained most-favoured-nation terms for the trade between Manchuria and Korea by an Agreement with China dated December 22, 1905. At present Japanese goods are shipped direct to Antung, and no rebate has been demanded. It is possible, however, that a line twenty-nine miles long from the mouth of the Yalu River will shortly be built and the bridge across the Yalu will shortly be completed. It is possible that rebate may then be charged, although the freight charges on the railway will, of course, be infinitesimal. It is felt, therefore, that a British representative should be re-appointed to Antung to watch developments, and that representations should be made before proposals so injurious to British trade are put forward. It is impossible to forecast with accuracy the future of the Far East. But if the feeling is allowed to gain ground that His Majesty's Government cares not, and it will speedily be translated into dares not, to uphold British interests such as those I have put forward, it will go far towards undermining and destroying British influence throughout the Far East and the Orient.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01369">There is one further point. Sir Edward
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0337"/>
<col>623</col>
Grey, in a speech which he recently delivered in another place, made a statement with which I think every member of this House is in cordial agreement. I refer to his desire that this country should draw closer to the United States of America. By the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Great Britain is bound to make war in common with Japan for the preservation of Japan's territorial rights in the Far East. When that Alliance was signed Korea was not even a Protectorate of Japan. Manchuria at the present day is not a part of the Japanese Empire. Japan at that time had guaranteed equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of all nations in Korea, and she has made similar protestations with regard to Manchuria. It is possible&#x2014;in fact, those who know the Far East best consider it probable&#x2014;that some day Japan may be inclined to take similar action with regard to South Manchuria. We all know that the United States have considerable interests in that region, and they place so much importance upon them that Mr. Knox recently went so far as to suggest the neutralisation of all railways in that region to conserve as far as possible the question of the open door. My Lords, Korea may form a dangerous precedent. a precedent difficult to withstand when applied to Manchuria; and this country may either have to make explanations and withdrawals which once again will earn for us the name of <i>la perfide Albion</i>, or make war on a nation bound to us by every tie of common language and of common origin&#x2014;a nation whose interests are identical with our own in the Far East. I apologise for having detained your Lordships so long, and I beg to move the Motion standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01370">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the decision of the Hague Tribunal with regard to perpetual leases to foreign residents in Japan; and also as to the protection of British interests in view of the change in the status of Korea.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Stanhope.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01371"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before replying to the Questions which stand on the Paper in the name of the noble Earl, I hope I may be permitted, without its being thought impertinent on the part of a very junior Member of your Lordships' House, to say how extremely glad I am sure
<col>624</col>
every member of this House feels at seeing the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition once more in his place.<lb/>
The first Question on the Paper is whether the decision of the Hague Tribunal with regard to perpetual leases to foreign residents in Japan has been fully put into effect. The Award of the Hague Tribunal, given on May 22, 1905, laid down that the Treaties concluded between this country, France, and Germany on the one hand and Japan on the other hand exempted from all taxes or payments of any kind except those contemplated in the Treaties all land held by British, French, or German subjects on perpetual lease; and not only all land, but also all buildings upon such land, whether they were already constructed or to be constructed in the future. The Award referred to taxes imposed on the properties in question, but did not expressly refer to taxes imposed in respect of the properties in question. The Japanese Government accordingly proceeded to levy State and Municipal Income Tax assessed on properties held under perpetual lease, on the ground that Income Tax was a personal tax; but as the action of the Japanese Government indicated that they placed a different interpretation upon the Award from that placed upon it by the three Powers, the Powers felt that it was eminently desirable to have a clear and definite statement of the taxes and charges from which the land renters could, in view of the Award, claim exemption. In the meanwhile the levying of the taxes above referred to has been suspended, and an informal exchange of views is actually taking place with the Japanese Government in the hope of arriving at a satisfactory settlement of the question. I feel sure that in these circumstances the noble Earl will readily understand that it is impossible for the moment to make a more detailed statement on this point.<lb/>
I now turn to the second Question, which is whether, in view of the change in the <i>status</i> of Korea, His Majesty's Government propose to take measures to protect British interests in that Country. First of all let me say that the Secretary of State is fully alive to the question of British interests in Korea, and he is doing, and will do, everything which may be possible or practicable to promote those interests. I should like to state very briefly what is the position, broadly speaking, at present.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0338"/>
<col>625</col>
The Japanese Government, in explaining the motives which led them to undertake the complete annexation of Korea, gave certain assurances. Firstly, they gave the assurance that as the Treaties between Korea and other Powers ceased to be operative, Japan's existing Treaties would, as far as possible, be applied to Korea. Foreign residents in Korea would, so far as conditions permitted, enjoy the same rights and immunities as in Japan proper, and they would also enjoy the protection of their legally-acquired rights subject in all cases to the jurisdiction of Japan. Secondly, they undertook to continue the existing Tariff arrangements for a period of ten years. Thirdly, for a similar period, vessels under the flags of Powers having Treaties with Japan would be permitted to engage in the coastal trade between the open ports of Korea and any open ports of Japan. And, lastly, the existing open ports of Korea, with the exception of Masampo and with the addition of Shinwiju, would continue to be open ports. As to foreign settlements, jurisdiction over British subjects, prisons, and other kindred questions, His Majesty's Government informed the Japanese Government on December 16 last, in consultation with His Majesty's Embassy at Tokyo, that they were willing to leave these matters to the sense of justice and good faith of the Japanese officials on the spot. Satisfactory assurances have already been received from the Japanese Government on the question of land tenure, and also on the question of ownership and the working of mines. With regard to the present Tariff, as I have already said it was to be continued for a period of ten years, and it is clearly impossible to ask the Japanese Government to definitely commit themselves in advance to a continuation of the present arrangement after the term specified.<lb/>
With regard to the withdrawal of the British Vice-Consul from Antung, this took place for purely Service reasons. In December, 1909, His Majesty's Minister at Peking reported that the British political and commercial interests at Antung were, in his opinion, insufficient to warrant the permanent residence of a Consular officer in that place, and it was considered that these interests could be sufficiently protected by periodical visits from Mukden. However, quite recently&#x2014;at the end of last month&#x2014;His Majesty's Minister in
<col>626</col>
Peking has been asked whether he has had any reason to modify this opinion during the past year, and I need hardly say that when his answer arrives it will receive full consideration. I think that is all I am able to say on the present occasion. With regard to the Motion for Papers, I am desired to say that the Secretary of State does not see his way for the present to lay Papers on the Table of your Lordships' House, but that as soon as these various matters have been definitely settled he will consider the question of laying whatever Papers he may be able to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01372"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON:</member><membercontribution>My Lords, as one who has taken great interest for many years in Korea and who is still more interested in the Treaty rights of British subjects and notably of British traders in those parts of the world, I should like to add a few words. In the first place, I am sure we shall all agree in thanking the noble Earl for having raised this question. He did so, if I may be permitted to say it, with a wide knowledge of the facts, with perfect fairness, and with a correct appreciation of the issues he was placing before the House. The noble Lord who has replied has given us the information which he was no doubt instructed to lay, but he will pardon me for saying that it does not cover the whole of the ground and does not remove the apprehensions which my noble friend behind me expressed. In fact, a good deal of the information given us by the noble Lord, if not beside the point&#x2014;and I will not say that&#x2014;was irrelevant to the particular fears entertained by my noble friend.<lb/>
I need not say anything about the first Question. I would not desire to push the noble Lord further than the point to which he went in replying to the Question concerning lands that have been leased in perpetuity in Japan. A point of great importance, however, is raised by our Treaty rights in Korea as affected by the recent action of Japan. What has been going on in the past few years in Korea? During the last seven years there has been a steady progression in the hold which Japan has acquired over that unhappy country. In 1904 a Treaty was concluded by which Korea promised to follow the advice of Japan as regards administrative improvements, and in which Japan undertook to maintain the integrity and independence of the Korean Empire. Then in 1905, after the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0339"/>
<col>627</col>
war between Russia and Japan, there was another Treaty in which Japan assumed control of the foreign relations of Korea and pledged herself, in language differing somewhat from the former Treaty, to maintain the dignity and the welfare of the Korean Throne. The next step was in 1907, when Korea placed herself under Japanese suzerainty, and administrative authority was transferred from her to the dominion Power. And the last step&#x2014;in July, 1910&#x2014;was when Korea was finally annexed by Japan.<lb/>
Thus there has been during the last seven years a progressive tightening of the hold on Korea by Japan. I am not for one moment complaining of that. Korea has been one of the most unhappy of all nations in the world. She has been a sort of football kicked about by the Powers of the East, and that at last she should be steered through the goal-posts of Japan is in all probability in the long run the best thing that could happen to her. Neither do I desire to say anything about the manner in which Japan has executed her self-imposed task. What I am concerned with, and exclusively concerned with, are the rights of British subjects in Korea, guaranteed by Treaties and calling for defence on the part of His Majesty's Government. The noble Earl referred to the Second Treaty concluded between Japan and ourselves in the year 1905, and he quoted these words, which the House will perhaps permit me to repeat&#x2014;
<quote>"Japan possessing paramount political, military, and economic interests in Korea, Great Britain recognises the right of Japan to take such measures of guidance, control, and protection in Korea as she may deem proper and necessary to safeguard and advance those interests, provided always that such measures are not contrary to the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations."</quote>
It is the last words to which I call attention. The noble Earl alluded also to the circular Letter to the Powers that. was issued at the same time as the Treaty of 1905 was concluded. This was the Letter in which the Japanese Government, in assuming control of the foreign affairs of Korea, declared that they would see that in assuming charge of those relations the Treaties existing between Korea and the Treaty Powers should be maintained and respected, and they also engaged not to prejudice in any way the legitimate commercial and industrial interests of those Powers in Korea. That was the state of
<col>628</col>
affairs as regards public international pledges up to 1905.<lb/>
Then we come to annexation in 1910, and at this stage Japan claimed that annexation should carry with it an abrogation of all existing Treaties. Here we raise on the one hand a question of international law, and on the other hand a question of practical importance for our own people. On the question of international law, no one has argued with greater force in times past than the present Foreign Secretary himself, Sir Edward Grey, that, whatever territorial changes might be effected, the economic <i>status quo</i>, the principle of the open door and of equal opportunities to the commerce of all nations, ought to be respected. The noble Earl behind me alluded to the negotiations that followed the annexation of Madagascar by France in 1899, and, while pointing out the analogy between those circumstances and the present, he rightly told us that the analogy was not. a perfect one. But I remember nothing better, having been Lord Salisbury's Under-Secretary at the time, than this, that when France annexed Madagascar Sir Edward Grey went round the country saying that we as a Government had no right to allow the Treaty rights we enjoyed with Madagascar to be abrogated by that act of annexation by France unless we obtained a substantial <i>quid pro quo</i>. In a speech at Liverpool on January 20, 1899, these were Sir Edward Grey's words&#x2014;
<quote>"Lie did not believe that trade followed the flag, but what was no doubt true was that where the flag of other nations went British trade might be excluded. An instance of that was to be found in Madagascar. All they desired in regard to the matter was to request France to respect our Treaty rights, or, if our Treaty rights were to be extinguished, to see that they were only extinguished in return for compensation elsewhere. What had happened in Madagascar might happen on a much larger scale in China. They would continue to do their best, and would stand up and ask that the influence of this country should be used in favour of the policy of the open door."</quote>
That was what Sir Edward Grey said in 1899. Yet if I correctly apprehend the position, when Japan annexed Korea in 1910 His Majesty's Government do not appear to have made any fight for a <i>quid pro quo</i>. As far as I can understand, they have surrendered the whole position; they have&#x2014;nothing has been said to the contrary&#x2014;acquiesced in the annexation; they have surrendered our extra-territorial rights, and, if I am right, disabled themselves from any further action in the matter.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0340"/>
<col>629</col>
What is the present position? It has been explained to us by the noble Earl in his speech just now. You have&#x2014;I am not complaining of Japan in the matter&#x2014;Law Courts and Police Courts set up to which British subjects have to take their cases, which are far below the standards of those that exist in any civilised countries, or even in Japan itself. You have a position as regards land holding, mining concessions, and so on, which is, at any rate, somewhat precarious; and you have an engagement as regards the tariff, that the present tariff shall only remain in operation for ten years. The noble Lord who replied for the Government very properly said that it is not for him to prophesy what will happen ten years hence. That is perfectly true. But what I want to know is, What has His Majesty's Government been doing all this time? When it was known that annexation had taken place, did negotiations take place between the two Governments? Was any attempt made to stand up for the Treaty rights of Great Britain, or have we given away the whole thing? I should be the last upon incorrect information to blame His Majesty's Government, but we know nothing of what has happened. We merely have the bald facts that annexation has taken place, that extraterritoriality has been abolished, that our Treaty rights have been impaired, and that His Majesty's Government have apparently acquiesced in this arrangement. If this be the state of affairs, then I must confess that I think there has been some departure from the enunciation of high principle by Sir Edward Grey ten years and more ago. I might quote other passages from Sir Edward Grey's speeches, because I have many of them, in which he has over and over again insisted on the same point. I cannot pursue the matter now, because he is not here to answer me. But I do submit that the case is one that calls for a reply, that we owe a debt of gratitude to the noble Earl for having brought it before the House to-day, and that until further information is placed at our disposal we are justified in entertaining the opinion that there has been some sacrifice of British interests in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01373"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl beside me (Earl Stanhope) has brought forward a matter of great importance in a speech of considerable ability, and while I recognise that there are some points on which in existing circum
<col>630</col>
stances we cannot press His Majesty's Government for any further information, two points have been raised by the noble Earl on which I should like to say a few words. The first is as regards the coasting trade. I cannot help thinking that that is a matter which seriously deserves the attention of His Majesty's Government, not only as regards Japan, but also as regards some other countries. We know that we are excluded from the coasting trade both of France and of the United States. That is a very serious matter, and I am rather disposed to think that it does more injury to France and to the United States than it does to us. But there can be no question that it does sonic injury to us also.<lb/>
In Germany the law is much fairer. In Germany they also have a law that the coasting trade is reserved to German vessels, but there is a proviso that where any country allows German vessels to share the coasting trade of that country, then the German Government gives the same privileges to vessels of that country in connection with their own coasting trade; and as we allow German vessels to carry goods between ports in this country, I believe I am correct in saying that Germany allows us the same privilege in regard to'German ports. I cannot help thinking that it would be very desirable if His Majesty's Government would raise this question wherever we are deprived of coasting rights; and we may fairly point out to a foreign Government that it is unfair that we should allow them to trade from one British port to another and that they should prevent us from trading from one of their ports to another; and the example of Germany might be brought forward as a fair way of dealing with this question.<lb/>
With reference to the duties in Korea in the future, the Council of the London Chamber of Commerce have passed a unanimous resolution calling the attention of His Majesty's Government to the injury which might be inflicted on our commerce with Korea under the annexation. Of course it may be said, and said quite truly, that the case of Madagascar is not exactly upon all fours with this of Korea, but still it is one of a very similar character, and we know that our trade in Madagascar suffered very much when that country was
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0341"/>
<col>631</col>
annexed by France. It is, of course, quite open to France, or to Germany, or to any foreign country, to make any changes in her own duties which she may think to her advantage, and as a Free Trader I am bound to believe that in doing so she inflicts more injury upon herself than she does upon us. But it is a different thing when a country like France annexes Madagascar, or a country like Japan annexes Korea. There the duties did not stand at all upon the same footing, and surely it is somewhat unfair that French goods should be admitted to Egypt on the same terms as ours and vet our goods should be excluded from Madagascar unless they pay high duties to France.<lb/>
Now we have very nearly the same question raised with regard to Korea, and, as I say, in the City of London we are a good deal exercised in our minds as to the injury which may be inflicted upon our commerce by these arrangements. It is, no doubt, some advantage that there should be the undertaking that the duties will not be raised for ten years, but, after all, in the history of nations ten years is but a very short time, and when you get towards the end of the period the uncertainty of what may happen will have a very serious effect. My noble friend who replied on behalf of His Majesty's Government said he did not think we could ask for anything more. But, after all, we had something to give. We had to consent to the annexation of Korea, and it seems to me, as it did to the noble Lord below me (Lord Curzon) and to the noble Earl who brought forward this subject, that we ought not to have agreed to any arrangements of that kind without serious protest and without doing everything to protect our commercial interests. Japan, of course, is quite entitled to raise her own duties as much as she pleases; but it is a different thing when we have to consider the question of Japan raising the duties in Korea, and we are afraid in the City of London that the arrangement which has been made will be very detrimental to our trade in Korea. I do not know how far the matter may have gone, but if it is possible to make any strong remonstrance on the subject I venture to hope that His Majesty's Government will do so.</membercontribution></p>

<col>632</col>
that His Majesty's Government will produce Papers on as early an opportunity as possible. There is, however, one point on which I should like to say a word&#x2014;namely, with regard to the Consul at Antung. It has happened on more than one occasion that we have allowed things to slide until the scheme has been definitely formulated and it is impossible for us to get as great privileges as might otherwise have been the case. It is obvious that if we wait until the harbour at the mouth of the Yalu is finished and the railway constructed, it will he difficult for us to object to a rebate being given to the Japanese. But if we put forward our plea now that the rebate is only given for very high freightage over a long distance of railway and that therefore it is not an analogy which can be compared with a railway line 29 miles long, I venture to think His Majesty's Government will be able to take up a much firmer attitude than if they wait until the whole matter is settled.</membercontribution></p>

This instance emphasises the complaint which I made last week that we ought to have a representative of the Foreign Office in this House. In the present case the noble Lord who replied for the Government has given the official answer to the noble Earl's Questions, but he is stumped when we put a simple question like this with regard to the laying of Papers. All we can do, therefore, is to ask the noble Lord and the noble Viscount the Leader of the House to be kind enough to convey our humble request to the Foreign Secretary to listen to what we have said this afternoon, perhaps to read our speeches, and to give us Papers if he can do so. I suppose it is no good pressing the Motion for Papers further; but I think my noble

<title>UNCERTIFICATED OFFICERS ON<lb/> MERCHANT SHIPS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01379"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose to call attention to the necessity of further legislation, within reasonable limits, ensuring that British merchant ships shall be commanded and officered by men who can produce adequate proof of their fitness for doing so in the shape of Board of Trade certificates as master or mate respectively; to allude to certain recommendations on this matter which were adopted by the Manning Committee; and to move for a Return of those official Board of Trade inquiries in this country, of Naval Courts, and of marine inquiries in our Colonies and Dependencies, or a synopsis of them, which have been issued since the Manning Committee concluded its deliberations, and which contain any material comments or statements relative to the dangerous and common practice of merchant ships being in charge of uncertificated and irresponsible masters and mates.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01380">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the question which stands in my name is one of grave importance, for it concerns the safety of life and property at sea. In nearly every occupation where men are entrusted with duties where default or neglect on their part may endanger life, it is taken for granted that they should be qualified to discharge these responsibilities and that they should hold a certificate of qualification and fitness, or a document of some similar kind, which will serve to ensure their responsibility and impress them with the nature of it. But the
<col>634</col>
British mercantile marine is a glaring exception. There is a deficiency of the law in this respect, and the magnitude of the evil is but seldom realised.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01381">In the first place. I may say that so long as a British ship is outside the three-mile limit of these shores, there is nothing incumbent upon her in law that she shall carry either a certificated master or a single certificated officer. I make an exception in the case of certain of our Colonies, such as Australia, where they will not countenance such a thing, and where they will not permit our ships to sail from their ports unless there are a sufficient number of certificated officers on board. Take, for instance, such a ship as the"Mauretania."It is permissible for her to proceed to sea with a full complement of crew and passengers, and carrying His Majesty's mails, with a certificated master and one certificated officer only. It is fortunate for the safety of our seamen and the seagoing public that companies such as that which owns the"Mauretania"fully realise how inadequate the law is in this respect and who, far beyond their legal responsibilities, ensure that their ships shall be commanded and officered by an adequate supply of certificated and responsible men. I will go even further. If the"Mauretania"were making a coasting voyage and did not happen to be carrying passengers, there is no obligation that she should carry a single certificated man, whether he be master or officer. As an actual matter of fact there are many large merchant vessels, both steam and sail, constantly trading round our coasts without a single certificated man on board. As showing how extraordinary the law is, we find that in the case of the fishing trawler, a small vessel, she is compelled to carry a certificated skipper and secondhand. A second-hand is equivalent in a fishing vessel to a mate in another ship.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01382">So far back as the year 1896 the Committee appointed by the Board of Trade to inquire into the mantling of British merchant ships commented as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"It is truly an anomalous state of things under which a fishing vessel with a certificated skipper and second-hand may incur the risk of being run down by a large steamer in the home trade, which has not a single certificated person on board, or one the efficiency of whose eyesight has been officially tested and certified."</quote>
The Manning Committee, on the conclusion of their deliberations, stated that they
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0343"/>
<col>635</col>
were strongly of opinion that no vessel of large size or power should be permitted to go to sea unless provision had been made that the deck should always be in charge of some person who had given proof of his qualifications for such a position. They regarded the question as one closely allied to manning, and one urgently demanding legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01383">Your Lordships will appreciate what urgency has been attached to the matter by the Board of Trade when we find things in exactly the same position now as they were in 1896. Ten years later the Government passed the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906. While that measure was passing through your Lordships' House I proposed an Amendment which would have given effect to the recommendations of the Manning Committee. But the Board of Trade through their representative in your Lordships' House, though sympathising with the Amendment, said that they could not agree to it, on the lame excuse that its scope was too large for inclusion in the Bill. Time has gone on, and case after case has arisen where the scandal of allowing merchant vessels to be commanded and officered by uncertificated men has been exposed over and over again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01384">I will not task your forbearance by quoting these various cases, but I will briefly allude to two or three of the latest. One of these is where the cargo steamer"Paragon,"in charge of an uncertificated man, sank the pilot steamer"Excelsior,"loss of life ensuing. The Court which investigated the circumstances attending the accident expressed the opinion that&#x2014;
<quote>"A man in sole charge of a steamship at night in a busy waterway, possessing no certificate of competency, is charged with a responsibility which should never be imposed on an officer without full professional qualifications:'</quote>
It is not long ago that the steamer"India,"the master and mate of which were both uncertificated, sank the sailing ship"Kate Thomas,"when nineteen lives were lost. In the course of the decision of the Board of Trade Inquiry into this catastrophe the Court expressed the decided opinion that for safe navigation those in charge of steam vessels such as the"India"should be certificated&#x2014;an opinion, I may remark, that very few would endeavour to dispute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01385">The latest case is that where the fishing boat"Alice"was sunk by the steamer
<col>636</col>
"Melissa,"which was in charge of an uncertificated man at the time. The Court found that the cause and the consequent loss of life was the absence from the deck of the"Melissa"of a responsible officer, and the neglect of that vessel to observe the Regulations for preventing collisions at sea. As it so happened, the master of the"Melissa"held a certificate, but was below at the time of the collision. The Court suspended his certificate for twelve months, and ordered that he should pay &#x00A3;50 towards the costs of the Inquiry. The following extract from the judgment of the Court is very significant&#x2014;
<quote>"The Court is aware that in suspending the certificate of the master it is inflicting a more or less nominal penalty, inasmuch as masters and mates of home trade ships not carrying passengers are not required to possess certificates of competency; and the Court is strongly of opinion that, in the interests of safe navigation, the time has come when all masters and mates in the home trade should be certificated."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01386">This matter is one upon which, very properly, I consider, the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, which represents over 15,000 certificated captains and officers, has agitated for many years past. They have appealed to me once more to refer to it in your Lordships' House, and I cannot but feel that they have absolute justice on their side. All these gentlemen have certificates at stake, and the suspension of a certificate is a very serious matter and may mean the ruin of a man's professional career. When they navigate our home waters they are exposed to undue and unfair risk when meeting vessels in charge of uncertificated and irresponsible men. I hear that, owing to constant pressure having been brought to bear upon them, the Board of Trade are now considering the framing of a measure which will deal with the situation. This I think we will all hail with considerable satisfaction and I sincerely trust that my noble friend representing the Board of Trade in this House will be good enough to give us some definite information upon the point. A measure of the kind must inevitably be introduced sooner or later, especially as, from what I am given to understand, the leading representatives of all the principal sections of shipping are in accord as to the necessity for it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01387">Perhaps my noble friend will also give us information as to what views on this matter have been communicated to the Board of Trade by the Merchant Shipping

<col>637</col>
Advisory Committee. Personally I am of opinion that so soon as a measure of the kind is introduced Parliament should be provided with the fullest information, which will enable us not only to realise the evidence in favour of the Bill, assuming, as I believe I am right in doing, that it will be under the sponsorship of His Majesty's Government, but information of the kind would disarm opposition and facilitate its passing through its various stages with the smallest trouble and in the least possible time. I have moved for a Return from the year 1896, as it was then that the Manning Committee declared that the matter urgently demanded legislation. If we had a Return reporting these cases of accidents at sea where the evils of uncertificated masters and officers have been referred to it would be enlightening to the members of both Houses of Parliament who may have to consider the measure, and, further, would be of the greatest use to His Majesty's Government as a complete justification for dealing with it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01388"><i>Moved</i>, That a Return be laid before the House of those official Board of Trade inquiries in this country, of Naval Courts, and of marine inquiries in our Colonies and Dependencies, or a synopsis of them, which have been issued since the Manning Committee concluded its deliberations, and which contain any material comments or statements relative to the dangerous and common practice of merchant ships being in charge of uncertificated and irresponsible masters and mates.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Muskerry.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01389"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is one of the questions which the noble Lord has frequently raised, but never, I think, since I have had the honour of answering for the Department. I may congratulate him on having put it down at this time because otherwise he might have been too late and the legislation to which he refers might have been already before your Lordships' House or the other House of Parliament. I am afraid that the noble Lord has not always derived much satisfaction from the official replies, but I am happy to think that on the present occasion we are prepared to grant all, or nearly all, he asks.<lb/>
I am afraid I cannot quite agree with what the noble Lord said as to the regulations with regard to officers' certificates, and even at the expense of keeping your
<col>638</col>
Lordships for a few minutes I should like to run over what they are. For the purpose of determining what certificates are required British ships are divided into, three classes. There are, first, foreign-going ships sailing from the United Kingdom, and in this class are included home trade passenger ships. I ought to explain that the home trade includes all ships trading, between ports in the United Kingdom and also with certain Continental ports situated between the River Elbe and the Port of Brest. In the second class we have the home trade cargo ships, and in the third class British ships trading wholly abroad. The provisions with regard to the officers who must be carried apply only to the first of these classes. Those regulations are broadly these&#x2014;that every British foreign-going ship and every other passenger ship must carry a duly certificated master and must also carry at least one other officer holding a mate's certificate, except in the case of certain small sailing ships. But there is a further provision. which extends that rule considerably, and that is that where, as a matter of fact, two mates are carried, one of those must have a first mate's certificate and the other must have a second mate's certificate at least. There are further regulations to which the noble Lord has not alluded which apply to engineers. Every foreign going steamship of 100 horse-power and. upwards must carry two engineers, one with a first-class and the other with at least a second-class certificate, and if of less than 100 horsepower it need only carry one engineer with a second-class certificate. Those are the regulations, and what I have to say with regard to them is that, in the opinion of the Board of Trade, regarded as a minimum&#x2014;and your Lordships must remember that these are minimum regulations&#x2014;they are sufficient, and it is thought at the Board of Trade that, considering the enormous amount of shipping which goes in and' out of our ports, the wreck returns and, other information available do not show that our ships are insufficiently officered.<lb/>
The second class are the home trade cargo ships. With regard to this class I agree with the noble Lord that at present there are no requirements as to certificates of officers, but, as I have already stated, my right bon. friend does propose&#x2014;he hopes this session&#x2014;to introduce legislation dealing with that subject. And I may say
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0345"/>
<col>639</col>
that it is largely done for one of the reasons given by the noble Lord&#x2014;that at present there are no means of dealing with these officers, because they have no certificates which can be forfeited in cases of misconduct and carelessness. I would also like to say of the men who carry on that trade that they are a fine body of men, and I do not wish to say anything in any way disparaging about them, because their trade, which is carried on in narrow waters very full of ships, has been carried on with extraordinarily few accidents. I would also observe that the men who are at present carrying on this trade will not suffer in any way, because we propose that they shall be given certificates of service to which they will be entitled by reason of the time that they have carried on the trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01390"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: I take it that if a man's certificate of service is suspended through any fault of his own, it will be understood that he will not be allowed to command during the period of suspension.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01391"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will not expect me at this stage to give details of the legislation which it is proposed to introduce. The third class consists of British ships which trade wholly abroad. There are, of course, difficulties in making regulations for them, because it is extremely difficult to enforce any regulations you may make, but I may say that my right hon. friend is considering that question as well, though I do not definitely promise any legislation regarding it.<lb/>
The second part of the noble Lord's Question deals with the recommendations of the Manning Committee. There are two principal recommendations, as far as I can make out, which are applicable&#x2014;No. 31, which suggests certain detailed requirements with regard to the certificates of officers engaged in the foreign trade; and No. 32, which suggests legislation with regard to the home trade. As to the first of those recommendations, I have already said that in the opinion of the Board of Trade those requirements are not necessary, and with regard to the second, it is, as I have said, proposed to carry that out. As to the Return for which the noble Lord asks, we are quite willing to give it to him, and the only suggestion I would make is that he should consult with me as to its exact form with the object of limiting its size.</membercontribution></p>
<col>640</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01392"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has made a very kind reply in answer to the Motion of my noble friend behind me. But I am not sure that the noble Lord realises what a service my noble friend has rendered to the country and to the merchant service by pressing this matter upon your Lordships' House and upon the country for so many years, and, may I add, for so many years in vain. My noble friend began to agitate in this matter some eight or nine years ago, and it is only now that His Majesty's Government are able to say that they hope&#x2014;the noble Lord opposite was characteristically cautious&#x2014;that they hope to introduce legislation on this subject in the present session. I confess I do not understand why there should be any doubt. Where does the difficulty lie? Does the noble Lord think he will be opposed in your Lordships' House if he tries to legislate in a matter of this kind? Does he anticipate in another place there may be opportunities for delay of which advantage will be taken when the interests of those engaged in the merchant service are at stake I can assure the noble Lord that he is quite mistaken if he thinks that there will be any difficulty in passing legislation of this kind if it is really called for.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01393"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the noble Marquess? I do not anticipate any delay. I believe that the legislation will be introduced this session, but the noble Marquess himself must understand that there has been difficulty in the past. The Manning Committee reported in 1896, but no President of the Board of Trade, not excluding the noble Marquess himself, has seen his way to introduce legislation up to this date.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01394"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I think my noble friend has indulged in what we used to call in my early days a <i>tu quoque</i>, but I cannot charge my memory with its having been brought to my notice when I was at the Board of Trade. The broad fact remains that this matter is at present under the notice of the Board of Trade, and my noble friend behind me is justified in his complaint. Therefore I should have expected an absolutely confident promise that legislation would be introduced, rather than the cautious hope that it would be introduced this session. However, that may be a form of words
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0346"/>
<col>641</col>
equivalent to the same thing. If legislation is not introduced I hope that my noble friend behind me wilt return to the charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01395"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: The Bill is drafted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01396"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I apologise for having criticised the noble Lord's phraseology. The Bill is drafted, and no doubt will be introduced forthwith. Just let me say one word upon the remarks of the noble Lord opposite. He declined to go into the details of the Bill. Of course, he is perfectly right. If the Bill is yet to be introduced it would be out of place to discuss the details. But I am rather concerned with the interruption my noble friend made in the noble Lord's speech&#x2014;that if certificates of service are to be granted to those at present engaged in commanding ships, they should be liable to the same accidents which at present fall to the certificates of certificated officers&#x2014;namely, that they can be suspended or removed altogether in case of misconduct. That seems to follow as a matter of course, and without that the certificates cannot be of much use. I noticed that the noble Lord made a marked distinction between cargo ships engaged in the home trade and ships engaged entirely in the foreign trade, and that whereas he confidently hoped that this Bill, which is already drafted, would be introduced with regard to the home trade, he was unable to give any promise with regard to ships engaged in the foreign trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01397"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: Those are ships which trade wholly abroad, and never conic home.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01398"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend was referring to the trade represented by a very large number of ships which never come home but which carry on trade between foreign ports. He said he was not sure that he could introduce legislation with regard to them because of the difficulty in enforcing it. That is a matter I should hardly like to go into now; but I should have thought that there was full opportunity of exercising such an authority over these ships as would be sufficiently effective to force them to carry out such regulations as to carrying certificated officers as Parliament and the Board of Trade might see fit to impose.
<col>642</col>
I know that these ships navigate the seas under a very strict code of regulations made by this Parliament, and therefore I do not see why in this matter they should not be subject to the same rules as those ships which are engaged in the home cargo trade. However, I do not want to press the noble Lord upon the point at this moment. He is fully entitled to reserve to himself the right to go into the details at a later stage. I will content myself on that head with merely asking the noble Lord and the right hon. gentleman the President of the Board of Trade to consider whether they cannot extend the same provisions as to enforcing certificates to ships trading between foreign ports as they propose to enforce with regard to the home trade. I do not think it is desirable to trouble your Lordships further. I wish to thank the noble Lord opposite for his promise, and to congratulate most heartily my noble friend Lord Muskerry on the success of his efforts.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANTS BILL.<lb/> [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01401" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01402">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01403"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CHICHESTER</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will no doubt remember that a Bill to set up a register for England and Wales was introduced into this House two Parliaments ago. That Bill met with considerable opposition from Scottish and Irish Peers, who feared that the Scottish and Irish accountants might meet with some disabilities under it. I need not further refer to that opposition, because it has been met by the setting up of three different registers and by Clause 22. But other objections were raised. The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, raised certain objections, and as those objections apply as much to this Bill as to the last I will address myself to answering them. The noble Marquess said, in effect, that when introducing a Bill of this sort one ought to prove, first, that there was an evil, and then that
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0347"/>
<col>643</col>
the Bill went some way to remedying that evil. I am afraid he added that I had not done so. I hope the noble Marquess will blame me, and not my cause. But before I proceed to answer him, I think I should remind your Lordships of the present state of the profession of accountants, and what they are expected to do.<lb/>
There are in Scotland three great societies of considerable age, and I think I am right in saying that they include almost every practising accountant in Scotland. The society in Glasgow received its Charter in 1855, the one in Edinburgh in 1854, and that in Aberdeen in 867. With regard to Ireland, there is one society, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland. This society was given its Charter in the year 1888, and I think I may say that practically all practising accountants in Ireland belong to it. In England, the position is somewhat different. There are two great societies. There is the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1880. And then there is the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors, which was incorporated in 1885 under Section 23 of the Companies Act, 1867. They were then allowed by the Board of Trade to dispense with the use of the word"Limited."These two great societies exercise, as do the Scottish and Irish Societies, considerable control over their members, and ensure, as far as they can, that their members should be efficient and practical, first by examination and then by a long course of apprenticeship. They also ensure a high standard of integrity through their disciplinary committees.<lb/>
There are also in England certain unattached accountants who belong to no societies, and who, not having undergone the terrors of an examination, give no guarantee of efficiency. Their ranks have been and may at any time be added to by accountants who, for some unprofessional conduct, have had to leave the society to which they belonged. Besides these unattached accountants certain limited liability companies have recently sprung up. I have no doubt most of your Lordships have had communications from one or other of them. I shall have something more to say about them afterwards, but I may say here that the view that the profession take of them is that in a great many cases the members of these societies
<col>644</col>
are in no way accountants at all, and would not so define themselves. They are bookkeepers, most estimable people, but they have not the knowledge to practise, and I do not know that they even want to.<lb/>
What are the duties that accountants are called upon to perform? I think the most important duties are these: (1) auditors of public companies; (2) trustees in bankruptcy; and (3) liquidators of insolvent companies. Those are the three businesses that public accountants are called upon and ought to be ready to perform. With regard to the accounts of public companies, these men have to deal with incomes that amount to millions and to consider the interests of shareholders in the case of hundreds of thousands. Their labours have not been lightened by recent legislation. On the contrary their duties are more responsible now than they ever were before. I believe a recent judgment has laid down that it is not enough for an auditor to prove that the balance sheet of a company is rightly and truly drawn according to the books of the company&#x2014;he has to go beyond that and to himself make sure that the books themselves are likely to give the right position of that company. And it has been laid down that unless he does so his audit is a farce. Then with regard to trustees in bankruptcy. This is au important point with regard to this Bill, because it is, I think, more as trustees in bankruptcy that inefficient men&#x2014;and I am hound to say in some cases men who have betrayed their trust&#x2014;have been appointed. And when you consider that trustees in bankruptcy have annually to deal with sums amounting to &#x00A3;5,000,000, you will see that this is a very serious thing in the public interest. I shall have later on to quote some cases from Parliamentary Papers and from the official reports which the Examiner in Bankruptcy has made, and in which he says that these cases are becoming much too numerous.<lb/>
When the previous Bill was introduced the attitude of the Board of Trade was described by one noble Lord as"cool but correct."The other day I read my noble friend's speech again, and I need hardly say it was perfectly correct, but I cannot describe it as cool. However, I think I am entitled from what he said then to draw these conclusions&#x2014;he will correct me if I
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0348"/>
<col>645</col>
am wrong&#x2014;that the Board of Trade do approve of the principle of this Bill, that they do not see anything in the way that it is drafted to disapprove of, but that they hold to themselves the right to propose Amendments in Committee. I hope I am not going too far, but that is what I read into my noble friend's words. I must say that I shall be very much surprised if the Board of Trade did not look benevolently on this Bill. Because what is their position? Auditors of public accounts, trustees in bankruptcy, and liquidators of insolvent companies all have to file their accounts with different officials of the Board of Trade, and it is rather anomalous for these accounts to be so filed when there is no definition of what a public accountant is, and no guarantee that the man who has certified these accounts is efficient, or even honest.<lb/>
Let me support my case not from <i>ex parte</i> statements but from official Reports which are also Parliamentary Papers. First, the Home Office Report of 1896 dealing with criminal statistics found it necessary to explain away the high percentage of crime amongst so-called accountants by the statement that betting agents and similar persons are in the habit of so describing themselves when they come within the meshes of the law. The Reports of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy may also he cited as evidence of the difficulties experienced at present in dealing with unqualified and dishonourable accountants. On page 14 of Report No. 17 for the year 1899 the Inspector-General says&#x2014;
<quote>"The extent to which deeds of arrangement are executed and carried through without any reference to the wishes of creditors is becoming serious. This system is much facilitated by the methods of certain accountants, not belonging to any of the recognised professional bodies, who carry on an advertising and touting business under the cloak of seine high-sounding name of an association for the guardianship or protection of trade."</quote>
Then on page 12 he states&#x2014;
<quote>"There are numerous instances in which trustees after realising assets have absconded&#x2026;Persons entirely without means and of indifferent character frequently obtain trusteeships. Bankruptcy does not disqualify a trustee from acting under a deed, and instances occur in which the person appointed is either an undischarged bankrupt or becomes bankrupt or executes an assignment while continuing to act as trustee. The Department is put to great trouble and expense in obtaining accounts from such impecunious trustees, and when an order is obtained against them they are unable to pay the costs."</quote>
<col>646</col>
Further, on page 13 the Inspector-General says&#x2014;
<quote>"In July last a creditor under a deed complained that he could get no dividend, although the trustee had sold the estate and received the proceeds in February&#x2026;ticular accountant has had thirteen cases since December, 1897, only one of which has been wound up. In three of them complaints have been received as to his dealings with the estate or as to non-payment of dividend, and in several the trustee is in default as to his accounts."</quote>
On page 24 of Report No. 20 for 1902 particulars are given of the case of a bankrupt whose real and only business, although he styled himself an accountant, consisted of acquiring options for the purpose of gold mines and other properties. Then there is the case of a man who, though he was excluded from membership of the Society of Incorporated Accountants in 1903 for failure to distribute trust monies left in his hands, subsequently continued to practise as an accountant and was elected trustee of a bankrupt's estate in 1905. The Board of Trade refused to certify the trusteeship on information supplied by the society.<lb/>
May I trouble your Lordships with just one other quotation' It is from Report No. 22 for the year 1904&#x2014;
<quote>"Prosecution and conviction of a fraudulent trustee.&#x2014;This trustee had been an undischarged bankrupt since July, 1000, but had, notwithstanding, succeeded in securing trusteeships under twenty-two deeds of arrangement by using the names of other persons &#x2026;n one case no accounts have yet been obtained. The imprisonment of this practitioner has for the time being checked his activities, but there is apparently nothing to prevent him from acquiring trustee ships under deeds as previously when he is released"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, unless your Lordships pass this Bill.<lb/>
I will ask your Lordships to look at the Bill for one moment and allow me to explain three or four of the clauses. Only a very few of the clauses need any explanation. Clauses 7, 8 and 9 give in triplicate the list of persons who can claim as a right to be registered. Those who can claim registration are all present and future members of the Institutes and Societies mentioned in the Bill, and the members of certain Colonial institutes or societies who give notice of their intention to practise in any part of the United Kingdom, and all persons who, though not members of any of the said institutes or societies, were in practice in any part of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0349"/>
<col>647</col>
the United Kingdom at the passing of the Bill. Persons not being entitled as aforesaid but who were articled before the passing of the Bill and who pass the prescribed examinations will also be entitled to be registered. Clause 12 allows appeal by either of the three Committees to the Privy Council in cases where it is thought that the standard of proficiency, required at the examination of any of the great societies falls below the proper standard. Clauses 13 and 15 give power to refuse registration in certain cases, and power to remove a name from a register; but a right of appeal against such decision is permitted under Clause 17&#x2014;to the High Court in England or Ireland, or to the Court of Session in Scotland, as the case may be.<lb/>
Clause 22 is, perhaps, the most important in the Bill. It prohibits, under a penalty, the use by an unregistered person of the title of professional accountant, etc. The clause further permits an accountant on the register of one of the three countries to go on his client's business&#x2014;to conduct audits and so on&#x2014;in the other two countries without registration there, provided he has no place of business in those countries. I might mention that similar Bills to this have been passed in the Transvaal, in New Zealand, and quite lately in Natal, and that the societies which have come <i>ipso facto</i> on to the registers in those Colonies are also parties to this Bill.<lb/>
Now, I come to the opposition&#x2014;I hope of a very limited character&#x2014;that this Bill will have to meet. That opposition comes from certain self-constituted societies which think they have a right to be on the register <i>ipso facto</i>, and <i>en bloc</i>. I think it is easier for me to put our case in the words of the President of one of, perhaps, the most active of these societies which desire to be on the register. I will not mention names. Two sentences from his speech describe better than I can myself the feelings that we have on the matter. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The membership of our Association is now 1,102; that is, at November 30 last. May I just show you how we have gradually grown. At the end of our first year&#x2014;1905&#x2014;we had 314 members; the next year we had 653; it has gradually gone up&#x2014;without burdening you with figures&#x2014;till in 1909 we had 746, and now we have 1,102, an increase of 350 members in one year&#x2026;I am pleased to say that during the past year we have had 23 candidates sitting for examination, 12 in the month of June and 11 just the other day."</quote>
<col>648</col>
Later on, in dealing with the accounts, the President said&#x2014;
<quote>"You will note the item,' Special issue of Journal and Objects, &#x00A3;276 18<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.,' but on the other side yon will find that the entrance fees were &#x00A3;439, so that you see we spent. &#x00A3;276 to get &#x00A3;440, and I think that shows that the money has been well spent, the result being that our membership has jumped up from about 746 to 1,102."</quote>
That so clearly sets out the objects and aims of one of these societies who desire to be registered that I do not think I need give the reasons why we trust they will not be so included. I do not know whether that was a post-prandial oration, but your Lordships will probably say <i>in vino veritas</i>. I do not think I need further comment on that. But we do feel that some of these bodies may have a case, and that individuals may possibly have a case to put before the Committee to which your Lordships send this Bill. We are extremely anxious that no injustice should be done, and, therefore, if you grant this Bill a Second Reading, I shall move that it he sent to a Joint Committee of both Houses, in order that these associations or individuals may state their case, and that their arguments may be weighed and considered.<lb/>
I do not wish in any way to minimise the importance of what we seek. We are asking for statutory powers in order that the discipline and control exercised by these great societies may be made effective, and, bearing in mind that recent legislation has given new responsibilities to the profession of accountants, I do not think it is too much to ask that these accountants should be enabled to raise their profession, to set their house in order, and thus give a guarantee of high efficiency and integrity throughout the whole profession. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

I myself criticised certain of its provisions, and pointed out that the position of Ireland had been entirely ignored. I am glad to see that that omission has now been rectified. Other objections were
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0350"/>
<col>649</col>
raised to the Bill, sonic of which have been removed and some of which still remain. Upon them I offer no opinion now, but I can readily see that when the Bill goes into Committee Clause 22, which was objected to before, will be again criticised and closely examined. I am glad to know that it is intended to keep an open mind in reference to such arguments as may be addressed on Amendments in the Committee stage. Just before the sitting of the House, I was handed a statement of four pages dealing in detail with the Bill, and discussing it apparently with considerable knowledge. I shall myself keep an open mind on that memorandum. If have only had time to read it hastily, but from what I can gather there are a good many people who would like to see the Bill considered from an amending point of view. Therefore I am satisfied that it will be necessary when the Committee stage of this Bill is reached to be prepared to listen to some arguments that will be addressed in reference to the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01406"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships and the Government will give a favourable consideration to this Bill, because it has frequently come before me in the last eight or nine years that there is a necessity for preventing the use of the word"accountant"in many cases. I have known eases where people have used the term"accountant"to cover all sorts of objectionable businesses, and I sincerely hope that steps will be taken to strengthen the Bill with a view to preventing that. I see that the Bill contemplates permitting persons who are now accountants to be registered. That has been done already with regard to surveyors and engineers, and you can only introduce examinations by steps. I am glad to know that there is an idea of stiffening the examinations, and I hope that the dame which enables the authorities to reject people who are not worthy to be members will be carefully and strictly worked. The present law wants strengthening, because at present the term"accountant"is used to attract people, whereas those using it have no qualifications for it, and are not really carrying on the business of accountants at all. I will not describe some of the businesses now using that title, but they are certainly not callings which your Lordships would wish to encourage under that name. All I desire to see in reference
<col>650</col>
to Clause 22 is that chartered accountants and professional accountants are described by a name which is not to be taken by other people in future. I am satisfied that this Bill will require amendment in Committee, but I think it is a most desirable Bill, and I hope the Government will favourably consider it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01407"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I was one of those who criticised the Bill on this subject some two years ago, I may say I did so because I thought that Scottish accountants should have equal facilities with English accountants, and in my opinion they did not get them under that Bill. It was then my opinion that the Bill could not be altered in Committee to meet these objections, and I congratulate the noble Earl opposite on the result of what has taken place since. This Bill is a far better Bill, as I am sure your Lordships will agree. I shall be very glad to withdraw the whole of ray objections to the Bill, although certain Amendments can be made, and to very heartily support the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01408"><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would like to say one word on behalf of the London Chamber of Commerce, who are very anxious that your Lordships should give this Bill a Second Reading on this occasion. It is supported by two bodies which are closely associated with the Chamber, and which now comprise 7,784 members, every one of whom is in favour of the principle of this Bill. The business men who are represented in the Chamber of Commerce are very anxious that there should be a definite register of accountants by Statute in the interests, not only of the accountants themselves, but also of the general public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01409"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think anybody will be surprised, after the very undecided answer my noble friend received when he introduced his Bill the year before last, that he has come forward with another Bill on the same subject. On that occasion, out of the twenty-eight noble Lords who remained in the House fourteen voted for the Second Reading and fourteen voted against it. The noble Lords who comprised that small band will perhaps remember&#x2014;my noble friend behind me has referred to it this evening&#x2014;that the attitude of the Government towards the Bill was described by a noble Lord as being"cool but correct."
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0351"/>
<col>651</col>
That was a very accurate description at the time, and rather appropriate in view of the international character which the dispute had assumed. But now when my noble friend is, I believe, able to come here and tell us that not only has he removed the opposition of the Scottish and Irish accountants but has actually enlisted their support, I think I may say that the attitude of the Government, while still, I hope, correct, is appreciably warmer and more cordial than it was on that occasion. What the Government hope you will do&#x2014;and it is the same advice that we gave before&#x2014;is this, that you will accord the Bill a Second Reading and then agree to the further Motion to refer the Bill to a Joint Committee of both Houses, in order that those who, rightly or wrongly, consider that they have a grievance under the Bill as it stands may have ample opportunity of being heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01410"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: As your Lordships have been informed, there is no desire on this side of the House to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. The noble Earl who introduced it referred to me personally, and perhaps I may be permitted to say that the reason why I ventured not to agree with him on the last occasion was that it appeared to me that in the case of the introduction of restrictive legislation an ample case ought to be made out. There are a great number of bodies of persons engaged in different pursuits, and sometimes it is proper to have their professions or trades made into a close profession or trade; but sometimes it is not proper. It depends on the circumstances of the case. Prima facie every subject of His Majesty has a right to call himself anything he pleases, and to trade in any way he pleases, so long as what he does is legal. If you call upon him to refrain from describing himself in a particular way, you have to show some reason for that restriction. The noble Earl gave himself a great deal of trouble, which I cordially appreciate, in his speech this
<col>652</col>
afternoon to show why he thought in this particular instance of accountants such restrictive legislation was necessary in the interests of the public, in order that the public should not be deceived when they see the term "accountant" or "public accountant" inscribed over the door of a particular professional man. I think <i>prima facie</i> the noble Earl has made out his case this evening, and I am pleased to be able to reckon myself as one of the supporters of the Second Reading of the Bill. As to the actual details, it is necessary that they should be carefully scrutinised lest the particular standard which is set up should not be appropriate and should be not fairly drawn, and also to secure that those who administer it should not exclude such rules as would enlist the confidence of the profession and of the public. But that is a matter for Committee, and I am delighted to hear that this subject is to be carefully scrutinised by a Joint Committee of both Houses. I do not think the noble Earl could have taken a better course, and I think he is entitled to the thanks of your Lordships' House for the way in which he has submitted this particular measure.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE PREROGATIVE OF THE CROWN,</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01442"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the noble Viscount who leads the House whether he is able to give us any information as to the views of His Majesty's Government with regard to the date of the Easter holiday, and perhaps as to its duration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01443"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid I must answer the noble Marquess's question by asking him to be so kind as to give us information as to the date on which he thinks it likely he might be able to bring before the House the proposals for its reconstitution, of which he has given notice. As soon as he tells me that, I will tell him what we propose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01444"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think the question which the noble Viscount has asked me is an unreasonable one, and I will answer it. If I am to assume, what I think I am right in assuming after a conversation with the noble Viscount, that the Easter adjournment might begin on some day during next week, I am afraid I see no prospect of being able to introduce the Bill for the reconstitution of this House before the Easter holiday. It is a personal disappointment to me to make that announcement, but I hope that the postponement may not occasion too much inconvenience to your Lordships. But, my Lords, there is one preliminary step connected with the Bill in question which we should be glad to see taken before we adjourn. The
<col>656</col>
Bill, like any Bill dealing with the constitution of this House, necessarily touches the Royal Prerogative. The result of inquiries which I have made has been to satisfy me that any Bill of which that can be said ought not to be introduced into either House of Parliament without the previous sanction of the Crown. I will not at this moment attempt to discuss the precedents by which we have been led to this conclusion, but we are satisfied that it is in accordance with the practice of Parliament and with the respect which we owe to the Crown that that preliminary concurrence should be obtained. In these circumstances I should like on Thursday next to make the following Motion&#x2014;
<quote>"That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying His Majesty that, with a view to the Reform of the present Constitution of the House of Lords, His Majesty would be graciously pleased to consent to a Bill being introduced limiting the Prerogative and Powers of the Crown in so far as they relate to the creation of Peerages and to the issue of Writs of Summons to Lords Spiritual and Temporal to attend and sit and vote in the House of Lords."</quote>
I suggested just now that I should move that Address on Thursday next. I have chosen that day for the reason that, acting upon advice of a professional rather than a political character, I shall be obliged to absent myself from this House next week. Thursday is, therefore, the last available day so far as I am concerned. But, my Lords, I readily admit that, considering the importance of the matter, the notice which I have given is brief If the noble Viscount thinks it too short I am in his hands, and the Motion will either be made by some one else in my place at a later date, or else postponed until after the Easter holiday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01445"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we are all cordially sorry that professional reasons should actuate the noble Marquess in any step he has to take. No doubt we might have complained that the notice that he has now given is rather short, but I think I may say that I shall be prepared on Thursday, having examined the precedents in the meantime, to state what the view of His Majesty's Government as to the Motion of the noble Marquess is. Then with regard to the Easter recess, as the noble Marquess's Bill is not to be brought forward before Easter I think it would be convenient if we adjourned from April 6 until April 26. If the House approves, that will be our proposal.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REPERENCE TO THE PEOPLE BILL, [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01446" align="center">[SECOND READING]</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01447">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01448"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGIT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to move the Second Reading of this Bill I am sure I shall carry all your Lordships with me when I say that we profoundly- regret the absence of the Leader of the Government, who took a prominent part in the discussion upon the First Reading of the Bill. I should like to add that in venturing to fix to-day for the Second Reading of the Bill, which I did nearly a month ago, I hoped that by this time we should have been able to have seen the proposals which affect the reconstitution of this House, and that, perhaps, it would have been easier to discuss the provisions in the Bill the Second Reading of which I am about to move if we had seen those proposals. But through circumstances of which we are aware, and which we all regret, it has not been possible for the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House to be with us during the whole of the last few weeks, and to have brought forward his Bill. I had to consider the question whether I would ask the leave of the House to postpone the Second Reading of my Bill or bring it on, and upon the whole I thought that probably, the date having been fixed for some time, it would be less inconvenient to your Lordships that the debate should take place to-day as arranged. So far as any future stages of the Bill are concerned, should your Lordships be good enough to give it a Second Reading, I shall take good care not to unduly press the matter to the inconvenience of any section of the House. I hope that on this stage of the Bill we may have a useful discussion of what, after all, as it seems to me, is one of the most important subjects on which this House could engage its attention.<lb/>
I said so much on the First Reading of the Bill that I hope not to detain your Lordships for very long at the present time, and in what I do say I shall endeavour to confine my attention mainly to answering some of the objections which I have seen brought forward to the proposals contained in the Bill. In the first place, the Bill is said by some to amount to so great a change that in their opinion it is an even
<col>658</col>
greater revolution than that which is proposed by the Parliament Bill. I cannot share that opinion. I not only cannot share that opinion, but I cannot see any ground upon which it can be seriously put forward. Really, if I may venture to say so, the object which my Bill would effect is to restore the very idea of our Constitution, that the people should govern. Under the constitution of Parliament the assent of three different interests is required for the passage of any Bill&#x2014;His Majesty the King, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the other House of Parliament. No two of them up to the present time have been able to act without the concurrence of the third. But the Government Bill, which I am not going to discuss&#x2014;I merely state the fact&#x2014;not only, as it seems to me, entirely takes away the concurrence of your Lordships' House from any legislation in the sense that it renders it un- necessary, but if I am right in stating that: the modern theory is that the Sovereign is to act upon the advice of the Ministry of the day, it would amount not only to the supersession of one branch of the Legislature, but would put actually supreme and the possibility of tyrannical power into the hands of one of the three constituent parts of Parliament. Surely if I am right in that, that is a much greater revolution than anything which is contained in the, comparatively speaking, humble Bill which I have put on your Lordships' Table.<lb/>
The conditions under which my Bill proposes that the reference to the people should take effect are two-fold. They will be found in the first two clauses of the Bill. In the first clause there is a provision made for reference to the people in the case of difference of opinion between the Houses of Parliament, and that throughout my-Bill is described as the case of a rejected. Bill. In the second clause there is a certain provision for a reference to the people in the case of what is described as a carried Bill. In the first of these two clauses it is provided that the Bill which is to be referred to the people in the event of a difference of opinion between the Houses of Parliament is the Bill in its terms as it leaves the other House of Parliament. Some criticisms have been made upon that proposal, and it has been suggested that there should be alternatives in the schedule providing for a more or less complicated series of questions being, put to the electorate as to whether the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0355"/>
<col>659</col>
people would prefer the Bill in this form or that form, or with or without the Amendments agreed to by one or other of the Houses of Parliament. I deliberately chose to suggest to the House that it should be the Bill as it leaves the other House of Parliament, for two reasons. In the first place, that House is much more largely the House for the initiation of legislation, and therefore it seems to me more natural that if there is a difference of opinion it should be the Bill as it leaves the popular House which should be referred to the people.<lb/>
But, my Lords, there is another reason. I believe that this provision would have a powerful effect, not only upon Governments, but upon some of their extreme partisans in another place to be careful as to the form in which they send a Bill up to this House. I do not know whether any of your Lordships will share my view, but I have sometimes thought that some of the differences of opinion which have emerged between the two Houses of Parliament have been made more acute, I hardly like to say purposely, by some desire to cultivate popularity with the extremer partisans in the other House of Parliament for the sake of the Government being able to say in the other House, "Oh, we have done what we can to meet your views," and then when the House of Lords rejects the Bill to take credit for having endeavoured to please their supporters and being prevented from carrying their wishes into effect by the House of Lords, which is thereupon the subject of condemnation. Now, if the Bill as referred to the people is the Bill as it leaves the House of Commons, that would obviously put a great premium upon moderation in the form of the proposals which are brought up here, because the more reasonable they are in most cases I venture to believe the greater success they would have should they be referred to the people.<lb/>
Another criticism which has been made upon this clause, and by a personal friend of my own, is that it is unfair to this House that Bills which originate here should not be also made the subject of reference to the people. If your Lordships look at the drafting of the clause you will see that that is not possible under the clause as now drafted. To a certain extent there is a theoretical inequality in that provision. In theory, beyond all question the Houses
<col>660</col>
of Parliament, except on matters of finance, are co-ordinate in jurisdiction. There is no restriction as to Bills which may originate either in one House of Parliament or the other. As I have said, beyond all question a. very much greater number of Bills do originate in the other House, and I think your Lordships will see that, though it might be a counsel of perfection, it is impossible as a matter of practical politics that Bills which originate in this House during the spring months of the year, when we are at any rate not overburdened with work, should compulsorily, should they not be passed by the other House of Parliament, be made the subject of a reference to the people. As a matter of practical politics, and, as I venture to think, of sound consideration, I have thought it better to suggest that only Bills initiated in the other House of Parliament should be the subject of a reference to the people should disagreement between the Houses emerge in connection with them.<lb/>
With regard to the second clause, the proposal is made that should both Houses carry a Bill it should be still possible for 200 Members of the House of Commons to ask for a reference to the people. In the first place I wish to say that the number of 200 is a purely arbitrary selection. Some suggestions have been made that it would be better to have a certain definite proportion of what is described as the regular Opposition, but under some circumstances&#x2014;perhaps under present circumstances&#x2014;it would be rather difficult to define what is the regular Opposition, and we would have, perhaps, to have statistics as to those gentlemen in the other House of Parliament who receive regularly the summonses to attend from one or other of the offices. I do not adhere to the idea of 200. It may be 150 or 250 for any matter of principle but I venture to select 200 as illustrating what I mean. At any rate the getting of 200 Members of the other House of Parliament to ask for a reference to the people would go far to show that there was a substantial desire to have the judgment of the electorate upon any proposal. I should have thought it was sufficiently obvious that the idea underlying this provision was an effort to be fair as between the two great political Parties, but by a curious perversity I have been charged in one quarter that I noticed with an extraordinarily cute design to
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0356"/>
<col>661</col>
provide for such a case as this, that when this House had accepted a Bill proposed by a Liberal Government, even then the Conservative minority in the other House should suggest a reference to the people. I had no such deep design in my mind. It. was an honest effort to meet the common complaint&#x2014;not, I ant bound to say, an unreasonable complaint&#x2014;-made by members of the Party opposite, that when the Conservative Party are in power they have command in both Houses of Parliament and we live under what is called single-Chamber government. The sole idea that I had in proposing this second clause was to endeavour to be perfectly fair as between the two Parties, and to provide a means whereby, if a Radical or Liberal Opposition in the other House of Parliament desired to take the judgment of the people on a Bill which had been accepted by both Houses of Parliament, the machinery to do so should be open.<lb/>
It is a commonplace. I think, although not always recognised, that if, as I hope, we are to have two Houses of Parliament, the Second House as it is called must always be more or less Conservative in character. None of us desire that it should be strong enough to be really obstructive, but what we do desire is that it should be independent enough to make sure that the people are not taken by surprise, and that they are really masters in their own house. In other words, if I may venture to say so, we agree to predominance, but we do not agree to supremacy which is uncontrolled even for a little time. It is sometimes said by other objectors to the Bill that this provision by which 200 Members of the other Rouse of Parliament can have a reference in the case of a carried Bill would lead to too many applications of the provision, so many, indeed, as to interfere seriously with the business of the country and be a nuisance to everybody concerned. It is difficult to be sure on any point of the kind. I may make the continent that that, at any rate, is prophesied. Even if the prophecy came true for a time. I believe the mere fact of its doing so would work its own cure, and that the unpopularity of the course would be so great that the 200 Members would hesitate to put it too often to the test.<lb/>
What is the alternative to some proposal of this kind? The alternative must lie in the making of a schedule or a list of

classes of measures which are to be the subject of the reference. Sonic have suggested limiting Bills which are to be the subject of reference to those which propose some great Constitutional change, to those which interfere with Treaties of Union between the different component parts of the United Kingdom. Each of these suggestions has something to be said for it. It is a very taking idea that any Bill which proposes to interfere with the Treaties of Union should be the subject of reference, and not only of reference to the United Kingdom as a whole, but of reference separately to each of the country which have been bound together by Union. But when you come to look into it you find that the provisions, for example in the Treaty of Union between England and Scotland are so diverse in their range that it is not altogether easy to settle what is and what is not an essential or fundamental part of the Treaty of Union. The Treaty of Union between England and Scotland, while it takes care of the establishment of the Churches on both sides of the Tweed, also provides for such a relatively small matter as the number of a certain class of officials who are to be employed in the Court of Session. It is not very wise to say that any Bill which proposed to interfere with a matter comparatively trivial such as that should necessarily be made a subject of reference to the people, but unless you can find some distinct line on one side or the other on which all measures will lie you will have to set up some sort of tribunal to decide whether a Bill does or does not come within the category. I frankly say that this is a matter which I think is fraught with the greatest possible difficulty. There will be a suspicion, perhaps a not altogether unreasonable suspicion, of a purely legal tribunal in this respect&#x2014;that it would, perhaps, impinge upon the supremacy of Parliament and any matter which is not to be decided upon pure principles of law will certainly come across lines of general policy, and no tribunal sufficiently impartial can, in my opinion, be devised.<lb/>
I am hound to admit&#x2014;I think it best frankly to do so&#x2014;that if we reach the Committee stage there would have to be something put into one of the clauses of the Bill to prevent the reference of ordinary Finance Bills to the electorate. They would have, of course, to be defined, and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0357"/>
<col>663</col>
probably that would not be so difficult a task as separating between different classes of other kinds of legislation. I frankly admit that it would be absolutely impossible to conceive the idea of giving power to the minority in the other House of Parliament to refer the ordinary Aids of Supply Bills which come up each year. Another objection taken to this second clause is that the provision allowing 200 Members of the other House of Parliament to get a reference to the people would interrupt, as it was said, the strongest Government at its work. Just consider what this objection means. Either a Bill is in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people or it is not. If the Bill referred to them is accepted by the people, I venture to say that the Government would gain greatly in dignity, and the Bill would get a great deal more support behind it than it would otherwise have and if the Bill is rejected, surely the idea that it would interrupt the Government in its work is rather an advantage than a disadvantage, because if the majority of the people do not want the Bill why should the Government and the dominant Party force it upon them?<lb/>
My Lords, what is the object we all have in view&#x2014;the object which at any rate we all of us profess, and I believe honestly, to have in view? It is that in matters of legislation the settled will of the people shall prevail. They are to be, in other words, the arbiters of their own destiny. That is the object and the justification of the whole of our representative system. But I ask your Lordships, Is there any one who can say that we do get that now, and that we are getting it with an increasing degree of certainty? My wish and my hope is that if any proposal upon the lines of this Bill is put into the Constitution it will make it more certain than it has ever been in the past that no legislation of a serious nature can be carried unless it has the support of the majority of the people behind it. We want to pass the legislation that the people desire and to reject that which they do not desire. I ask any of your Lordships how can we better ascertain where the dividing line between these two classes of Bills lies than by asking the people themselves the simple question, "Are you in favour or are you not in favour of this legislative proposal?"<lb/>
<col>664</col>
Some people go so far as to make out that this Bill is an attack upon the representative system. I am afraid that I must endeavour to convict the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack of putting forward this objection. I wish to be perfectly fair to him, and as the quotation is not long I ask your Lordships to allow me to remind you of what the Lord Chancellor said on the occasion of the First Reading of this Bill. The noble and learned Lord said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Referendum would also be fatal to representative government. The political genius of the English people was the first to discover, and after great difficulty to develop, the real basis of liberty and of self-government in this country&#x2014;a system which has been copied all over the world. Every Referendum is an attack on the representative system."</quote>
Again, a few minutes later, the noble and learned Lord said&#x2014;
<quote>"The people&#x2014;should choose men who are honourable, whose judgment may be trusted and with whose opinions they are in harmony. They are sent to Parliament for the purpose of discussing these matters."</quote>
And the noble and learned Lord went on quite candidly to add&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not say that the system at the present time is working altogether satisfactorily."</quote>
I am going to endeavour to show your Lordships that that is a very mild way of putting the difficulties which some of us feel. I ask your Lordships whether you do not agree with me that the necessary conditions for a good, true, and sound representative system are these. In the first place, there must be absolute freedom of choice on the part of those who have to select their representatives. Secondly, there must be no dictation by any central or outside authority, either at the time of the election or subsequently upon the representatives when they are meeting together to discuss the matters that come before them. In other words, after they are once installed in office, the representatives should owe duty only to those who have elected them and whose representatives they are. Let me ask you to consider whether those conditions, to which I am certain every sensible man will agree, are in any way carried out at the present time. Recently I came across an article which was published a year or so ago in a Blackburn paper, written by one of the Members of the other House of Parliament who stands very high for distinctness of opinion and absolute in-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0358"/>
<col>665</col>
dependence of judgment. I refer to Mr. Snowden. In that article&#x2014;it was a written article not a hastily delivered speech Mr. Snowden says&#x2014;
<quote>'The idea that the House of Commons represents the will of the people is a myth. The ordinary member is simply the servant of the Government, and has no control over the Government at all. The Government are the masters. The Government claim to be absolutely the infallible interpreters of the will of the people."</quote>
Then occur these remarkable passages&#x2014;
<quote>"We have not a. democratic Constitution. The people do not rule. The House of Commons does not represent the will of the people. The Government is an autocracy, restrained, just like the Tsar of Russia, by considerations of preservation and their own interests."</quote>
Mr. Snowden goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"It would be an instructive lesson to the electors, who imagined that they were voting for a man to represent their will in Parliament, if they could see that Member coming in from the terrace or the smoking room at the ringing of the Division boll, and at the entrance to the Lobbies having pointed out to him by the Party Whip the particular Lobby into which he must go to register Ins vote for a Motion of which, in nine cases out of ten, he has not the remotest idea lie has not heard a word of the discussion; he does not know even what the question under discussion is he votes as a `supporter of his Party, and if he understands the question and has opinions upon it, it makes no difference. He is there to support his Party, to follow his Leader, to do as be is told. This is expressing the will of the people&#x0021;"</quote>
That is more distinct and more definite than I should have ventured of my own knowledge or in my own words to state. When you contrast that description with the very mild one of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack that the present system does not work "altogether satisfactorily," I venture to say that there is a good deal between them which is worthy of your Lordships' consideration. It is, of course, long since the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack was a private Member. He naturally, therefore, has not the same keen recollection of the conditions as they are said to exist.<lb/>
Just consider for a moment the circumstances under which the last General Election was taken. Can any of us say, will the Government themselves be bold enough to say, that every one of the hundreds of thousands of voters who voted for candidates on their side, is really prepared to support everything which the Government now propose or which they have indicated they are likely to propose in the course of the present Parliament,
<col>666</col>
if those questions were put separately to them? It is commonly said that at any rate on the question of the Parliament Bill the decision was in favour of the policy of the Government. But my point is not met by that. My point can only be met if any one can allege that not only for the Parliament Bill, but for Home Rule, for the disestablishment of the Welsh Church, and for half-a-dozen other things these people would willingly have voted if they were put separately to them. It is said that the proposals in my Bill amount to a great change. I am not prepared to deny that they are a considerable change, but I do press upon your Lordships this consideration, that if this is a great change it is not nearly so great a change as that winch in all probability we may have to discuss in the course of a few weeks. Some things are obvious, but they are not certain always to be acknowledged and to be faced. It is commonly allowed, at any rate by lip-service, that there are to he two Houses of Parliament. I do not desire that the Second House of Parliament should be strong enough permanently to resist what is put before them, provided we can have any assurance that what is so put forward is in accordance with the wish of the people. But what I do say is that, strong or weak, the Second House should be strong enough to ensure appeal in some form or other to the people to make sure that the people are not being misjudged and their support taken for things which they do not desire.<lb/>
My solution of the difficulties in which we are placed may not be perfect. I am very far indeed from being conceited enough to suggest that it cannot be improved in matters of detail or of drafting. At least I venture to say to your Lordships that the idea which underlies it is worth discussing seriously in a concrete form. No doubt with many of your Lordships the theoretical and technical difficulties will bulk largely, but I want you on the debate on the Second Reading on which we are now engaged to endeavour to look at the wide broad issues which are involved in the discussion in which we are engaged. On the other hand, as I have said, I know that some of the clauses in this Bill may seem difficult of acceptance. Some may hesitate, even though generally in favour of the proposals, to vote for the Second Reading for fear of being classed as agreeing with every jot or every tittle of what is
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0359"/>
<col>667</col>
in the Bill. On that matter I am entirely in the hands of the House as to further procedure. But I do say from profound conviction, from such consideration as I have been able to rive to the whole of the circumstances in which we are placed, that in some form or another some such proposals as I venture to make to the House are unavoidable; and at any rate I honestly believe that in the last resort they may be found to afford at least a possible chance of reconciling some of the differences which divide us at the present time. My Lords, I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01449">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01450"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we must all feel, and the state of the House shows that we do feel, that we are to-night opening the first page of one of the most momentous chapters in the Constitutional history of our country. I am sorry to find myself differing from the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of this Bill. I am afraid I do differ from him upon this Bill. I not only cannot vote for the Bill, but it seems to me so full of far-reaching evil that I am bound to vote against it. I recall with interest and gratification that remarkable speech which my noble friend made in November, 1909, when he used language to your Lordships some of which I will reproduce. Speaking on the noble Marquess's Motion in reference to the Finance Bill of that year, the noble Lord said&#x2014;
<quote>"My Lords, if you win, the victory can at most be a temporary one. If you lose you have altered and prejudiced the position, the power, the prestige, the usefulness of this House which I believe every one of you honours and desires to serve as heartily and as thoroughly as I do myself. If you win you are but beginning a conflict."</quote>
My Lords, to-night we are beginning it. We are in a conflict which has been forced upon us, upon both Parties and upon the nation, by time and circumstances; but the decision to which this House has to come to-morrow night on the Bill of my noble friend opens, I repeat, the first page of a tremendous chapter.<lb/>
What has happened within the eighteen months since the noble Lord made these observations? According to one of its most illustrious Members this House has ceased to exist. It has passed Resolutions to the effect that, as it was eighteen months
<col>668</col>
ago and as it is to-day, it ought to cease to exist. The Resolutions passed, on the motion partly of the noble Marquess opposite, are to the effect that this House as now constituted ought to cease to exist. The principle of the hereditary right to sit and vote in this House has vanished; and a few days ago and again to-night the Leader of the great majority of the House has told us that we shall soon have a Bill completely transforming the structure of this Assembly, and building, it is not too much to say, a new fabric upon the ruins of the present system. Two General Elections have taken place. All this great transformation has occurred in eighteen months. The picture is a startling one; and I declare that still more startling to me is the appearance of my noble friend's Bill. It is introduced by one of the most respected members of this House; it is likely here to receive the support, when the Division is taken, of noble Lords sitting on the Front Opposition Bench, and, perhaps, of the whole of those who sit behind them.<lb/>
I prefer to-night, if the House will allow me, to dwell on the details of the Bill, which are open, I venture to think, to enormous criticism. The noble Lord attempted to make a case for the Bill in the circumstances of the other House. Of course he agrees that the other House must predominate, and therefore it is to the interest of every patriotic citizen of this country to see that the best is done for the advantage of that House that the wit of man can procure. I have had a good chance of knowing the House of Commons very well. I sat there for twenty-five years, and in the first twelve of those years I sat for what was, at all events then, the largest constituency in the country. I had seven contested elections in twelve years, and I sat in that House mostly in Opposition. I believe that the picture which my noble friend has drawn, and still more the picture, which he reproduced, by Mr. Snowden&#x2014;a man whom I know, and of whom I always speak with respect&#x2014;are completely overcharged. I see more than one noble Lord who sat in the House of Commons when I did. They know that language of the same sort was used when Mr. Gladstone was Prime Minister it was said that he was a dictator; that men were delegates, and were only whipped round the Lobbies, and so on. Parliamentary life and electioneering, say
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0360"/>
<col>669</col>
what you like, are rough-and-tumble proceedings. You cannot avoid that. It is very well to draw ideal pictures of what a Member of Parliament ought to be, what an elector ought to be, and what Parliamentary life ought to be; but I do believe&#x2014;and I consult with Members of Parliament constantly&#x2014;that to say that independence has entirely disappeared is an exaggeration. And might I ask with all respect, as a comparative novice in this House, whether noble Lords do not very often follow their Leaders? I have not perceived once during the time I have been here any great sign of independence or dissent or of revolt on the part of noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
One of the three points of the noble Lord was that there was to be no dictation from outside bodies. I have heard of the Tariff Reform League; I have certainly heard of the Free Trade League; and I have heard, as we all have, of various leagues. Of course when men want to make their opinions prevail they must organise themselves, and by all the active means they can pursue to bring other men to share their opinions. That appears to me to he the manly, common-sense view of English public life; and therefore venture to think deliberately that, as far as my judgment goes, neither the Parliament Bill nor the Bill to be brought in by the noble Marquess can possibly produce effects so deep and so far-reaching, not merely upon institutions, but upon the spirit, the power, and the habits of mind of the people of this country. Far more important than any change which can come from any mere adjustment, important as you like&#x2014;I do not wish to belittle it&#x2014;proposed by the Parliament Bill, and than whatever the reconstitution of this House may mean and whatever shape it may take&#x2014;I do not believe that either of those two operations, important as they are, will produce anything comparable to the result which will follow from the principle which this Bill contains, and by voting for which your Lordships are sanctioning.<lb/>
I say of the principle of this Bill that it weakens the House of Commons, it weakens the House of Lords, it does a great deal to abolish the representative system, it wholly transforms our Parliamentary system, and it affects, as I may show, our Cabinet system. I cannot conceive, therefore, a more revolutionary principle to accept and
<col>670</col>
to apply widely, as it is intended, I understand, to be by and by, over the whole field of our Parliamentary life. No doubt an appeal to the people makes a splendid platform cry. As an old platform hand I realise that; but I should like to repeat the words of a member of this House which will carry more weight with noble Lords opposite than any words of mine. This is what Lord Curzon said&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"The counting of heals becomes an absurd and delusive method when the question at issue is one of great complexity, such as a Parliamentary Bill crammed with clauses and bristling with disputable propositions; and to proclaim that an appeal so, made and answered is irrefutable evidence of trust inn the people, and that a refusal to accept this test is proof of heresy to the democratic principle is, in my judgment, to show a very imperfect idea of the true meaning of popular government."</quote>
I am content to leave it in the language of the noble Lord. I have thought ever since these troubles began eighteen months; ago&#x2014;and I am sure a great many people have agreed with me&#x2014;that the proper way of solving the difficulties in which we found ourselves was a Convention formed as was that used in the constitution of the United States Government, and as now used when States alter their arrangements. The Conference was held, and the failure of the Conference convinced me, at any rate, that considering the men who composed it, considering the spirit in which, as I have always understood, its proceedings were conducted, considering the respectful attitude with which the country regarded it, if that Conference broke down, proceeding by way of Convention is impossible,. at all events in this country.<lb/>
A great number of men&#x2014;beginning with Sir William Anson, for example&#x2014;men well informed, with well-trained minds, deeply versed in all these questions, are dealing with the Referendum. This discussion of a Bill is not the occasion for going into all those arguments. They deserve attention, and they are sure to receive it. To-night we are dealing with a Bill, and I should like to say at once, without arrogance, that I for one attach no importance whatever to the analogies from Oregon, from America, from Switzerland, or elsewhere. It is quite true, as we are told&#x2014;though every part
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0361"/>
<col>671</col>
of the assertion is more or less disputed by somebody&#x2014;that the Referendum has worked well in those foreign places. Be it so. What reason is there for thinking that because it has worked well in Switzerland, with a gross population of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000, it will work well in a community numbering 44,000,000 or 50,000,000;that because it works well in a new and, without disrespect, may I say, in this respect a raw community like one of the American States named, therefore it could be transplanted to us, in whom the Parliamentary system is rooted by centuries of tradition in all of the habits of our mind, in the whole practice of our Parliamentary system, in the very marrow of our bones? It is idle to say that, because a given device and expedient works well somewhere else, therefore it may be expected very likely to work well in a community like ours. You cannot transplant devices and expedients without regard to all the changes involved&#x2014;changes of sky, of climate, of political soil.<lb/>
I now come to what I regard as a very vital part of the noble Lord's proposal. It turns on the question whether the resignation of a Ministry must follow the defeat of a Bill on the Referendum. Your Lordships will see in a moment that that is a vital point. It is easy to say, "We will think of that afterwards," but the question of resignation after the rejection of a Ministerial Bill is at the root of the whole matter. Just consider what would happen. Imagine the. Government have passed a Bill through the House of Commons and that it is rejected by your Lordships and is then rejected by a majority of the voters on a special appeal by way of the Referendum. Is the Government to resign? Take the case of 1886. There are only two members of this House who are survivors of that Government, and we can remember all about it. Suppose the Referendum had been in force in those days, and that after defeat Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues had said&#x2014;well, could they have said in common decency, with common sense, and with common political honour, "We shall continue in office. We shall take no notice of the Referendum, but will continue to administer the government of Ireland by the alternative, or what is called the coercive, system, against which we have been spending for ever so many months all our force in argument and even passionate appeal"?<lb/>
<col>672</col>
I will take a modern case that may appeal to many of your Lordships. Supposing that a Government of noble Lords opposite were to bring in a Tariff Reform scheme, and that it was rejected on the Referendum, is it to be supposed that Mr. Balfour would then bring in a Budget based on all the worn-out, exploded, musty Cobdenite principles It is absurd. Any noble Lord will see that it is ridiculous to assume for one moment that a Government which has been beaten on the Referendum could continue to govern. Now, why do I attach importance to that? I attach importance to it because you are giving to the Referendum the power not only of saying Aye or No to a given Bill, but of displacing a Government, and you are therefore giving the power of displacing a Government, for example, to this House. By one of the clauses of the Bill this House, by rejecting a Bill, can force a Referendum, so that the Referendum may be the means of displacing a Government. That is a new, or almost new pretension.<lb/>
I should like to bring another set of facts or probabilities before your Lordships' House when you are discussing this Referendum. My noble friend is a Unionist Free Trader. Suppose that the Referendum had been passed before the election of December,1910. We are now in the Spring of 1911. They are, on my hypothesis, busy in another place with an Irish Government Bill, a Home Rule Bill. That Bill, we will suppose, is passed by the House of Commons and is rejected by your Lordships. Then we have in July a Referendum, an appeal to the serene, broad, cool, philosophic judgment of the electors on the tranquilising topic of Home Rule. Suppose the Referendum ends in the rejection of Home Rule and Ministers resign. Then there is a new Government. The Government could not, of course, meet such an adverse House of Commons as exists at present across the corridor. They would, say in October of this year, dissolve, and there would be another General Election and a new Parliament. I hope this calendar does not weary the House. It is well worth thinking about what the Referendum means. Then in 1912 the new Government would bring in their Budget founded on Tariff Reform, as they propose to do. The House of Commons would go on debating that Budget until July, and then
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0362"/>
<col>673</col>
there would be a Referendum. On that Referendum they might be beaten. I am sure my noble friend would hope that they would be beaten. He is a Free Trader, and he must desire that his colleagues should be beaten. Then there is another General Election and another Ministry. My Lords, all that is within eighteen months; all these Referenda and General Elections, all this confusion and turmoil. That is what my noble friend will get if his Referendum is carried&#x2014;I will not say this particular Referendum, but if the Referendum is accepted. Noble Lords may think there is an inaccuracy in that calendar. I believe not. I believe that that is what might happen, and although noble Lords are not going to be candidates, at least under our present system, this prospect of Referendum after Referendum would really&#x2014;I was going to say, can folly go further? but I withdraw it.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, let us look for a moment at what the operation of this Referendum is going to be. We all know perfectly well what elections are like, and the idea is&#x2014;and my noble friend did not get much beyond it in his speech&#x2014;and it gives a certain amount of fascination to the Referendum, that a reply postcard is to be forwarded to every elector and that you will get his reply by return of post.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01453"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>:I beg the noble Viscount's pardon, but I say nothing about post cards in my Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01454"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is far too practised a man of business to put it in his Bill, but that is the idea in the minds of people who know less about it than my noble friend does. I respectfully invite any noble Lord to take up this Bill and master its contents. I believe that if you do that you will agree with me that the Referendum will mean on all great questions that all Parties will wish&#x2014;of course they will&#x2014;to convert the electors. There will be meetings, there will be literature, there will be posters, there will be the tracing of removals, and I believe the conveyance of voters to the poll is not prohibited. Those are Committee points, perhaps, but I do want your Lordships on the Second Reading of the Bill to realise as practical men what it means. Are there to be any limits to the expenditure? It
<col>674</col>
is said in one of the clauses that the Corrupt Practices Act and other Acts are to apply. Yes, but under the Corrupt Practices Act it is assumed that there is a candidate and an agent, and if mischief is proved the candidate is unseated and the agent may be sent to prison. No such punishment for misdeeds is possible under the Referendum. I do not say that ingenious lawyers cannot make contrivances, but as the Bill stands to talk of the Corrupt Practices Act is really farcical.<lb/>
I do not want to go into Committee points, but there is one clause in the Bill that both fascinates and astonishes me. I refer to Clause 12, which says that nobody shall vote more than once on that day. After all the arguments we have heard of the advantage of having little owners of property and all the rest of it, these poor men are to be confined to one vote, and you are introducing in this Bill the very principle that you have contumeliously rejected on former occasions. I applaud your Lordships' late repentance. Now let us look a little further on. Let us assume that the writ arrives in seven days and that there is all the turmoil of an election. What is the voter doing? He is to have an opportunity of inspecting at the office of the Chief Returning Officer the Bill on which he is to pronounce Aye or No, perhaps a Bill of 100 or 120 clauses. I am not sure that noble Lords in this House have so keen an appetite for any Bill of 100 or 120 clauses, but there is to be this little <i>queue</i> or crowd of earnest voters waiting outside the Returning Officer's office to get an inspection of this Bill. When they get that inspection what will happen? A Bill is a very difficult and technical subject; we all know that draughtsman's English is not the English of Bunyan, Defoe, or Swift; and I have always had suspicions&#x2014;I do not know if noble Lords opposite are exempt from them&#x2014;that even Cabinet Ministers do not always show an eagerness to study a Bill even when it is circulated in the Cabinet by their most valued colleagues.<lb/>
What would the voter do? Let us take by way of illustration the Irish Church Bill of 1869. As everybody knows, the Parliamentary storm and stress of that Bill mainly turned on Disendowment, and it was only passed after enormous difficulty by means of a number of equit-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0363"/>
<col>675</col>
able qualifications and nice adjustments which Mr. Gladstone' introduced into the Bill and persuaded the Party opposite to accept. Can any one suppose for one instant that, even if he had nothing else to do, an elector would in those clays have spent five minutes over reading the Disendowment Bill? No. We all know, to be perfectly frank, what the elector would have said then, and what the elector would say now. He would say that Mr. Gladstone, or Mr. Disraeli, if you like, knows a great deal more than I do about these things, and I will vote for Gladstone, or I will vote for Disraeli. That is what the magnified will of the people really comes to.<lb/>
May I say that I conceive that to set up as the great cardinal and organic standard of Parliamentary life the standard of always consulting and being guided by and thinking of nothing else but what the people desire is to my mind a thoroughly wrong standard. I am quite prepared to defend that proposition. What Ministers or legislative Houses ought to be considering is what they believe, after the best search, inquiry, and deliberation, is for the good government of the country, and I am always sorry when I hear people using that expression in the sense that Ministers and Members of Parliament or Members of this House are not to have minds of their own, but are always to be wondering what somebody else is desiring or thinking.<lb/>
Let us still keep our eye on the voter. The voter is to say Aye or No, according to my noble friend's Bill, to a whole Bill. If he hates Clause 5, lie will vote "No." If somebody else hates Clause 9, he also will vote "No." So a Referendum is very apt to mean this. It accumulates in negatives all who happen to dissent from this or that single detail. That is an absurdity. I said in the beginning something about the effect of the Referendum upon the minds of Cabinets and Ministers. Must not the incidental effect upon the mind of the Minister framing a Bill be this? He will inevitably, he cannot help it, before framing each clause, however well he thinks of it, ask himself, if the Referendum policy is unfortunately accepted by Parliament and the country, whether this or that wording of a clause would be likely to tempt and provoke a Referendum, and how much surface that clause would expose to the mind of the
<col>676</col>
elector when he came to vote. I throw that out as a hint, and those who are aware of these things may know the value of it. I quite understood all the points my noble friend made as to the reason why he had put into this Bill the plain abrupt proposition that a Bill, not an abstract Resolution, not a fine declaration of abstract doctrine, must be referred to the electorate. He also told us that under the Bill 200 gentlemen in the House of Commons are, if they like, to compel the reference of a Bill.<lb/>
I was enormously interested the other day in a remarkable project which was half fathered by the noble Earl opposite, Lord Selborne. He enumerated a long list of possible suggestions for a working Referendum, but this was the one which most struck my imagination. He said that at the beginning of every Parliament there should be a small Joint Committee of the two Houses appointed in strict proportion to the number of the parties in it. That Committee would really contain the best men of both Houses. It would be presided over by the Speaker, and in that Committee the minority of either House might appeal to the majority to invoke a Referendum. If they got, as the noble Earl thought they would, a Committee filled with a very high sense of its Constitutional responsibility, it would take care that frivolous proposals for invoking the Referendum were not allowed, and on the other hand, it would feel it to be its duty to see that on any really grave issue of national importance the electors had the opportunity of registering their decision.</membercontribution></p>

There is a great majority, or a small majority, as the result; a coalition majority of our sort, or a coalition majority of your sort. There are more coalitions than one. Parliament is installed, and the first business, according to the noble Earl, under the proposal for which he is going to say a good deal, is to choose half a dozen or half a score of the best men, excluding, I take it, the two Front Benches.

What are they to do? They are to decide as they please, and when they please, whether on any given question they are to give the minority the right of appealing to the electors to think it all over again and once inure try to turn a minority into a majority. This body, though small, is to be really omnipotent. I am not, at all exaggerating what follows from that. It can overrule the Cabinet, which is content with its majority. It can overrule the majority of the men elected, and it can overrule the majority of electors who chose them. It can, in effect, force what is tantamount to a new election. You talk of parties and groups as being the great evil of Parliamentary life, but the noble Earl's plan would invent a new group which is to swallow up, on any critical or decisive occasion, all other parties and groups wholesale.

But they are one of the swarm of random and fantastic ideas that are floating through people's irresponsible minds, and I for one am thoroughly grateful to the noble Lord, because I think he spoke well when he said to-night that he thought it desirable that there should be a concrete plan before the country, and when that set of proposals is put before the country I shall be delighted to see it. That is not the only random set of ideas. The air is thick with fantastic notions, and that is one of the reasons why I am glad we have now got a Bill.<lb/>
I regret to understand that what noble Lords are going to do to-morrow night is to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill. I am perfectly certain that from the moment I sit clown until the moment the Division is taken we shall hear from noble Lords opposite, "Well, we think there is something in what you say, hut we are only voting for the principle of the Bill." I hope when we are told this that we shall hear what is the principle of the Bill. It is not an automatic Referendum. It is not a compulsory or an obligatory Referendum. It does not touch the tremendously important question whether the electors should have an initiative outside of Parliament, and you may depend upon it, if you once adopt the policy of the Referendum it will inevitably lead to the policy of initiative outside. I do not believe that anybody who knows the electors of this country, or who works out in his own mind the course of argument that would be likely to follow, would doubt that the right of initiation would be sure to come. I think I have seen some important public men advocate that, 'but, however that may be, I think it is sure to come. The Bill does not sanction the putting on one side of any proposal; that is, no doubt, a good thing; but they have to say Yes or No to a Bill, even though the electors giving their votes would have preferred a different Bill, or would have preferred one of the drafts or prints they had seen or heard of. That is one difficulty which is worth considering.<lb/>
I am going to quote the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, again, because he put this point exactly as I would try to put it myself. He said the Referendum is to be applied whenever there is any irreconcilable difference between the Lords and the Commons. That is clear under
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0365"/>
<col>679</col>
the Bill. That gives the Lords the power of forcing an instant appeal from the majority in the House of Commons, though that majority has just been elected, whenever they choose to be irreconcilable, and an appeal, let us mark, not only on the view of the electorate on a given Bill, but an appeal that would mean the displacement of a Government that had the confidence and support of the House of Commons. The noble Lord also said this, on the same date I think&#x2014;
<quote>"Is not a Referendum in the hands of the Lords equivalent to the prerogative of forcing a Dissolution whenever they please? "</quote>
That was the view that commended itself then to the noble Lord's mind, and it is undoubtedly the true interpretation of the meaning and working of the Referendum. It is the assertion of a proposition which I am assured you will never persuade the constituencies of this country to accept, that this House, however reformed or reconstituted, should have the right to force a Dissolution.<lb/>
My Lords, I will not detain you further. The situation brings to my mind a passage from Burke, which I would like to read. In doing so, I shall not be suspected, I hope, of referring to any individual person. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"An ignorant man who is not fool enough to meddle with his clock, is, however, sufficiently confident to think he can safely take to pieces, and put together at his pleasure, a moral machine of another guise, importance, and complexity, composed of far other wheels and springs and balances, and counteracting and co-operating powers."</quote>
That, my Lords, is the kind of undertaking we are now almost forced to contemplate. What makes me feel anxious to-night is that not only are you embarking, by proposing the Referendum, on a policy and a set of expedients that break up the Parliamentary system and the representative system, but the free use of the Referendum tends to shake the stability of mind of the electors. This ideal is to displace altogether in the imagination and minds of those who resort to it so freely and with such gaiety of heart the old ideal of a Parliament which should last four, five, or six years, and of Ministers who begin their work confident that they will have the support of the constituencies for most of that time. There you have an instrument and a system of infinite stability. What shocks me is that this House, the defenders of Conservative
<col>680</col>
ideals and principles, are going in the first fight of this great Constitutional engagement which confronts us to do the best that lies in their power to shake that stability which is the glory and has been the safety of this country. My Lords, I am not very fond of talking of the civilised world, but the civilised world is looking on rather eagerly and wondering whether the political wisdom of this country is really impaired. May I say this, and this only&#x2014;If you get the reputation of a nation whose governors have lost the faculty of political wisdom you lose an asset more valuable and powerful than many Dreadnoughts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01463"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh will not have allowed himself for a moment to believe that my absence from this House the other evening when he introduced his Bill was due to any indifference on my part, or to any want of respect towards himself. I ant glad this evening to congratulate him upon the reception of his Bill, and to acknowledge the service which he has rendered to the House by bringing us to close quarters with the discussion of this most important subject. I am, as my noble friend well knows, a believer in the Referendum. I am not sure that I can travel to the length of my noble friend, because there are some points in which his Bill certainly carries us further than I am myself disposed to go. But I believe in the principle of the Referendum, and I am particularly glad that my noble friend should have been the man to take up the question in this House.<lb/>
My noble friend occupies a somewhat exceptional position amongst the members of your Lordships' House. I will say nothing of the address and business-like ability with which he takes part in our affairs from time to time, but he has held very high office, and outside Parliament he has been either president or a member of, I should think, more important public inquiries, Committees, and Royal Commissions than any other member of this House. The last two Royal Commissions over which he presided were the Commission on Food Supply in Time of War, appointed by the late Government, and the Commission dealing with the trade relations of Canada and the West Indies, appointed by the Government represented on the Benches opposite. Then
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0366"/>
<col>681</col>
the noble Lord has riot for the first time given this House invaluable assistance by coming to our rescue at a time when serious illness had laid low the Chairman of our Committees. My Lords, I dwell upon these things because I do think that when such a man with such a reputation for common sense and ability makes himself sponsor for this Bill, we have about reached the time when the Referendum can no longer be described as a mere crotchet or fad. It is absurd to suppose that after such a career as I have ventured to describe, my noble friend has suddenly taken leave of his senses, and has made himself responsible for an absurd and fantastic proposal, which noble Lords opposite are fond of describing as an absurd invention designated by a doglatin name and occasionally mistaken for some variety of turnip or potato. I think the part which my noble friend has taken justifies us at any rate in hoping that criticisms of that kind will be no more heard of in connection with this subject.<lb/>
Now my Lords, in our view there is not only room for the Referendum in our Constitutional machinery, but we believe that its introduction into that machinery has become positively indispensable. We affirmed that view in a Resolution which we passed in this House last year. May I briefly say why it seems to me that the Referendum, for some purposes, at all events, has become an inevitable addition to our Parliamentary machinery? I do not think I shall be contradicted when if say that up to the present time both the great Parties of the State have proceeded upon the understanding, that no great and fundamental changes should be introduced by legislation unless the people of this country have had a sufficient and full opportunity of pronouncing judgment upon them. It was the special function of this House to see to it that such an opportunity should be given, and it is only now, under the new policy of His Majesty's Government, that we have it deliberately announced that for the future the people of this country are to be denied the opportunity which they have hitherto enjoyed of pronouncing upon these great and grave issues. The new policy is a policy of setting up an infallible and supreme House of Commons. We ask whether you can seriously believe that any settlement based on that assumption is likely to be permanently accepted by this country.<lb/>
<col>682</col>
We ask whether you can point to any other country that is governed upon that principle. We point out, further, that you yourselves by your present action are doing a great deal to render your own position untenable. You are deeply pledged as a Party to House of Lords reform. Some of your supporters may be insincere; I think they are; but as a Government, ever since you put into the mouth of his late Majesty King Edward VII the last Speech which he delivered from the Throne, you, as a Government, have pledged yourselves to deal not only with the relations of the two Houses but with the reform of this House, I will not say simultaneously, but upon parallel lines, as two parts of a policy founded not upon one of those proposals, but founded upon both. If, however, you are, indeed, going to reconstitute this House, is it not perfectly evident that the more authority you give it, and the better balanced its composition, the less likely will the people of this country be to allow the decisions of such a House to be set on one side and ignored '? The closer the reformed House of Lords is in touch with the people of the country, the less will you be able to treat it as a mere appanage of the other House of Parliament. There will be differences under the new system as there have been under the old, and in our belief the adoption of the Referendum in one shape or another affords the only means of extricating Parliament from the difficulty and restoring the proper balance of the Constitution.<lb/>
My Lords, for my part, I am persuaded that the movement of public opinion in this country is declaring itself decidedly in favour of the adoption of the Referendum. I do not believe that many of the members of the Party opposite are prepared to go the length of saying that in no circumstances is the Referendum possible. That is not the view of the Prime Minister, for he said not long ago that he would not rule out the Referendum as a possible practicable expedient for dealing with some exceptional cases. That is a very important admission.<lb/>
The noble Earl who leads the House (the Earl of Crewe), and whose absence we all deeply regret, said the other day that he would admit the Referendum for Constitutional changes where you have a
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0367"/>
<col>683</col>
written Constitution. Yes, but are you not going to give us, if you have your own way, an instalment of a written Constitution in the shape of the Parliament Bill? Then there is the practice of other countries and of some of our great Colonies, which, as we know, have adopted the Referendum. I admit the justice of the noble Viscount's remark that it would not be wise to press foreign or Colonial analogies too far, and I shall not do so, for it is obvious that there is a wide difference between the circumstances which prevail in the countries where the Referendum is used and in this country; but surely the fact that it has been adopted in other countries and that where it has been adopted it has never been done away with subsequently, together with the fact that you yourselves have given the Referendum deliberately to a great British Dominion across the sea, is enough to justify us in asking that you shall not leave the Referendum out of court and treat it as a fantastic or revolutionary proposal.<lb/>
Let me for a moment glance at one or two of the objections taken by the noble Viscount to the Bill. He said my noble friend's was a. revolutionary policy. He objected to the Bill on that rather remarkable ground. I think he gave us a quotation from Burke with reference to an ignorant man who had the imprudence to pull a clock to pieces. I did not exactly gather the words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01464"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: He said that a man who is not such a fool as to meddle with his clock is supposed to feel quite ready to go and meddle with the Constitution of his country with all its springs and balances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01465"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Let us accept the analogy. Are noble Lords opposite not meddling with the clock? My noble friend dealt very well, I thought, with the revolutionary argument, but he might have gone further. He might have asked the noble Viscount what right he and his friends had to talk about revolutionary expedients. Was there ever a more revolutionary expedient than the Parliament Bill, which exposes this country to single-Chamber government by virtually depriving this House of the whole of its opportunities of revising or reserving legislation? Has the noble Viscount never heard of another proposal, not perhaps
<col>684</col>
very often paraded by Ministers, but constantly mentioned by their supporters in the country&#x2014;the proposal that in the event of this House not being complaisant in the matter of the Parliament Bill that Bill is to be passed into law by an expedient which has been described by the highest constitutional authorities as an unconstitutional and revolutionary expedient?<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I want to say one word on the main argument which ran throughout the whole of the speech of the noble Viscount and which always occupies the most prominent position in the arguments of noble Lords opposite. We are told that the advocacy of the Referendum shows a distrust of the representative system and a desire to overthrow that system. That is a very erroneous and misleading way of describing our position. What we desire to do is not to upset the representative system but to find a means of correcting some of its most flagrant and palpable defects, defects which become more flagrant and more palpable with every year of our Parliamentary history. My Lords, what is your reading of the representative system which we now enjoy? It is based upon two assumptions. The assumption of noble Lords opposite is first that a House of Commons majority, no matter how composed or how small, is the unerring interpreter of the will of the constituencies, even when that majority is a composite one, or, as I think Mr. Asquith once described it, a scratch majority, and even if it is a matter of common notoriety that it is a majority composed of sections which support the Government, not because they are really in harmony with the Government's proposals, but in order to keep the Government in power until an ulterior object has been achieved. We had a case the other day in the House of Commons when a leading Irish Member objected to the Naval Estimates but voted for them because he had no idea of turning the Government out.<lb/>
Then it is assumed that the infallibility of the House of Commons majority lasts from one General Election until the next General Election, whatever has happened in the meantime. I should rather like to examine that claim for a moment. At a General Election the electors hear a candidate's speeches, read his address&#x2014;they may or may not understand the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0368"/>
<col>685</col>
subjects referred to&#x2014;and then they send him to Parliament, according to noble Lords opposite, with plenipotentiary powers to represent them on all occasions and in regard to all possible subjects. The Lord Chancellor has given us a quite engaging picture of the manner in which the system works. He says the poor electors are far too busy to occupy themselves with matters of detail, and they therefore choose honourable men whose judgment they can trust. My noble friend Lord Balfour described with great effect what happens with regard to the honourable men when they get to the House of Commons. They are shepherded by the Whips, and apparently one of them, at least, Mr. Snowden, greatly resents the process, and his evidence is of a kind which noble Lords opposite will find it a little difficult to dispose of.<lb/>
While we have had some account from Mr. Snowden of the way in which the private Member regards the manipulations of the Party Whips, we had last year in this House from an ex-Whip, Lord Marchamley, some account of the way in which the Whip regards the operations of the private Member. I have quoted the words before, but they are so appropriate to the present occasion that I will quote them again. The noble Lord told us that a Chief Whip worth his salt has no political conscience whatever. When he is told that he must whip for any self-evident proposal, such as that black is white, he does so with the same alacrity and eagerness as if he believed it; so that these honourable men who have come down to the House of Commons entrusted with plenary powers by their constituents to represent them have to say, "This looks black, but we are told it is white; let us make it white and vote for it." The noble Viscount let fall one observation somewhat in the nature of a <i>to quoque</i>. He said that if in the House of Commons people voted not quite in accordance with their convictions, but according to the pressure of the Party wirepullers, such things happened in this House also. The noble Viscount, I honestly believe, like many noble Lords opposite, greatly overrates the power of Lord Waldegrave and those who assist him in applying anything like what might be called coercion. I would, however, point out to the noble Viscount that there is really a little difference. Supposing noble Lords on the Back Benches receive a Whip and disregard it when they come here and
<col>686</col>
drift into the wrong Lobby, or do not come here at all, it would be quite impossible for us to visit their sins upon them in an effectual manner. In the House of Commons things happen very differently, for a man who gets into the, black books of the Whips will find when a General Election comes round that there is another candidate and no seat is provided for him elsewhere. There is, therefore, very little application to the state of affairs in this House in the noble Viscount's argument. I say, then, with regard to this particular point, that when the noble Viscount sets up as a kind of idol the so-called representative system, and bids us to fall down and grovel at its feet, we have to take into account what kind of an idol it is and what material it is made of, and I am afraid we shall be obliged to admit that there is a considerable amount of clay in its composition.<lb/>
The noble Viscount dealt at great length with the unfairness of puzzling and distracting the electors by asking them to vote on a particular Bill which might be extremely intricate and complex, and he drew a humorous picture of the villagers drawn out in a lengthy <i>queue</i> outside the office where a copy of the Bill was on view. I admit quite freely to the noble Viscount that there must be many eases where the issues involved in a great measure are of an extremely complicated kind, or perhaps of a kind which a great many of the humbler voters are not able thoroughly to understand or appreciate, but in most cases nevertheless I am under the impression that in a rough and ready kind of way electors are quite shrewd and intelligent enough to know whether they want a Bill passed or do not. At all events our proposal has this merit, that it gives the electors a single Bill for their opinion, and focuses attention upon that one Bill, whereas now you give to the same men, not one Bill, but a bundle of Bills, and sometimes no Bill at all, on the subjects upon which their opinions are invited. You at this moment I believe claim to have a mandate in favour of the Parliament Bill. The Parliament Bill, if I remember right, was produced at the last moment at our instance in this House. But for that, I do not think it would have been produced at all; yet it is contended that the Parliament Bill and all its details could have been mastered by the voters, together with the details of a non-existent
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0369"/>

Home Rule Bill, which was also dangled before them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01467"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, but it was never discussed. At any rate the poor puzzled distracted elector for whom the noble Viscount has such sympathy will have a better chance of understanding the issues when a Bill has been discussed in both Houses, and will be better able to say whether he wishes to have the Bill passed or not when the subject has been thoroughly thrashed out. At the present time the distracted elector is asked to make up his mind on these subjects in the midst of all the turmoil and excitement of a General Election, when the fate of a Government is trembling in the balance, when the fates of Members of Parliament are trembling in the balance; and surely if electors are intelligent enough to come to a conclusion to select the right man and give their mandate in such circumstances, they have sufficient intelligence to form an opinion on a concrete measure presented to them by itself and upon its own merits.<lb/>
All I wish to say as to these complaints of the intricacy of subjects submitted to Referendum, the confusing nature of the appeal, and its disturbing effect on the country, is that all these complaints seem to arise from what I cannot help thinking is a mistaken apprehension of what is likely to happen under any Referendum proposals which we are likely to accept. The noble Viscount seemed to think we should live in an atmosphere of constant reference, that not only every session, but possibly every month might bring about a reference to the people. That is not my anticipation; nor will I consent to any Bill likely to have that effect. If my noble friend Lord Balfour will forgive me, I will make this criticism on his Bill, that I think it does lend itself too much to the objection that it might lead to the submission of Bills to the people more frequently than we desire or than would be desirable in the public interest. My noble friend divides his Bills into two classes. There is, in the first place, the class of Bills which have been passed by
<col>688</col>
one House of Parliament and rejected by the other. He calls those "rejected" Bills. Now these rejected Bills are, under my noble friend's proposal, to be invariably sent to a Referendum.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01468"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Marquess's pardon. Only on the demand of one House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01469"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS of LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I assume that, but it may be any Bill and it may be on the first rejection of the Bill, I think within thirty days.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01470"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH1</member><membercontribution>: No, there is no limit of time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01471"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend's other proposal is with regard to what he calls "carried" Bills&#x2014;Bills passed by both Houses of Parliament, but which may be sent to a Referendum if 200 Members of the House of Commons demand it but he said very fairly that his figure of 200 was a figure which was liable to consideration. Well, my Lords, both of those proposals seem to me to go rather farther than it would be desirable for us to go at the present moment; both of them, I think, are calculated to create the anticipation that appeals to the people are likely to be more frequent, and consequently more costly and more disturbing than we believe they will be and should be.<lb/>
If I may state in half-a-dozen sentences the kind of proposal which would commend itself to me as an alternative to that of my noble friend, I would say that in my view we should look to the Referendum primarily and mainly as a quite exceptional measure for the purpose of putting an end to a persistent difference of opinion between the two Houses and a persistent difference of opinion with regard to important subjects. I am sure the noble Viscount remembers the words of the Resolution which was carried in this House last year. It was then our view that the Referendum should be resorted to for the purpose of adjusting differences between the two Houses in relation to matters of great gravity not adequately submitted to the judgment of the people. We also proposed that the Referendum should be resorted to as a last resort when other expedients had been exhausted. By other expedients I mean, of course, Conferences between the two Houses of Parliament, which I believe are regarded with general favour,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0370"/>
<col>689</col>
and which I hope in time will take a more conspicuous place in our proceedings than they have hitherto; and, in the next place, possibly Joint Sittings, supposing that Joint Sittings should be introduced as part of our Constitutional machinery. We also contemplated that the Referendum should not be used until after there had been two rejections of a Bill by this House, and these other expedients had been resorted to and had failed. It seems to me obvious&#x2014;I say it in passing&#x2014;that if we have, as I hope we may eventually, a better composed House, a House in which the representation of the two Parties will be better balanced than at present, there will be much greater opportunities of adjusting differences, either by means of Conferences or by means of Joint Sittings, than is likely in the House as we now know it, in which the Party to which I belong constitutes a quite overwhelming numerical majority.<lb/>
Then we are told that a proposal such as we indicated last year has this necessary consequence, that you must have a definition specifying those subjects which are worthy of being treated as grave subjects; and it is added that the further consequence follows that you must have a tribunal to decide whether a given subject does or does not fall within the definition. I do not know that I should be greatly deterred even if it were the case that this proposal carried with it the necessity of a definition and of a tribunal. I can conceive a definition, and I think I can conceive a tribunal that might answer the purpose. You have a tribunal somewhat of the kind, I think, in your Parliament Bill. I do not press that matter now. But what I do wish to say is this, that even if you have no definition and no tribunal, it seems to me quite possible that the common sense of Parliament will be sufficient to enable it to decide upon broad common-sense grounds whether a particular issue is one which ought to go to a Referendum or not. I cannot conceive a body of Members of Parliament wanting to send to a Referendum a Bill dealing with the inspection of gipsy caravans, or with juvenile smoking, or anything of that kind, and I should myself be very well content to look forward to the settlement of these questions, as I said just now, by the broad common sense of Parliament. But to come back to my point. To my mind the obvious and the main use of the Referendum must be for
<col>690</col>
the purpose of getting over persistent differences between the two Houses when those differences relate to a matter of-serious importance.<lb/>
I must say one word, and one word only, with regard to my noble friend's other proposal&#x2014;namely, that the Referendum should be used in cases where the two Houses are not in disagreement but have agreed to pass a certain Bill. I am aware that a great deal can be said for the view that in such cases also the Referendum may be usefully invoked for the purpose of protecting a minority against rash and ill-considered legislation notably when such rash and ill-considered legislation involves any tampering with the Constitution of the country. I think there is a great deal to be said for that view. But I would certainly at this point also restrict the use of the Referendum much more closely than my noble friend Lord Balfour. I am of raid that a general feeling of resentment and impatience would be created if, when the two Houses of Parliament had laboriously carried a Bill to a successful issue, it then could be taken away from Parliament on the motion, let us say of one-third of the members of the House of Commons, and the question reopened before a poll of the people. I am afraid the effect of a proposal of that kind would be to increase and not diminish the suspicion with which the Referendum is regarded in many quarters.<lb/>
I venture, however, to suggest that is a point which we are really not in a position to decide this evening, and I will say why I think so. In a case such as I am endeavouring to discuss the Referendum would be used for the purpose of protecting the country and the minority in Parliament against rash and ill-conceived legislation. Is it not true to say that if you are introducing a. safeguard of this kind in order to guard against a risk, you must have before you construct your safeguard some idea at any rate of the kind of risk against which you have got to guard? But the risk which I have in my mind would vary very greatly according to the constitution and attributes of your reformed House of Lords. If you have an independent House of Lords so composed that it commands a. large measure of public confidence, then the chances of the kind of ill-considered and hasty legislation which we seek to guard against are very greatly diminished, and the need of the-safeguard is diminished also. On the other hand, if you have a weak and helpless House
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0371"/>
<col>691</col>
of Lords, liable to be completely overruled by the other House of Parliament, then obviously there can be no check upon rash and ill-considered legislation, and the need of the safeguard becomes much greater and your care in constructing it will have to be much greater also. My Lords, I do venture to say that that is a point upon which it would be premature for us at this stage to express any decided opinion, and therefore, while I am very far from desiring to exclude the use of the Referendum in cases where the two Houses are in agreement, I submit that it is better that we should reserve judgment on that point until we know more of the lines upon which the question of House of Lords reform is likely to be settled.<lb/>
My Lords, there is one other use of the Referendum as to which I should like to say a word. There is the case where the two Houses are in agreement and have passed a Bill, but where it might be desired, perhaps by the Government of the day itself, to make sure that it had the opinion of the country at its back before the Bill became law. I am sure noble Lords opposite will not be slow to perceive that I am referring to such a use of the Referendum as was suggested by Mr. Balfour in his memorable announcement at the Albert Hall last year. That pledge, of course, will be fulfilled whenever we have an opportunity of fulfilling it. I might be asked in what manner, under any scheme of Referendum which we might be prepared to accept, that could be done. You could without difficulty, I have no doubt, add to the Referendum Bill a clause giving power to the Government of the clay to call for a Referendum in circumstances such as I have described. I am, however, not at all sure that it would be necessary to do so, because if you have a Referendum Act in existence containing the whole machinery of the Referendum in the body of the Act, it seems quite obvious that any Government could thereafter attach to any Bill a clause laying it down that the Bill in question should go to <i>ad hoc</i> Referendum of the electors.<lb/>
The noble Viscount opposite dwelt with some earnestness on the effect which an unsuccessful Referendum of this kind might have upon the Ministry of the day, and said it would inevitably mean that the Ministry would have to resign. Would it not be fair to reply that the political effect of the Referendum would depend entirely upon the
<col>692</col>
circumstances in which it was taken and the magnitude of the matter re<ob/>erred? I am entirely unable to see that if a Government were beaten on a Referendum it would necessarily involve their going out of office. That by no means follows. But if the question referred was one of reall<ob/> vital moment and one which deeply stirres<ob/> the people of this country and the Government were beaten on it, then I think it very likely the Government would have to reign It would be quite right that the Government should resign, because it would have been brought home to them that they had lost the confidence of the body of the electors of the country. And that result, which might be a desirable result, would be achieved by a much more specific and distinct process than could be the case under the <ob/>resent circumstances, when all these old cores are held over until the next General Election, and when the electors have to vote for against a Government, not on one issue, but upon a great number of conflicting issues<lb/>
Now, my Lords, it only retains for me to state what action I propose to take with reference to this Bill. In the first place, I say that nothing will indu<ob/>e me to vote against the Bill of my noble friend. I think he has done good service in bringing this question forward. I am with him in principle in holding that the Referendum sooner or later will have to be admitted into our Parliamentary system. But I am bound to add that there are some points which I have indicated in my noble friend's Bill which go so much further than I am prepared to go that I really should be reluctant as at present advise to go into the Lobby with him, because if I do so I shall be told that I am in favour of the use of the Referendum to an extent which I do not at all contemplate, and I should my myself open to some of the animadversions of the noble Viscount opposite. Therefore I hope my noble friend will forgive me or making the suggestion that the best thing which could happen for the cause of the Referendum, in which he and I are both alike interested would be that we should take a full and, I hope, a prolonged <ob/>oiscussion upon the Bill, but that, for the present at any rate, he should avoid asking us to say "Aye" or "No" the Second Reading of the Bill as it stands. I cannot help feeling that to him and all of us a few weeks' delay may not be with out advantage. The next few weeks will certainly be instructive to us, because after they have passed
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0372"/>
<col>693</col>
we shall know a little more than we do at present of the Government's views as to House of Lords reform. When the Bill which I shall introduce comes up for consideration we shall make it our business to endeavour to probe their minds and to draw from them something a little more precise in regard to that part of the question than they have yet vouchsafed to the public. But that is not all we shall gain. The discussion on the Parliament Bill is about to proceed in the House of Commons, and my noble friend is no doubt aware that some of those who usually act with us intend to move Amendments with the object of grafting the Referendum at a particular point upon the provisions of that Bill. After a delay such as I have suggested we shall at any rate have more precise information derived from those two sources&#x2014;what will happen in this House on the one hand and what will happen in the other House of Parliament on the other hand&#x2014;and we shall be better able to judge than we are at present what is the best course to pursue with regard to the Bill of my noble friend. Meanwhile he has done a great service, for which we ought to be sincerely grateful to him, in bringing about a full discussion&#x2014;and I trust it will be a very full and complete discussion&#x2014;of this most important question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01472"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>:My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, in his lightning tour in the provinces, made one remark which may, perhaps, have escaped the attention of some of your Lordships. He said that his great object was to try and bring this important subject before the notice of the man in the street. Well, in the few words in which T shall attempt to answer the speech of the noble Marquess&#x2014;and I promise the House to be brief&#x2014;I shall try, as well as I can, to lay before your Lordships the views of the man in the street who holds Liberal and Radical opinions, so far as I am able to understand him. If he had had an opportunity of attending the debate this evening, the first thing the Man in the street would say would be, "What an extraordinary <i>impasse</i> the House of Lords has got into on the present occasion" He would remember that it was about seven years ago that four distinguished members of this House separated themselves from their Party&#x2014;Lord Gosehen, the Duke of Devonshire,
<col>694</col>
Lord Ritchie, and Lord Balfour of Burleigh. Three of those noble Lords, unfortunately, have passed away, but it is no small tribute to the courage of the survivor, Lord Balfour, when we see, not only that he has taken a leaf out of the book of Jean Jacques Rousseau, but also of my friend Mr. Philip Snowden, as well as my noble friend and relative, Lord Weardale. We see the noble Lord to-day actually at id practically leading the serried masses of the Opposition on the Second Reading of a Bill on the main principles of which, we are informed, on the highest authority, the great Conservative Party mean to concentrate, and, if possible, to fight as well. I might quote the words of the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, who on the First Reading of the Bill said&#x2014;
<quote>"We take that [the Referendum] deliberately and finally as part of our plan and as our choice&#x2014;the Referendum to the electorate rather than the House of Commons and Ns temporary majority. it is our permanent contribution, and from it we shall not, recede."</quote>
Until the noble Marquess opposite sat down, we on this side of the House were under the impression that noble Lords opposite meant to divide&#x2014;to assert the principle of the Bill. But we have had, as usual, if I may say so without offence, a sudden change, and we now find the noble Marquess somewhat in agreement with one of the great organs of the Conservative Party, the <i>Morning Post</i>, which stated last week that Lord Selborne would not be able to get Englishmen to fight on the Referendum.<lb/>
The objects of this Bill have been explained to us, and I will not waste the time of your Lordships by recapitulating them. But I should like to call attention to a clause to which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition seemed to take most serious and not unnatural objection. I refer to Clause 2. When a Bill is passed by both Houses of Parliament the man in the street supposes that, if His Majesty is graciously pleased to give the Royal Assent, that Bill becomes law at once. But, according to Clause 2 of this Bill, if 200 or even 150 Members of the House of Commons petitioned against a Bill which had passed through both Houses, that Bill could be submitted to the Parliamentary electors, and if there were a majority of two per cent. against it it could not he submitted for the Royal Assent. Until five minutes ago this we understood to be the Conservative faith, in which the Party hoped to find salvation, and with which at the next
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0373"/>
<col>695</col>
General Election they hoped to sweep the country from one end to the other. But even on this point, up to this morning there did not seem to be absolute and entire agreement. May I again quote? It is from the <i>Morning Post</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"The argument in favour of it [the Referendum] drawn from the limited experience of its working is of very little valve indeed."</quote>
But we must not forget that, I think without exception, all the great pro-Consuls who have won fame in different parts of the Empire have declared themselves in favour of this policy. May I without offence respectfully suggest that some sort of arrangement had better be come to, for&#x2014;and I speak with all submission&#x2014;it would be as well if noble Lords opposite spoke to a certain extent with one voice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01473"><member>A NOBLE LORD</member><membercontribution>: Why? </membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01474"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Some of the great pro-Consuls opposite have highly approved of this policy, and on the First Reading of this Bill attention was called to the fact that the Referendum had worked extremely well in Natal. I am not going to trouble the House by referring to the various places where the Referendum is said to be a success; but I may mention, in passing, that the population of Natal is exactly the same as that of the Scottish county of Inverness. We were told that in Natal there were not more than 7,000 voters, and I should like to contrast that with one of the metropolitan boroughs, that of Walthamstow, where three elections were contested last year at very considerable cost. Thirty thousand voters recorded their votes, and the majority in favour of the Liberal Government was very nearly 4,000 strong. But still, as a former Colonial Governor, I am not going altogether to say that the Referendum in some countries does not work extremely well. Norfolk Island, a dependency of New South Wales, of which I had the honour of being Governor twenty years ago, is a paradise on earth, if there is one. It is au emerald green island, with beautiful trees, in the middle of a <i>lapis lazuli</i> sea. The population are descendants of British sailors who have married beautiful Tahitian women. There seems to be a sort of primitive beauty about that place which I have never seen elsewhere, except in the first act of a play called "The Arcadians."<lb/>
The men in Norfolk Island are great believers in the sanctity of the marriage state; but otherwise they hold everything
<col>696</col>
in common. It is a land of barter and exchange. The consequence is that there is no crime, for the simple reason that they have no money and no drink. I am far from saying that that is a state of things that would suit everybody; it might be styled rather a Rousseau's dream than a Scotsman's paradise. The Referendum works most admirably in that primitive community where every male over eighteen years of age not only has a vote but is a Member of Parliament. I will refer to one meeting of that Parliament. There is much grass in the place, and after luncheon we sat down. One of the elders introduced a Land Bill. It provided that instead of giving thirty acres to the islanders as a marriage gift twelve and a-half acres should be given. It was found necessary to propose this as the population was increasing, and, of course, the land was not. That measure' passed through all its stages, and being in favour of small holdings I at once put on my hat and gave the Royal Assent to that Bill. Up to the year 1896 that was the law of the land. But I do say that he would be a bold man who would argue that because the Referendum is a success in Norfolk Island, or in the Swiss Cantons, it would ipso facto be a success in England. The noble Marquess himself expressed great doubt on that subject. And although the noble Lord opposite, in his admirable speech in introducing the Bill, said, quoting a Swiss writer, M. Curti, that absolute peace and majestic calm prevailed over the whole of Switzerland during a Referendum, I have the doubt which was expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, on the First Reading of this Bill, whether peace would be so absolute or the calm so majestic were a Referendum on Home Rule announced in Belfast or Portadawn.<lb/>
I should like the House to consider one question. Why should there be from the Conservative side this desperate attack on our representative system? The reason has been given this evening. The noble Lord opposite said that it was on account of our Parliament Bill. We have been told over and over again until people are beginning to believe it&#x2014;and it has been repeated to-day&#x2014;that the Parliament Bill means single-Chamber government. I am not going to say a wont about our Bill. We shall be perfectly ready and able to defend it when the time comes. But may I say, in passing, that if we wanted single-Chamber government we should have asked for it. What
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0374"/>
<col>697</col>
we ask for is fair play. We ask for equality of treatment; that we should be treated exactly in the same way as noble Lords treat a Conservative majority. There are two reasons&#x2014;two very good reasons&#x2014;why we did not ask for single-Chamber government. The first is, and it is well known, that without exception every single member of the present Government is a bi-cameral man, is in favour of two Chambers. The second reason, and it is unanswerable, is that, even if we wished for a single Chamber, the country was absolutely tired to death of twenty years of single-Chamber government under the great Conservative Party; and if we had tried to bring in a Bill that really meant a single Chamber, we should have been washed by the wave of public opinion high and dry on to the seats of the scornful opposite, and the noble Marquess would have had for the next ten years a Government of all the talents in this House and in the Commons House of Parliament.<lb/>
The real reason for these extraordinary proposals of noble Lords opposite is that we are now suffering from the inevitable reaction caused by your former too highhanded action towards the Liberal Party, and the strain which you have put on your great and almost omnipotent powers. You tied the broom to the masthead in 1906, 1907, and 1908, and attempted to sweep us from the sea and blow us out of the water. You succeeded in that. But in 1909 you went too far. You rejected our Budget, and discovered when it was too late that not only had von come into conflict with the Liberal Party as a party, but with the country, and for the first time the words were heard, Peers <i>versus</i> People. In 1909 you declared war upon us in the most proper and correct way, and the House of Lords sailed into action to demolish the Liberal Party like a very fine fleet of stately war vessels, but unfortunately you were armed with old-fashioned guns and culverins which had not been discharged for over 200 years. What was the result? On the very first broadside a great many of those guns exploded at the muzzle and in the breech and did more damage on board than against the enemy. You fought, as you always do, gallantly and well, but after a fortnight's fight you were defeated and had to sail away discomfited and disappear in the offing&#x2014;whatever or wherever that may be&#x2014;to refit and to take counsel for the future. Then after a sad inte<ob/>lude, to
<col>698</col>
which I need not refer, with a truce of God between the Parties, the Tory fleet reappeared ready and eager for the fight, which Mr. Balfour himself said could not be too long delayed. But it seems to me that you were fighting then under even worse circumstances. Acting on the advice of an ex-Liberal Admiralissimo, you took most of the heart out of your followers by telling them that if it came off as you wished this would be the very last time that they, as the present House of Lords, would go into action as a fighting unit, because the proposal was that two-thirds of their number had been supposed to be, though I do not for one moment, believe it, unable to perform their hereditary duties. Therefore, these fighting men&#x2014;and you have got some splendid fighting material on your side of the House&#x2014;were told that if they won the battle two-thirds of them would walk the plank and be thrown overboard. Well, that seems enough to take the heart out of any body of fighting men.<lb/>
But you went further. On the eve of the battle Mr. Balfour announced at the Albert Hall his policy of the Referendum, of which a great leader of the Conservative Party&#x2014;I won't mention his name because it sometimes makes bad blood&#x2014;has said that if it was introduced as a buttress to the House of Lords it would end by destroying the House of Commons. Well, perhaps that is the object of some Conservatives. I have no idea whether it is true or not. Of course, I do not know anything about that. Mr. Balfour announced to his best fighting legions&#x2014;the people who represented to him what the Swiss Guards were to Marie Antoinette&#x2014;he announced to the men who were fighting for Tariff Reform and for Imperial Preference, which, of course, included the taxation of food&#x2014;he announced to his best troops that their proposals would not be adopted until submitted to the Referendum. I was not present at the Albert Hall meeting, but a friend of mine who is a member of the House of Commons and who was returned by an enormous majority told me that when this unexpected announcement was made the huge audience sat absolutely silent and almost stupified, until some fuglemen, who had been cleverly placed in different parts of the hall, screamed out, "This has won the election." Well, that broke the spell. The vast audience then caught their wind; they cheered, again and again; and, as I believe the Tory Party always do when they are in a tight
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0375"/>
<col>699</col>
place, they all joined hands and sang "Rule Britannia" over and over again. Next day the Tory papers were not all enthusiastic as to the wisdom of this great announcement, but said that after all it was the best thing that had ever been done, and that it was a master stroke and a counter stroke of genius on the part of the noble Marquess opposite and of Mr. Arthur Balfour.<lb/>
But I would very respectfully submit that the body politic, like the human frame, can only bear a certain number of strokes, for at last you come to the end of the power of resistance; and in this instance that turned out to be true, because the last stroke was fatal. You were beaten again for the third time, and for the third time the Liberal Party came into office, and, what is much more important, into power as well. Is there really any reason for this gnashing of Tory teeth and vexation of Unionist spirit? We have been in opposition for twenty long years. We know the sorrows of it, but it is a thing that has to be faced, and, of course, every single one of my colleagues on this side makes all allowance for the grievous disappointment at the non-fulfilment of the most honourable and not unnatural hope of holding office during the Coronation year, and being able to take direction of the Imperial Conference. But the inevitable must be faced. The country has spoken with no uncertain voice and knows what it wants and why it wants it. The country is determined to restore the balance of the Constitution and to see fair play between the two Parties in the State. It is perfectly true, and we recognise it in the Preamble of the Parliament Bill, that the country is not absolutely satisfied with the state of the House of Lords as it at present exists, but there is not the smallest doubt that it has no intention at this stage to re-constitute your Lordships' House. What it intends to do is to put a limit on the absolute, omnipotent, irresponsible, and uncontrolled powers of your Lordships' House, which, I regret to say, have, perhaps not so very long ago, been strained beyond their utmost limits. In spite of all that has been said or may be said to the contrary the country knows that the State is safe and solvent in the hands of the Liberal Government, that we want to take no unfair advantage of the Party opposite because the sun happens to be at the present moment shining on our side of the hedge; and our brethren from the Britains beyond
<col>700</col>
the Seas who are hurrying home now to take part in the great commemoration of the Coronation of His Majesty King George V know that there is no fear of any dangerous Constitutional interference with the integrity of the. Empire or the welfare of the old Mother Country to which we all belong and which we love so well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01475"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I came down to the House this afternoon with the idea of hearing a discussion on the Bill of Lord Balfour of Burleigh, and I am sure the noble Earl who has just spoken will not consider it an impertinence on my part if I do not follow his speech, which has ranged in such a diverting manner over so many subjects. I was one of those who supported the Referendum at the General Election, but since I have had time to study the proposal I am not quite so sure that. I am as much in love with it as I was. [Several NOBLE LORDS: Hear, hear.] Wait a moment, my Lords. I say I am not so much in love with it as I was a month or two ago. We have been attacked in a variety of ways for having introduced what is, perhaps, a new idea into the British Constitution. It has been described as a Tory dodge, and it has been said that we are really the disciples of Rousseau. I should like to remind those noble Lords who were so ready to cheer just now, that our patronage of Jean Jacques Rousseau synchronises with their own adoption for the first time of the principles of Bolingbroke and Beaconsfield. I do not know that I have enjoyed anything so much as listening to the speech of the noble Viscount opposite, a speech full of the noblest and finest Tory sentiments, and in itself a splendid vindication of that very Constitution that he and his friends are about to destroy as soon as they get a reasonable opportunity.<lb/>
I welcome the introduction of this Bill because it will give us an opportunity of discussing the question of the Referendum, and I am very much obliged to the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House for expressing the hope that there will be a full discussion, and that we shall not come to any conclusion in the hurried spirit which was rather displayed on the hustings. No doubt the idea of the Referendum is exceedingly fascinating. Lord Balfour of Burleigh says that the object of government is that the will of the people should prevail.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0376"/>
<col>701</col>
All you have to do is to appeal to the people in their millions; you get the vote of the majority, and, having done a simple sum in addition, you have then solved the problem. I am never quite sure what people mean when they talk of the "will of the people." It can, at best, only mean the will of the majority of the people, and I will frankly confess that I belong to a Party which in the past has always asserted&#x2014;I believe noble Lords and the people themselves would agree&#x2014;that the true object of government is the social welfare of the people, and that the means of obtaining that social welfare are not necessarily always expressed by a bare majority of the people at the moment.<lb/>
I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, said in one of those splendid speeches which he made I think in 1909, that the best work in most States had been the work of aristocracy. In saying that we do not mean, and I am sure the noble Lord did not mean, aristocracy of Party, but aristocracy of brains, of talent, and of patriotism. And I think Sir. Erskine May reminds us with great force, with regard to Constitutional government, that all the best work has been the work of minorities, and that half the introductions into the State of new ideas based upon the health and the welfare of the people would probably have been defeated had they been left to the will of the majority for the time being. As Lord Balfour said just now, there is no doubt whatever that the idea of the Referendum is an exceedingly easy one to defend on the platform. A Scottish Member of Parliament put it to me not very long ago that he supported the Referendum on the platform because he believed it was the only way in which a Scottish Radical could be got to vote for the Tory Party. He was not very successful, however, in that at the last General Election.<lb/>
I do not propose to weary your Lordships with a lecture or a long speech on the Referendum. I have endeavoured to study it to the best of my ability, and I find there are four kinds of Referendum. There is the Referendum for ascertaining the views of the electorate generally about any abstract proposition which has not yet been put into legislative form; the Referendum to defeat or to sanction Bills already passed by both Houses of Parliament; the Referendum to solve deadlocks
<col>702</col>
between the two Houses; and the Referendum by initiative. Under this Bill Lord Balfour of Burleigh proposes to adopt the Referendum for the solving of deadlocks and in the case of Bills on which both branches of the Legislature have already agreed. It is a considerable step to try and graft two Referenda straight away on to the Constitution. We have been told, not so much in this House this evening but in speeches in the country, that, after all, we need not be frightened, because the Referendum works well in other countries. I was glad to hear the noble Marquess support the opinion that analogies drawn from foreign countries are, to a considerable extent, fallacious in considering the Referendum in this country. In other countries where there is this principle of the Referendum there is a written Constitution which enables distinction between Constitutional and other questions. That applies in those countries where there is no Party system, as in Switzerland, where they revel in the luxury of having a permanent Radical majority in both Houses of Parliament, where the Referendum is of very ancient growth, and where direct legislation by the people is part and parcel of their system. Time does not permit me to say anything about the working of the Referendum in Australia or in America, except to refer, for the benefit of those who desire to favour the Referendum because of what it has done in America, to a rather remarkable sentence in Mr. Bryce's appreciation of the Referendum. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"It is very much to be doubted whether the experience of practical working in America has yet been long enough to enable full and final judgment to be passed on its utility."</quote>
As we have heard and read so much about Switzerland, I hope I shall not be wearying your Lordships if I say a word about the way in which the Referendum works there, and the manner in which people either support or oppose a particular measure at the Referendum, because I imagine that human nature is in some respects pretty much the same there as it would be in any other country. I am told that in Switzerland under the Referendum they have a very good system which has generally resulted in the passing of good laws. I do not doubt that for a moment. It would be a great insult to the Swiss Legislature to say they have done otherwise. Many of those who advocate the Referendum tell you that the Referendum is all
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0377"/>
<col>703</col>
right because in Switzerland, where they have the Referendum, Conservative measures have generally been passed and violent and extreme measures have been rejected. That is a great recommendation, and there is no doubt that in Switzerland extreme Radicals, Freethinkers, Socialists, and those who indulge too much in an illegitimate manner both in the sale and consumption of schnapps and absinthe, have been defeated by the common sense of the Swiss people. But at the same time the ideas of the Swiss people with regard to the Referendum have not been nearly so Conservative as a great many people imagine, because in the Canton of Vaud an enterprising Radical started and carried, I think by the initiative Referendum, a system for the progressive taxation of capital of a very extreme kind, with the result that a great deal of capital was frightened out of the country and the Canton suffered accordingly. This particular instance is always quoted in Socialistic newspapers in this country, some of which are rather nibbling at the Referendum, as to what might happen at some future time if you once got the Referendum thoroughly grafted into the legislative system of this country.<lb/>
There is another curious thing about the Referendum in S witzerland&#x2014;namelv, the smallness of the number who go to record their votes. In the Canton of Berne only forty-three per cent. voted on a measure submitted to the Referendum, whereas sixty-three per cent. voted at elections to the Legislature. In the Canton of Zurich a great many people vote at the Referendum, but that is accounted for by the fact that an elector is there fined if he does not record his vote. One legislator said that not only should the people who did not vote be fined, but that those who voted should be paid for having done so&#x2014;I think a franc. The result has been that a lot of people who would rather not pay the two francs or whatever the fine is for not voting at the Referendum, go into the voting room and drop a blank paper into the box. At the same time all the big measures covering a period of five years bad to be abandoned altogether, because a sufficient number of electors to make them into law could not be found. They declined to take a part in the Referendum. There is this other rather remarkable thing about the national Referendum, that generally less than sixty per cent. of those qualified vote.
<col>704</col>
This means that people who do not understand Bills do not go to vote upon them, or a good many ignorant people vote as they are instructed by the agitator. Though we are told that the Swiss people would not get rid of the Referendum if it were ever so, we cannot possibly get away from the remarkable statement made not very long ago by a leading Statesman in Switzerland, who probably knows more about Swiss politics than anybody else. M. Droz tells us that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Referendum has given birth to a camarilla of politicans who exploit the credulity or passions of the populace in order to oppose measures which are perfectly legitimate."</quote>
There is one other form of Referendum which has not been mentioned in Lord Balfour's Bill but which is often alluded to in general conversation. It is said that the Legislature should discover from the people themselves before a proposition is given legislative form whether they are in favour of it. A great many people say this sort of thing: Why not put National Service or Woman Suffrage to the Referendum, and thus find out whether there is a majority of people in favour of either of them? Personally I do not favour this kind of Referendum. In the first place, if the Referendum went against National Service, I, as a member of the National Service League, would work all the harder to get a majority, so that would not be likely to settle the matter. And if we know anything of those who take part in the agitation for votes for women, they would not be likely to give it up on account of the Referendum having gone against them. They would say that it was taken by people who understood nothing about the question&#x2014;meaning the opposite sex&#x2014;and they would not attach any value to the majority. But to my mind there is in this form of Referendum something worse than that. It is that this sort of Referendum is suggested very often by the very people who themselves ought to be leaders of public opinion, and a great many people suggest it in order that they may be saved the trouble of speaking out and leading their fellow citizens upon any important subject. I will quote M. Droz again. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"Fear of Referendum makes timid legislators, who sometimes lack the courage to vote for what they believe to be the best for the country, or, having voted for it, to stand up for it before their fellow-citizens."</quote>
I cannot discover from the speech of my noble friend exactly what kind of measure he proposes to put to the Referendum, but
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0378"/>
<col>705</col>
he said that in trying: to separate these matters a serious and formidable difficulty is encountered. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition said, with great truth, that most electors would have a good rough-and-read y notion whether they approved a particular Bill or not. I have no doubt that is so, and that in process of time you may educate the people of this country to become judges of Bills, but at present that is not the way in which they expect to have their legislation carried on. A number of the electors in this country have never seen a Bill, and many of the people in the place where I live would not see a Bill submitted to the country under the Referendum because to do so they would have to walk twelve miles to the office of the Clerk of the Peace, where suppose would be lodged the only available copy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01476"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The object of that proposal is to provide a definite and concise form from which organs of public opinion can quote for the information of the people. It is not necessary for every one to inspect the precise form in which the Bill is put before the people, but a copy is to be deposited in the office of the Clerk of the Peace for inspection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01477"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: The reason I lay some slight stress on this point is that in Switzerland the Legislature sends round a copy of the Bill to every single elector, so that they are quite sure he will have some chance of being able to form an opinion upon it. The Referendum if introduced into this country may be all right in order to settle questions which cannot be settled in any other way. If we could get some guarantee that it would only be used on very important occasions, I for one would support the Referendum in that respect; but there must be the most careful safeguards and guarantees that it is not going to be allowed to creep into and permeate the whole of our political system, in the way it has done in the political systems of other countries where it has been adopted. Many people compare Switzerland and England without having the slightest idea of the extraordinarily marked difference between the whole thought and tendency of the two peoples. In Switzerland there is Ito personal element whatever in the elections. In the year 1884 the people themselves voted down
<col>706</col>
the four most important Bills that had been passed in the session of the Swiss Council, yet in spite of that they returned the same members to office. That is not the way in which the people of this country have been accustomed to manage their affairs. They vote&#x2014;as I think the noble Lord reminded us on one occasion&#x2014;not for one measure or another, but in turn for one set of men or for another. That is a habit which I believe it will be very difficult to uproot. For once one feels inclined to agree with an able writer in the <i>Clarion</i>, who says&#x2014;
<quote>"It is the business of real Statesmen to lead, not to follow, the people&#x2026; The bulk of the English people are not politicians. They like to choose rulers and let them rule."</quote>
And so long as rulers do not produce anything organic or anything extreme, the people of this country are willing to allow them to dictate the general tenor of the measures which they produce. But we have to pay the penalty of this form of representative government in this country. We are paying the penalty at this very moment by having a Government in office who cart only keep their various groups together by proposing an organic and extreme method of dealing with the Constitutional problem.<lb/>
The Tory mind I should have thought might be allowed to object to the Referendum as much as ever it liked, but I cannot understand the mind of noble Lords opposite and their friends in really objecting to the Referendum. The first thing that I should have thought they would have welcomed it for is that it concedes something to the idea which they approve but of which. I disapprove, that plural voting should be given up. That is what our friends opposite are always so anxious to see consummated. The principle of plural voting will, to a great extent, be destroyed by the Referendum. I have been brought up to think, and always shall think, that plural voting is a perfectly sound and desirable thing in this country. I shall be sorry to see any Bill passed into law which gives colour to the idea that we have abandoned tie principle of plural voting. Radical speakers are never tired of talking about the voice of the people, but it seems that they will do anything in the world except go to the people and consult them about any specific measure they happen to have on their programme. The Prime Minister said at Bury St.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0379"/>
<col>707</col>
Edmunds in December that he did not want the Referendum at all as it was only mutilating the functions of Parliament, but he proclaimed, amid loud cheers, that if anybody wanted the Referendum he could not have a better Referendum than the one they were having then at the General Election. The electors of Bury St. Edmunds took him at his word and returned a Conservative Member. But that is neither here nor there.<lb/>
The Prime Minister claimed the last General Election as a specific Referendum upon the House of Lords question and upon nothing else, but since then the same Referendum has had to do duty for several other things. If the will of the people was expressed at the last General Election in favour of Home Rule and the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales as well as upon the House of Lords question, I cannot see what objection the Prime Minister and his friends can possibly have to placing these measures before the people themselves for a direct vote. I agree with the theory which the noble Viscount has always put forward in this House, that there is not at any General Election a specific mandate for any particular measure. But, however that may be, we say that there is no mandate whatever residing in the present Parliament for the destruction of the Constitution by straining the Royal Prerogative in the way proposed. I confess frankly that I view with great suspicion
<col>708</col>
the introduction of the principle of the. Referendum into the politics of this country, but I would sooner&#x2014;and I think the country would far sooner&#x2014;see any single issue put to the Referendum than that the far more drastic and revolutionary proposals of the Government should be adopted. If I interpret the noble Marquess rightly, we are contending for the principle that the people shall not have things thrust upon them on which they have not in reality been consulted, and that is a principle which we do not intend to abandon. I cannot see that it is such a fantastic notion either. The project in the Parliament Bill is a great deal more fantastic, and, as I say, a great deal more revolutionary. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture said that if the Government had wanted single-Chamber government they would have asked for it. I do not believe that they dare go to the country and ask for single-Chamber government. But they are doing something which is infinitely more discreditable&#x2014;I use the word in a political and not in an offensive sense&#x2014;in that they are trying to pass what is in effect single-Chamber government under the guise of preserving the double-Chamber system.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE BILL.<lb/>[H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01501">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01502"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it will be generally agreed that the argument in support of the Bill now before your Lordships which has had most influence not only amongst your Lordships but also amongst the people of this country is the argument that, because the Referendum has been a success in other parts of the world, therefore it is likely to be a success in this country. That was the line of argument adopted by Lord Tennyson, who was at one time Governor of Australia, and who, on the First Reading, spoke with some personal knowledge of the subject. It was also, as a matter of personal experience, mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, who whilst in South Africa had seen something of its action there; and it was also, I think, one of the main points urged on the First Reading by the noble Lord who introduced the Bill. The noble Lord made so much point of it that I shall venture to remind your Lordships of the form in which he pressed that argument. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"This system is in operation in Switzerland and in some of the American States and in some of our Dominions across the sea. I do not press these analogies too far. I am quite aware that there are differences not only in the Constitutional form of the Governments of those countries as compared with our own, but in their customs and circumstances; but I am entitled to make this point, that wherever it has been tried it has been successful and that no one in any country in which it is now part of the Constitution proposes to abandon it."</quote>
In the course of the remarks which I shall address to your Lordships this evening I am anxious, by reference to the various occasions upon which the Referendum has been used, not only in our Dominions but also in other parts of the world, to show that there is no instance to which the noble Lord can point of the use of the Referendum which can fairly be quoted as an argument in support of this Bill.<lb/>
With regard to Switzerland, it is, happily, unnecessary for me to say very much to your Lordships. That matter was very fully, and, it seemed to me, admirably dealt with by Lord Willoughby de Broke last night at an hour when the Benches of the House were less fully occupied than they are at the present moment.<lb/>
<col>712</col>
I was sorry, because although the noble Lord concluded by saying that he was in favour of the Referendum, his arguments one and all seemed to point to the fact that it would not be wise to adopt this Swiss system because our system in this country was so very different. I would point out to your Lordships the very important fact that although the Referendum exists in Switzerland the people of that country make very small use of it indeed, though there are three categories into which Referenda can be divided&#x2014;subjects which must be referred, subjects which may be referred, and subjects which come to the Referendum under popular initiative. It will interest Lord Courtney to know that in Switzerland the system of proportional representation was refused under the Referendum, and the noble Lord who spoke last yesterday evening made very fair reference to the fact that so few people vote in the Referendum in Switzerland that in some of the Cantons it has been found necessary to inflict a fine upon those who do not record their vote.<lb/>
There is one point to which I hope some of those noble Lords on the Government Benches who are in favour of the Referendum may direct their attention. We are told that it is a democratic system, and that therefore His Majesty's Government should be heartily in support of it. But I ask whether experience has proved that it is a progressive measure as well as a pseudo-democratic measure. A good many subjects referred in this way to the people of the country are not subjects upon which it is very easy for them to take a wholly scientific view. I have in mind such a question as vaccination. It is not difficult for a scientist to persuade an assembly of representative men such as the House of Commons of the value of vaccination, but when vaccination was referred to the people of Switzerland it was rejected in 1882 by a vast majority, and it seems to me that there does lie in that direction some danger lest in matters of this kind, which require a certain amount of technical training, reference to the people of this country will find them less prepared to adopt a new idea than the House of Commons. In Switzerland there is no Party system. The members elected to their Assembly are not as our members, of one Party or another. They are rather in the position of elected administrators&#x2014;Civil servants rather than representatives
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0382"/>
<col>713</col>
and the Bill which is referred to the people is an agreed Bill; no Budget is subject to the Referendum at all.<lb/>
Then as to the United States of America. The noble Earl the Lord Privy Seal spoke for some time upon that subject on the occasion of the First Reading, and it is not necessary for me to say much now, except to point out to the noble Lord that if lie is anxious to use the United States of America as an analogy it would be fairer to ask us to adopt something more like their system than the system which he proposes in this Bill. There is no general system of Referendum in the United States. It is used only in the States, and not throughout the whole of the Federation. Therefore it would be a fairer analogy in this country to ask Wales to vote upon such a question as the Disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales, Ireland to vote on Home Rule, and Scotland on their Land Bill. It is only by such a system that you really get an analogy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01503"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Earl suggest that Home Rule interests only Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01504"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I do not suggest that. At the same time if the noble Lord is going to use America as an argument, I do not think it is unfair to point out that the Referendum in the United States is kept within a smaller area and is not used throughout the whole Federation. Your Lordships have heard the figures relating to Switzerland. I will give some interesting figures later dealing with Australia. But it is important first that we should know how large a number of people in this country vote at a General Election. At the election in January,1910, 90 per cent. of the electors on the roll voted, and it is more democratic to get 90 per cent. of the people to record their opinion at the General Election than under a system of Referendum to get less than 50 per cent.; and the municipal polls in this country show that it is very difficult indeed to get the electors, although their pockets are directly affected, to take sufficient interest in these matters to go to the polls. I always thought that the old school board system, with election <i>ad hoc</i>, was an admirable system, and calculated to interest people in the educational system of this country, but it also did seem to me that
<col>714</col>
the strongest argument against the election of a school board <i>ad hoc</i> was the fact that the ratepayers did not come in very large numbers to such an election. Indeed there seemed to be a tendency to tire the voters by giving them too many things to vote about, and it was not altogether unwise to alter the system. The figures with regard to the five cases which I have been able to get from the Local Government Board of polls taken under the Borough Funds Act; are instructive. In the case of Bicester 18&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the voters recorded their votes; in the case of Paddington, 16&#x00B7;5 per cent.; in the case of Exmouth, 68 per cent.; in the case of Little Hulton, 50&#x00B7;2 per cent.; and in the case of Llanelly, 24&#x00B7;2 per cent. Those polls did not refer to any matter of great importance except to those people who were asked to vote, and yet under these circumstances they were not found very ready to go to the poll.<lb/>
Let us turn to the Dominions beyond the seas and see what assistance can be found to help us in discussing the merits and the demerits of this Bill. The Referendum has been used on the whole very little in our Dominions for any purpose whatever. I shall venture; for the sake of clearness, to classify the instances of its use and put them into three classes. I will deal first with the cases of great Constitutional changes&#x2014;namely, the formation of the Federation of Australia and the Union of South Africa. I may remind your Lordships, in passing, that in the case of the formation of the Federation of Canada there was no Referendum at all; in only one instance was a General Election held, and the assent of the Parliaments was considered sufficient authority for the formation of the Union of the Provinces and the abandonment by the Provinces of their autonomy.<lb/>
In the case of Australia, on the other hand, the greatest care was taken to secure the fullest consultation of the people. It was agreed at a Conference of Premiers held in January, 1895, that a Federal Constitution should be framed by a Convention which was to be popularly elected, and that when that Convention bad conic to a decision Bills should be submitted to the Parliaments of each of the Colonies to give effect to those Resolutions. Bills were so submitted and were passed, but the proportion of people who voted was
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0383"/>
<col>715</col>
very small indeed. The percentages of the electors voting in the several Colonies when this great question of the Federation of Australia was brought up were: Victoria, 43&#x00B7;5 per cent.; New South. Wales, 51&#x00B7;25 per cent.; South Australia, 30&#x00B7;9 per cent.; Tasmania, 25 per cent. Then the terms of the Constitution were drawn up and referred to the people of Australia, and we find that even then a very small proportion of the people voted. I venture to say that it is very remarkable indeed that on a matter of such great importance as the Federation of the various Colonies you should find such a small percentage as this being content to go to the poll&#x2014;namely: in New South Wales, 49&#x00B7;88 per cent.; in Victoria, 48&#x00B7;94 per cent.; in Tasmania, 46&#x00B7;5 per cent.; and in South Australia, 39&#x00B7;44 per cent. Those of your Lordships who are familiar with the rather remarkable history of the Federation of Australia will remember that there was a further Conference of the Premiers because New South Wales had not reached the requisite 80,000 votes, and after that Conference, the Bill having been altered, the matter was once more referred to the people of Australia, and on that occasion there was the highest percentage of votes that has ever been cast on a similar occasion&#x2014;namely: New South Wales, 63&#x00B7;4 per cent.; Victoria, 56&#x00B7;3 per cent.; South Australia, 54&#x00B7;4 per cent.; Tasmania, 36&#x00B7;5 per cent.; Queensland, 64&#x00B7;8 per cent.; and Western Australia, 67&#x00B7;1 per cent. I venture to say that in all these cases of the use of the Referendum the proportion of voters compares very badly indeed with the number of people who go to the poll at a General Election in this country.<lb/>
In the case of the Union of South Africa we find that the older precedent of Canada was followed except in the case of Natal, to which the noble Earl who was lately High Commissioner referred on the occasion of the First Reading of this Bill. But even there we find that the percentage of people who voted in Natal was only 58&#x00B7;2, although there was a great deal of excitement in the Colony and people were urged to record their vote. It is not too much, I think, to deduce from these figures the conclusion that people dislike coming in large numbers to a Referendum, and that certainly unless there is the excitement which attaches to a vivid personality people are less likely to vote than at a
<col>716</col>
General Election. So much for the first case, which has reference to the formation of great Constitutions.<lb/>
The second category consists of alterations of Constitutions. The ordinary Dominion has full power to alter its Constitution, subject in certain cases to some formalities. This principle, however, obviously cannot be applied to cases of a Federation proper. A Federation is, generally speaking, a <i>quasi</i> Treaty between the various States who enter into the Federation, and any alteration of the Constitution demands a good deal of ceremony and must be carefully guarded with restrictions. In the case of Canada, so strongly is this recognised that the Constitution as a whole, and in particular the distribution of powers between the Provinces and the Dominion, cannot be altered except by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. They have no Referendum but are content with the one possibility of an alteration being made by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. In the case of the Commonwealth of Australia the makers of the Constitution are anxious themselves to be able to alter the Constitution, and they provide that in any case of an alteration of the Constitution there should be a Referendum to the people. But it is important to notice that they do not in Australia, generally speaking, apply the Referendum as the noble Lord who has introduced this Bill desires to apply it. They do not apply it in cases of deadlock between the two Houses, except in connection with a Constitutional Amendment; that makes a very great difference between the system as proposed in this Bill and the experience which we can gather from Australia. The Dominions beyond the seas do not use it for the purposes for which the noble Lord makes use of it in his Bill. In any case of a Constitutional Amendment, whether approved of or not by both Houses of Parliament, it has to be referred to the people as a whole.<lb/>
Let me give the instances that have occurred of a Referendum taken under such circumstances. There have been two or three. The first occasion was in 1906, when a Referendum was taken contemporaneously with a General Election to the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth. The question which was submitted was an extraordinarily trivial one. Up till then a Senator's period of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0384"/>
<col>717</col>
office had always begun on January 1 or July 1&#x2014;I have forgotten which&#x2014;but it was thought more convenient that the period of office should open on the other date, and the whole process of a Referendum was necessary in order to secure that trifling alteration in the law. There was a large majority in favour of the change. The figures were for the whole Commonwealth: For, 774,011; against, 162,470; but no fewer than 112,155 ballot papers&#x2014;more than 9 per cent.&#x2014;were spoiled. Then in April of last year, contemporaneously with the General Election, two Referenda were taken on important questions. The first was to alter the Constitution so as to enable the Commonwealth to take over all the debts of the Constitution as existing at the time when they were taken over and not merely the debts as they existed at the time of the passing of the Constitution. On that occasion the percentage of voters was 57, although the Referendum took place at the same time as a General Election; and your Lordships will, of course, understand that you are far more likely to get people to vote at the same time as a General Election than if there is not that excitement going on at the same time.<lb/>
The other proposal was a readjustment of the Commonwealth and the State finances. The total vote in favour of the law was 645,514; against, 670,838; and 82,437 papers were informal. The percentage of voters to the total number of electors enrolled was fifty-eight. It was not carried as a Constitutional Amendment, but in spite of that it became law within the next session of Parliament; and I ask the noble Lord whether he does not think that in these circumstances it may be necessary for him, if this Bill is allowed to proceed farther, to insert some provision which may prevent a measure which has been voted against by the people becoming law within a certain limited period of time. I am sure Lord Northcote, who has been Governor of Australia, appreciates the point that though it was rejected by the people of Australia as an Amendment to the Constitution it was passed as a general law and it was passed, I think, by a Labour Ministry. But in spite of that it does seem to me a very remarkable result of the Referendum that a proposal rejected at the Referendum shall become law within a year or within a very short time after-
<col>718</col>
wards. It is interesting, too, in this way, that it shows a certain unwillingness on the part of the Labour Party, with whom democratic measures are popular, to accept as desirable the making permanent and changeable only by the Referendum of any financial provisions; and their attitude is the more noteworthy because with the Labour Party the Referendum is a very prominent plank in their platform. I may add that in April of this year two very important Bills will be submitted to the Referendum by the Commonwealth Government quite apart from a General Election, and I am sure it will be interesting to all of us to notice what proportion of the people can be persuaded to go to the poll apart from the excitement of a General Election.<lb/>
Now I come to the third category&#x2014;definite cases when Parliament has referred questions to the people. Those are generally cases in which Parliament has preferred not to express an opinion of its own, but has definitely asked the people to decide the question for them. The first reference of this kind to Referendum was in South Australia in the year 1896. At that time the system of education was secular, and. those who were in favour of religious education thought that the introduction of female suffrage was a favourable opportunity to bring their proposals once more before the people of South Australia, and therefore the electors were asked three questions. They were asked, first, whether they desired the continuance of the existing system. In favour of continuing the existing system 51,744 voted, and 17,755 against. Secondly, they were asked whether they desired the introduction of undenominational scriptural instruction in school hours; 18,889 voted for, and 34,922 against. Finally, they were asked whether they were prepared to approve of State capitation grants to denominational schools for secular results; 13,420 voted for, and 41,975 against.. Those figures are a very interesting study. It is difficult without a good deal of knowledge of the local circumstances to draw any very definite conclusions from them except this, that a great deal must depend upon the shape in which questions are put to the people, and their answers must very largely depend upon the form in which the questions are put.<lb/>
Let me turn to a somewhat similar instance of a reference to the people of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0385"/>

Canada. There had been in various States a movement in favour of the prohibition of liquor. It was found, however, that although the results were in favour of prohibition, a general law affecting the whole of Canada was the only way in which they could carry out their proposals. Accordingly a Referendum of the whole of Canada was taken under the Act of 1898, and the result was a majority of some 14,000 for prohibition out of a total vote of 543,049. No more than 23 per cent. of the electorate were in favour of a prohibitory law, and therefore, although you had a majority upon Referendum in favour of action of this kind, Sir Wilfrid Laurier stated in the Canadian House of Commons on March 21, 1899, that in his opinion the voice of the electorate as expressed was not such as to warrant the Government in introducing a prohibitory measure, and he indicated that unless at least one-half of the electorate recorded their votes in favour of the policy it would not be possible to expect Parliament to pass a prohibitory measure; and since that time nothing has been done.<lb/>
Then there is the case which was referred to by Lord Tennyson on the First Reading of this Bill&#x2014;the case of Queensland, where again there was a reference on the question of religious instruction in the schools. This action is interesting. At the Referendum the people voted in favour of religious instruction being given in the schools, and you had this curious result, that in the next session of Parliament the Premier for the time being introduced a measure to that effect, but said that he was hostile to it, and he and other Members of Parliament who voted in favour of the Bill said that although they voted for it they were entirely opposed to the principle, but that they supported it because it had been carried by a Referendum. I do not think it would be in accord with the traditions of our public life that members of the Government here in this country should introduce into either House of Parliament and carry a measure of which they declared themselves to be opponents. I do not deny that there seems to be a growing use of the Referendum in certain of our Dominions. There will be before very long, also at the same moment as a General Election, a Referendum taken in the Dominion of New Zealand upon the question of total prohibition. That, I think, takes place in the course of next
<col>720</col>
month, and if three-fifths are in favour of total prohibition the measure will forthwith be passed through both Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
I now turn to a perhaps more important question&#x2014;the use of the Referendum in cases of deadlock. As your Lordships may have perceived, no instances have yet occurred in which the difference of opinion between the two Houses has been settled by the Referendum. Provisions for settling such differences in this way form no part of the ordinary Colonial Constitution. South Africa definitely rejected it; Canada has no provision of the kind; and in Australia, though the Referendum may be used in eases of Constitutional Amendment, it is not used in cases of ordinary deadlock. There is that exception, the Constitutional alteration of the Commonwealth, and also the one isolated instance of deadlock which might take place in Queensland. The provision which has been made by these wise Statesmen, with the experience of the world before them, has been that in ordinary cases of deadlock there should be joint sittings of both Houses rather than a Referendum to the people; and I would spend, with your Lordships' permission, some little time in dealing with this special case of Queensland, because in it is also involved a question of, I hope, merely academic interest&#x2014;the swamping of the Upper House of Legislature. In 1907 the Governor of Queensland, Lord Chelmsford, refused to add members to the Upper House at the request of Mr. Kidston, who was then Prime Minister, and who was anxious to secure enough supporters in the Upper House to pass two particular Bills. The Governor refused him the creation of these members, and he forthwith resigned. Mr. Philp took office on the resignation of Mr. Kidston, but he was refused a Vote of Supply by the House of Assembly, and, finding himself unable to carry on the Government, the Governor granted him a Dissolution.<lb/>
But at the Dissolution he was decisively defeated, and the previous Prime Minister, Mr. Kidston, was returned to power. Mr. Kidston, however, was not satisfied with his position, which rested upon coalition, and he therefore proceeded to form a partnership with his former opponent, Mr. Philp. This he did after securing the passage of a couple of Bills, including the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0386"/>
<col>721</col>
Bill for the Removal of Deadlocks. This Act for the removal of deadlocks has not yet been put into force. Whether it ever will be is, of course, doubtful; but I think you will admit that the existence of that Act very materially alters the position of the Upper House in Queensland. Before the passing of that Act it would have been Constitutional and not unusual for the Governor to swamp the Upper House if thought desirable at any time. The thing had been done more than once in New South Wales. I am not sure that my noble friend Lord Carrington did not have the question put to him when he was Governor there; the principle was conceded in 1892 in the case of New Zealand, and it is interesting to note that Dominion Day in New Zealand is fixed on the anniversary of the day on which the Despatch was sent from the Colonial Office in this country approving of the creation of additional members to the Upper House in that Dominion. I think we may say that this review of what has happened shows that there is nowhere in any of His Majesty's Dominions beyond the seas an instance in which we can find that the Referendum is in favour as a method of settling matters of dispute between the two Houses.<lb/>
The Bill now before the House goes a great deal further even than settling Parliamentary deadlocks between the two Houses. There is, as I have said, in the Commonwealth and in Queensland provision for a Referendum in eases of Bills being rejected by the Upper House, but these provisions differ considerably from those in the noble Lord's Bill. In the case of this Bill there is a provision for an artificial majority, which requires that the total affirmative vote in the United Kingdom must exceed the total negative vote by not less than 2 per cent. of the latter vote before a Bill can be presented for the Royal Assent. I would point out to the noble Lord that in all these cases a simple majority suffices. The figures which I have given to your Lordships show that it is rarely that more than 50 per cent. of the electors take part in a Referendum. I do not know whether the noble Lord is prepared to accept a vote carried, so to speak, by a majority of a minority. It is not an inconceivable thing. It is, so far as any experience in the Colonies tells us, not unlikely to happen in this country that so few will go to the poll&#x2014;less than 50 per
<col>722</col>
cent.&#x2014;that through the people not taking. the trouble to vote a measure may be carried by the majority of a minority.<lb/>
There is another part of this Bill which is completely without parallel anywhere in the Dominions, and that is the provision proposed to be made by Clause 2 for the reference to the people of Bills which have been passed by both Houses of Parliament but against which a petition is presented to the Crown signed by not fewer than 200 members of the House of Commons praying that the Bill may be submitted to a poll of the Parliamentary electors. If we may judge at all from the example of what has happened in the Dominions, a minority of the people of this country might thus over-ride a majority in the House of Commons who had been elected with the full concurrence and the full approval of this country. Therefore we come to this conclusion. In Canada opinion seems on all sides completely opposed to measures like the Referendum; it has never been seriously proposed as a solution for deadlocks between the two Houses. South Africa deliberately rejected it as part of her new Constitution. In Australia the Referendum appears quite unable to secure adequate voting on the part of those to whom it is submitted, and the number of spoiled papers has been extremely large in the Australian cases. Thus, even in the case of the Referenda for the establishment of the Commonwealth Government, when the utmost efforts were made to arouse the interest of the electors, the vote was only about 50 per cent. of the possible voters&#x2014;considerably less than the average vote at ordinary Elections. There are no figures available as to the cost of the Referendum apart from a General Election, but in view of the Referenda which are to take place in Australia next month a sum of &#x00A3;40,000 has been set aside. We cannot tell if that will be a sufficient sum or not, but it would not be an extravagant thing, considering the proportions of population, to multiply that and say that a Referendum on those lines in this country would cost something like &#x00A3;200,000. Therefore I venture to say that so far, at any rate, there is no experience in any of our Dominions to show that the Referendum is of use in any cases of deadlock.<lb/>
The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition last night provided us with
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0387"/>
<col>723</col>
,one of those surprises to which we are becoming accustomed on this side of the House. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, has been making speeches about the country in favour of the reform schemes of himself and his friends. They include the Referendum. I am afraid that the noble Earl was insufficiently reported, because it was very difficult from the London Press to find the full effect of his various declarations. But I certainly gather from the speeches which he made in Glasgow and in Edinburgh that he and the Opposition propose in their new scheme to make a very large use of the Referendum in their great. scheme of reform. Last night, however, we learned from the noble Marquess that that would probably not be the case. He seemed to minimise as far as possible the opportunities for the Referendum, and I thought that he answered a speech which was made later in the evening by Lord Willoughby de Broke, who taunted His Majesty's Government with their unwillingness to trust the people. They on their side, he thought, were ready and anxious to trust the people, but it was His Majesty's Government who shrank from that ordeal. We find that, after all, noble Lords opposite do not wish to refer matters to the people of this country or to trust the people at very frequent intervals, but that it is to be used sparingly and on rare occasions.<lb/>
There is one matter which has been the subject of very real regret to most noble Lords on this side of the House in the course of the debates which have taken place on this question, and it is that it seems almost impossible for any noble Lord opposite speaking on the Referendum not to make at the same time an attack on the other House of Parliament. They frequently express their desire not to make an attack on the other House, but almost invariably they are betrayed into doing it before the end of their speech. That was so with the noble Marquess last night, who spoke of correcting the glaring and palpable defects of the other House. So also with the noble Lord who is the author of this Bill. And there is another point which I should like to put to noble Lords opposite, as to whether this Bill will not diminish the powers of your Lordships' House in respect to the compromise and the powers of revision and of amendment which we are anxious that your Lordships' House should possess. What is going to be referred to the people is not the Bill when
<col>724</col>
your Lordships have amended it or altered it; it is going to be the Bill as it left the House of Commons. Let us apply that to the Education Bill of 1906. Your Lordships spent a long time in altering that Bill. No doubt noble Lords opposite thought that it was much improved when it reached the end of Committee stage in this House; but the Bill which, under the noble Lord's proposal, would be submitted to the country would not be the Bill as amended by your Lordships, but the Bill as it left the House of Commons, and therefore the only alternative which would be before the people would be to accept the Bill as it left the House of Commons or to reject it altogether, without allowing them to take advantage of the Amendments which had been inserted in this House.<lb/>
There is one aspect of this question which we welcome cordially from this side, and it is the extent to which the Referendum Bill admits the grievances of which we have complained for some years past. We are very glad, in the first place, that our grievances should be admitted; that the noble Lord should be ready, as I do not think he would have been ready eighteen months ago, to admit that the grievances exist. That is one step in advance. Then there is the matter to which Lord Willoughby de Broke referred last night with regret&#x2014;the fact that plural voting is in theory now thrown over by noble Lords opposite, at any rate by the noble Lord who is responsible for this Bill. And, finally, there is another aspect which I do not think has been much touched upon. It is this, that the real chasm which divides noble Lords opposite from us on this great question is whether the will of the people should prevail within the limits of a single Parliament, or whether your Lordships shall always have the right to refer a matter to a General Election. That has been a claim which I think Constitutional theorists on the other side of the House have always made for noble Lords&#x2014;that they should be able to refer a matter to a General Election for decision by the people. In that matter the noble Lord goes some way because under the Referendum a second General Election would not be necessary. He goes so far as to say that if there is returned to power a Government with the authority of the people of this country behind it, all the turmoil and the expense
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0388"/>
<col>725</col>
and. the disturbance of a General Election is not necessary although your Lordships may not approve of the principle of an important Bill. There would be a power given to the Government to secure the passage into law of a Bill which had the approval of the House of Commons within the limits of a single Parliament, although your Lordships did not approve of the measure. That seems to me again to mark a very distinct advance towards the position of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
There is before us now as a House and as a Government the offer which your Lordships make of Reform and the Referendum. On the other hand, there is the Parliament Bill which has been discussed in two Parliaments, which in the shape of the Parliament Bill received a First Reading and. a good deal of discussion in the course of the last Parliament in another place, and which made a fleeting appearance upon the Table of your Lordships' House at the end of last session. What we say is that at the last two elections the policy of His Majesty's Government was fully before the people of this country. It was particularly before them at the last General Election. So also was your policy of the Referendum <i>plus</i> Reform, or, as I suppose we ought to call it, of Reform <i>plus</i> the Referendum. His Majesty's Government are now bound in honour to themselves and to the country to push forward their proposals and their Parliament Bill, rather than accept your solution which was refused by the people at the last election.<lb/>
And there is this further, and perhaps less controversial, point. What we have to consider is whether the Referendum is a proper development of our Constitution, or whether it is being put on to it as an excrescence from outside having no organic connection with our Constitution naturally. Our opinion, your Lordships will have gathered, is that it is inconsistent with representative government in this country. We have always learned that the invention of representative government was one of the most valuable contributions to modern thought made by the Anglo-Saxon race. We are afraid that by substituting for representative government this device of the Referendum you add on a merely mechanical institution to the government of this country. We do not deny that the matter would be easy to do; but what we say is
<col>726</col>
that it would be wholly different from, and contrary to, the tendency of the Constitution of this country at the present time. In our opinion it would violate the traditions and cut at the very root of the theories which govern the Constitution of this country, and therefore His Majesty's Government will oppose this Bill as far as they possibly can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01505"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there seems to me some apparent contradiction between the line of argument adopted by the noble Viscount yesterday and that adopted in the speech to which we have just listened. If I understood the noble Viscount rightly, he contended yesterday that what had occurred in other countries in connection with the Referendum was of little or no importance. On the other hand, the greater portion of the noble Earl's speech to-day has been directed to showing what had and what had not happened in those countries. I gather that the noble Earl adopted this line of argument under the impression, which I think is erroneous, that our main case rests upon the experience gained in countries where the Referendum has already been put in practice. That impression is erroneous. Casual allusion has, indeed, been made in the course of this debate to the experience of other countries, and it would certainly be unwise to neglect it. I am about, in the course of my remarks, to make further allusion in that direction. But it would be a mistake to suppose that our main case rests upon the experience gained in other countries. Our arguments are based on the present condition of this country, and we want to introduce something which is fitted for this country and for this country alone.<lb/>
There was one passage in the eloquent speech which the noble Viscount addressed to us yesterday which entirely removed any lingering doubts I may have had as to the advisability of applying the system of the Referendum to this country. The noble Viscount gave us an imaginary but very interesting Parliamentary calendar of the future. He contemplated that a Home Rule Bill would be referred to the country in July, 1911, and that it might be rejected. That, I think, is highly probable. He then said that a Unionist Government would come into power, and that after an interval of a year they would refer a Tariff Reform measure to the country. He
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0389"/>
<col>727</col>
contemplated that that; would also be rejected. That is, I daresay, not at all improbable. The noble Viscount drew from these imaginary facts a conclusion very adverse to the adoption of the system of the Referendum. What, however, would be the result if the noble Viscount's political horoscope turned out to be correct? It would be that the country would then have to choose between a Liberal Government purged of Home Rule and a Unionist Government purged of Tariff Reform. My Lords, from the point of view of a Unionist Free Trader, nothing could be better. I believe that this would be a consummation which would be regarded by a very large number of people in this country, not merely with complacency, but. with unmixed satisfaction.<lb/>
My Lords, I think that. we owe a deep debt of gratitude to my noble friend Lord Balfour for introducing this Bill. Whatever may be its ultimate fate it will, at all events, form a convenient means for crystallising public opinion on the subject of the Referendum. This measure, taken in conjunction with the scheme for the reform of this House which will soon be introduced by the noble Marquess, must be regarded as a plan for dealing with the Constitutional crisis alternative to that proposed by His Majesty's Government. Throughout all the turmoil and confusion of recent discussions one point has been very clearly fixed in the minds of a large number of people in this country. It is that whatever solution be adopted it should be one that holds out a reasonable prospect of stability, and one which shall guarantee the country against the inauguration of an era of endless discussion and spasmodic change in the fundamental institutions of the country.<lb/>
The noble Viscount quoted yesterday from the writings of Burke, that great mine of political wisdom. Whilst he was speaking there was another passage in Burke's writings which occurred to my mind, and which, although I have been unable to verify it since, I think I can quote from memory with sufficient accuracy for my purposes. Burke said that it was unwise to make the extreme medicine of the Constitution its daily bread. Now that exactly describes the danger to which the execution of the Government programme exposes us. The plan brought forward by His Majesty's Government is violently resented by an important minority, and is notoriously
<col>728</col>
viewed with great apprehension amongst many in t he ranks of the majority. Can it be supposed that such a programme will be accepted as final? Surely not. The prospect which the Government programme opens up must indeed fill the mind of any sober thinking person who can rise above the Party interest of the day with a feeling little short of dismay. It is a prospect of prolonged and acrimonious discussions on vital Constitutional issues&#x2014;discussions which, whatever be the ultimate result, cannot fail to produce acute discord in our internal, and weakness and vacillation in our external politics. The noble Viscount yesterday alluded to the effect that was being produced abroad by the crisis at home, and I am very glad that he did so, for, although I do not view the subject in the same light as the noble Viscount, I entirely agree that this aspect of the case has not, in the course of these discussions, received nearly the attention it deserves. Every one knows that our proceedings are being watched with great attention by observers on the Continent, and any one who is at all in touch with the views held by Continental Statesmen and diplomatists is aware that an opinion is gradually gaining ground to the effect that we are so torn by dissension on matters of internal policy that our influence as a world Power is, to say the least, greatly diminished. I daresay that the importance of this aspect of the case is exaggerated now, as it was a century ago by Napoleon. I do not doubt that if any serious crisis in foregin affairs occurred, we should in the future, as in the past, be found a united nation. Nevertheless, the mere fact that such an opinion exists is calculated to do harm to British interests, and to weaken that wholesome British influence which, when hacked up by a strong Navy, is one of the best securities for maintaining the peace of the world.<lb/>
It does not appear to me that considerations of this nature afford any reason for rejecting the principle of the Referendum. But they do afford a very strong reason for pausing before the last chance which will occur of coming to a mutual understanding is finally abandoned. I cannot agree with the view expressed by the noble Viscount and others that, because the Conference broke down, all hope of a settlement by mutual agreement should be abandoned. On the contrary, I think that if His Majesty's Government oppose an alsolute <i>non possums</i> to the programme
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0390"/>
<col>729</col>
now put forward by the Opposition, of which this Bill forms an integral part, they will, I venture to think, be accepting a very heavy responsibility to their countrymen of the present and future generations. In that case, when future historians come to write of the events now passing under our eyes, they will, I think, stand amazed at the want of versatility&#x2014;I might almost say the sterility of political conception&#x2014;shown by the Statesmen of the present day.<lb/>
My Lords, the details of the measure proposed by my noble friend will, without doubt, form the subject of full discussion when the Bill arrives at the Committee Stage. We are now only discussing the principle, and what reason is there that the principle should be absolutely rejected? I have heard of none which carries conviction to my mind. The proposal, indeed, appears to have stirred to its depths whatever amount of latent conservatism exists in the minds of noble Lords opposite. It appears to be regarded as a dangerous innovation. It is thought. to be more revolutionary than anything proposed or contemplated by His Majesty's Government and their followers. My Lords, when a political Party which has already treated the whole of our fiscal system with but scant regard for the traditions of the past, and which avowedly contemplates other and more drastic innovations in the body politic&#x2014;when such a Party warns us solemnly against being lured into the danger of revolutionary action, it is almost impossible not to receive their admonitions with a certain amount of amused scepticism. <i>Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes?</i> Without doubt, there are many of us who regret the necessity of having recourse to a measure of this sort. We should have preferred, had it been possible, to proceed on the old traditional lines of an unwritten and elastic Constitution. But such a course is no longer possible. A revolution of one sort or another has been forced on us. I care not to inquire who is responsible for its advent. Noble Lords opposite will say that the responsibility rests with those who rejected the Budget&#x2014;a decision, I may remark incidentally, for which neither the noble Lord who introduced this Bill nor myself is in any degree responsible. Noble Lords on this side of the House may reply that the rejection of the Budget in no way justifies the introduction of a single-Chamber system, which they hold, rightly
<col>730</col>
in my opinion, will be the outcome of the programme adopted by the Government. Nothing, my Lords, is to be gained by bandying these half-truths and recriminations from one side to the other. The fact remains that, whatever be the cause or justification, proposals which may justly be termed revolutionary have emanated from the present Government, and the only effective way to check this revolution is by initiating other proposals which noble Lords opposite are quite welcome, if they choose, to designate as a counter-revolution.<lb/>
And, my Lords, after all, considering all the circumstances in which we are now placed, is this proposal so very revolutionary? Is it not merely the natural and logical application of those democratic principles which are accepted by all in this country, and by none more than your Lordships, except perhaps by the extreme democrats themselves? The noble Earl the Leader of the House, whose temporary absence we all regret, twitted my noble friend the other day on the ground that he, a staunch Conservative, was enunciating the principles of the <i>Contrat Social</i>. My Lords, it is many years since I read the <i>Contrat Social</i>, but unless my memory plays me false Rousseau maintained that the British nation were under a great delusion in supposing they were a free people. He said that they were only free during a General Election, and that subsequently, having resigned their sovereignty, they were the slaves of the Parliament they had elected. When we consider the use which is avowedly going to be made of the majority obtained at the last election, when we reflect that that majority, returned not to abolish' but to reform the Second Chamber, is to be used to carry into effect drastic measures in other directions on which the country has not been consulted, I am not at all sure that Rousseau was not a true prophet.<lb/>
The noble Lord who introduced this Bill has explained with great eloquence and lucidity why he and those who agree with him advocate the principles set forth in the Bill. We do not say that the representative system has broken down, but we maintain that its operation has undergone profound modifications. The absence of any system of proportional representation, the activity and ability of Party managers, and the impossibility of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0391"/>
<col>731</col>
differentiating between those questions to which the electors have and those to which they have not assented, have destroyed the practical guarantees which formerly existed that the majority of the House of Commons represents, in respect to any special issue of importance, the real opinions of the electors. My Lords, we want this Bill to stop log-rolling. Both the noble Earl the Leader of the House and the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack have pointed out the risks which would be involved in the acceptance of the principles of the Referendum. The noble and learned Lord asks what is likely to happen if the people are asked to give their opinion on a proposal to put an Income Tax of 50 per cent. on all incomes in excess of &#x00A3;5,000 a year. My Lords, I asked exactly the same question when the Parliament Bill was under discussion a few months ago, and I was told in reply that we could rely on the common sense of the people of this country not to approve of any such absurd proposal. I trust that that view is correct, but I maintain that under the proposal of my noble friend the people will have an opportunity of showing their common sense, whereas under the programme of His Majesty's Government no such opportunity will be given to them. Any fiscal monstrosity may be inserted into a Money Bill and passed into law without risk of interference from the Second Chamber when once the Speaker's certificate, which he will be unable to refuse, has been signed.<lb/>
But then we were told by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, when he was pressed by my noble friend Lord Balfour, that we were not discussing the Parliament Bill. That is quite true; but, my Lords, I submit that it is quite impossible to discuss the present proposal adequately without instituting some comparison between the two systems. Moreover, the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, on the occasion of the First Reading of this Bill, adopted a line of argument which is a virtual admission of the necessity of making such a comparison. If, the noble and learned Lord argued, the Parliament Bill is a bad one, that is no reason for passing another measure which the noble and learned Lord evidently thinks is much worse. My Lords, the relative merits of the two programmes is a matter of opinion, but I submit that, assuming the Referendum to be objectionable on its own merits, there
<col>732</col>
would be some force in the noble and learned Lord's argument if His Majesty's Government would submit the whole of their programme, including the reform of this House, to both Houses of Parliament, not merely for discussion, but also for amendment. But the plea falls to the ground when we are given to understand that no serious attempt at compromise is to be made, and that, if needs be, the views of the Government will be carried out by an extreme exercise of the Royal Prerogative. If this be the case, there is no alternative but to sketch out a general programme which may be laid before the country to take the place of that set forth by the Government.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, another, and I readily admit a more serious, objection has been urged against the principle of the Bill. It is held that if it passes into law a fatal blow will be given to the principle of representative Government, because the adoption of the system known as the initiative must necessarily follow that of the Referendum. In fact, if I understand rightly, there is some apprehension that we may revert to the chaos and confusion which existed under the ancient Commonwealths before representative institutions had been called into existence. If it could be shown that the initiative must necessarily pass into the hands of the people if once the Referendum system were adopted, and that thus the sovereignty of the people would, as a matter of common practice, be asserted directly, and not through their representatives, I fully admit that the objection would be serious. But can this be shown? I think not. Whilst fully agreeing in what has been said as to the fallacy involved in endeavouring to establish too close an analogy between this and other countries, I think it is worth while to allude to the reasons which have led to the very tentative steps made towards the introduction of the initiative system in the United States of America. Mr. Bryce, who is nothing if he is not judicial, says that&#x2014;
<quote>"the source of the desire of the people to take power out of the hands of the Legislature and wield it themselves probably lies, not so much in the eagerness of the masses to carry further the principle of popular sovereignty, as in a certain impatience with the representative Assemblies, which are supposed to be too largely the creatures of the Party organisations, and to be liable to yield to the influences which powerful financial interests can bring to bear."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0392"/>
<col>733</col>
Now, my Lords, leaving alone the allusion to the powerful financial interests, a discussion of which would involve me in the meshes of the fiscal controversy, I wish to point out that what Mr. Bryce says in the passage which I have quoted exactly applies to our case at present. If the Party organisations be allowed to wield unchecked the predominating power of which they now dispose, the almost inevitable result will be that the people will become impatient, and that they will wish to assert their sovereignty in a manner which might, indeed, inflict a fatal blow on the representative system. Whereas by applying a timely remedy, by arranging, as I hope will be arranged, that resort will only be had to the Referendum on very rare occasions, there is every hope that any danger of this kind will be averted, and that the result will be the same as that which, in another passage in his work, Mr. Bryce has told us has ensued in America&#x2014;that is to say, that the assertion of the direct sovereignty of the whole people "has tended to check revolutionary tendencies."<lb/>
Moreover, my Lords, does not this plea that we are not to adopt the Referendum because it may lead to the demand for the initiative rather savour of the well-worn fallacy known as "the thin end of the wedge" argument; that is to say, the argument that we are not to adopt some relatively moderate and unobjectionable reform because it may lead to the demand of sonic far more drastic and more objectionable reform at a later period? No one will deny that in some cases the plea may be allowed to hold good. Personally I think that Woman's Suffrage is a case in point. But it is an argument which has always been regarded with much distrust by reforming politicians, and I have certainly always understood that it was particularly obnoxious to Liberal politicians; for, in fact, past experience has shown that if it had been habitually accepted some of the most useful measures that have ever become law in this country would have been nipped in the bud. I believe we may safely consider this question on its own merits as one that, under present circumstances, is calculated to strengthen rather than to weaken our existing institutions, and that we need not be frightened by the bugbear that it will deal a death-blow to the representative system. For these reasons, my Lords,I
<col>734</col>
trust that the principle embodied in my noble friend's Bill will receive the approval of this House. It is one which should, I think, command the assent of moderate men of all Parties, inasmuch as the measure, if passed into law, will constitute a barrier against the attacks of those extremists who, like the Jacobins of a century ago, have usurped the forms, but do not appear to have imbibed the true spirit, of popular government. On the other hand, if nothing of the kind is clone, I confidently anticipate after a short lapse of time the advent of a period when the inure moderate politicians on the Liberal side will be looking anxiously about for some barrier to save them from being carried off their legs by the extremists of their own Party.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01506"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this question has not been presented in quite such a definite way as I should have liked in order to get a clear issue with regard to it. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Cromer) said that the Referendum has been made a part of the policy of the Conservative Party in order to meet a revolution by a counter revolution, but we were told last night by the Leader of that Party that it was a proposal which they did not intend to support in the Division Lobby. I do not quite see how a Bill can be part of the Conservative policy and yet be a Bill which the Conservative Party, though extending to it. a sort of benevolent sympathy, are not prepared to accept on Second Reading.<lb/>
I desire to approach this question from what I would call a moderate and Constitutional point of view. I quite agree with Lord Cromer that we are in a revolutionary period. In the debate on the rejection of the Budget of 1909 I ventured to say that this House had then entered upon an era of revolution. A revolutionary period was perhaps on its way, and could have been signalled by an approaching atmospheric depression; but we found ourselves in the centre of the cyclone when this House broke through the traditions of centuries and rejected the Budget. All politicians and Statesmen have recognised for many years that the House of Commons must be the supreme force in the Legislature and in determining what shall be the government of the country. Prominent Statesmen in this House&#x2014;I need only mention the late
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0393"/>
<col>735</col>
Lord Salisbury and the present Leader of the Conservative Party&#x2014;have rendered lip-service to this principle. They have told us over and over again that. all they claim for the House of Lords is the power of delay and of appeal, not from Philip drunk to Philip sober, but from the hasty first impressions of the people to their deliberate and reconsidered decision. In that I go a great way with the Conservative Party.<lb/>
I agree that in times of passion and excitement there should be an opportunity of calling a certain pause and of securing that the country should not be swept away by passion, but should have the opportunity of considering twice or even three times before determining on something which may be irrevocable. But is the Referendum a less revolutionary method of reconsidering than the proposal of the Government? The Referendum would, I think, in some cases work very harshly. The noble Earl who resumed the debate to-night pointed out by figures that, ordinarily speaking, the electors would not be much interested, and that it would require a much greater effort of the Parties to work them up than is the case at a General Election. As was said by the noble Earl, where we have the Referendum it has worked harshly. It was introduced into municipal government I think sixteen or eighteen years ago. Before then local authorities could promote measures involving loans pledging the credit of a town, but. since then we know that proposals which have been very desirable in the interests of the town have been repeatedly delayed for a year or more owing to the slackness and the indifference of the electors, which have led to a very light vote and sometimes to the rejection of a measure which the town really needed. In quiet times the Referendum might succeed in postponing legislation, though I do not think that is any great advantage, but it would offer no barrier to an excited and fierce people when there was some great crisis which roused the passions of the people to the utmost. What would have been the effect if, when the Lords threw out the first Reform Bill, they had had a Referendum and the Whig Government had presented their case to the country? There is very little doubt, not only that the rotten boroughs would have come toppling down, but that the House of Lords and the Bench of Bishops would have toppled down with them.<lb/>
<col>736</col>
Another reason why I object to the Referendum is that I believe in the voice of the people uttered through their representatives and through a deliberative Assembly, but not in the voice of the people collected by a <i>plebiscite</i>. There are many measures which Parliament has passed and which Parliament ought to pass for which if you took a Referendum you would very likely not get a popular majority. My reading of history is that at the time when every Statesman and every political leader was convinced that the day had passed by for any further opposition to Catholic Emancipation and that the time had come for surrender to the claims of the Catholics there was so much anti-Popery feeling in the country that if the question had been put to the people Catholic Emancipation would have been rejected. There are many occasions on which it becomes a Parliamentary duty on the part of the Statesmen who have been chosen to govern the country to display courage and independence of thought and action, and to bring forward measures although at the time they may believe the people would not support them. Then I have heard it urged by Conservatives as an argument in favour of the Referendum that it would destroy log-rolling. It is represented that the Party now supporting the present Government is a composite Party, and that the Government is a composite Government, and concedes something to A, something to B, and something else to C, and that by their combined force they carry their measures. I would remind your Lordships that it is the duty of Liberals&#x2014;I will say it is the duty of Statesmen&#x2014;to deal with reforms though they know they only appeal to the interests of a particular section and may not appeal to the general mass of ignorant or indifferent opinion, and to pass them by an appeal to the reasoned allegiance of their supporters in Parliament and not to trust to an appeal to the public, many of whom care little or nothing about the matter. Take, for example, the question of the Scottish Land Bill or of Welsh Disestablishment. If these things are right, then I think it is for thoughtful men who have studied politics and come together in the House and heard debate and talk in the Lobbies to thrash out the question, and, if they make up their minds that the time has come to carry those measures, to carry them without caring whether they interest their electors in the constituencies or not, and avoid getting the electors excited over matters which really do not touch them.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0394"/>
<col>737</col>
My Lords, when we consider the intricacy and the diversity of the problems with which our Government have to deal, our world-wide interests, our Colonies, our trade, and so on, I think it would be a miserable abdication of responsibility if any Government were to clutch at the Referendum and entrust the determination of important questions of national policy to the ill-considered and ignorant voice of the people as it might be when stirred up. If you want to avoid revolutionary changes when public feeling is excited, you must make it easy for the popular body in Parliament to carry small changes bit by bit, and to readjust the machinery of Government, and make your revolution piecemeal instead of in the gross. The whole world has gone through a process of revolution, and is not the question whether you will take the revolution by degrees or in the lump? Take the history of France. Every one knows that if there was such stupidity in the governing forces of that; country during the whole of the eighteenth century as to make no reform possible they were bound to have the bloody and revolutionary change which came at the end of that century. I suppose that every important reform that has been made has been grudged by the Conservative Party, but how many of those changes would noble Lords on the Front Opposition Bench now say they regretted Your Lordships have been educated by the experience of the past, but you do not allow that education to enlighten you as to what your conduct should be in the future. I say it is the maddest recklessness, it is not Conservatism, to try and convert the responsible and deliberate Government of this country into a mere pl&#x00E9;biscitary Government, to be sluggish in quiet times and revolutionary in excited times.<lb/>
I do not go into the details of the noble Lord's Bill. I do not care to pick up the little crumbs of comfort to be found, the little concessions that are made, in the recognition of our grievances and the admission that the relations of the Lords to the people have been for some time unsatisfactory. Of course, they have been unsatisfactory. They were bound to be unsatisfactory from the moment you emancipated the House of Commons from subjection to the territorial classes whose dominant place is in the House of Lords. It takes a generation for people gradually to realise their strength and what their wishes are, but these things must come and
<col>738</col>
do come. The House of Lords might have jogged on, I do not think very happily because the relations were unsatisfactory, had it not precipitated this conflict by accentuating the impossibility of working on the traditional unwritten understanding by breaking that understanding. The weaker Party broke it, and they have to make up their minds now what they are going to do. The weaker Party is the Party which have not got the mass of the electorate of the country behind them. Occasionally the Conservative Party in this country accidentally get a majority of the electorate, largely by the jettisoning of a number of their old principles and sometimes outbidding the Liberals in democratic and even Socialistic proposals. Noble Lords opposite who went up and down the country during the last election must have seen that you were face to face with a growing democratic spirit in the country, and that the existing House of Lords is absolutely inconsistent with that spirit. Your Lordships are good and kind and humane men enough individually, but what strikes me when you get together collectively is the utter want of touch between your Lordships and the country outside; and as you have not chosen to quietly acquiesce in the changed relations between the two Houses and between this House and the country, you have to accept now what is the beginning, in some respects at any rate, of a written Constitution. But, my Lords, personally I should still wish to go on as far as possible by means of understandings and gradual adjustments of matters of difference, because the merit of our Constitution is that it is an unwritten Constitution, the good sense of the people being content to use old forms, from time to time putting new spirit into them, so as to secure that those who govern the country should be in sympathy with the mass of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01507"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who has been in Australia more recently than the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, perhaps I may preface the few observations I have to offer on the Bill in general with one or two comments upon the speech with which the noble Earl commenced our proceedings to-day. In the first place, I cannot agree with the noble Earl in what he appeared to consider a fatal objection to this Bill&#x2014;namely, that the proposals in it did not coincide precisely with the systems adopted in the United States, in Switzerland, or in our oversea Dominions. Surely
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0395"/>
<col>739</col>
the Mother of Parliaments is great enough not only to accept the principle, but to regulate the manner in which that principle should be applied according to her own wisdom and understanding. With regard to the special quotations which the noble Earl made from Australian history, he undoubtedly gave them with that perfect accuracy which I should have expected from him, but I should like to make one or two comments upon the lessons which he drew from them. He spoke first of all of the small percentage of votes which were cast at the elections in Australia, and referred to the indifference which that showed on the part of the Australian people towards public questions in general. I agree with him that it is deplorable that so small a percentage of votes should be cast in Australia upon public questions, but I must remind him that this was equally the case at Parliamentary Elections; the apathy was not confined to special questions connected with the Referendum, but was general. I fail to recall any single election in Australia at which eighty per cent. of the electors voted.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl referred to the trouble of putting the machinery of the Referendum into motion for the purpose of effecting a very slight change. If I thought that in this country the Referendum was to be applied to very small questions I should consider his objection a very serious one, undoubtedly so with regard to this country. But I would remind the noble Earl that the Australian Constitution was entirely a new one. Slight imperfections had crept into it, and the Referendum was the only machinery by which those imperfections could be put right. That would not apply in a Constitution like our own, where the Referendum would not be put into force except in cases of considerable gravity. Then, again, the Bill of my noble friend Lord Balfour, if I read it rightly, would expressly exclude any financial proposals being submitted to a Referendum, pond that question, which is a difficult one in Australia, would not arise in this country. The noble Earl made special reference to the case of Queensland and to the position in which the Premier of Queensland was placed in having to carry through legislation in consequence of the expressed will of the people, although he was personally opposed to that legislation. That was, he said, a position in which Ministers in this country
<col>740</col>
would never place themselves. But I do not know that there is anything peculiarly degrading in such a position. We on this side of the House who are in a majority have from time to time to acquiesce and tacitly assist in the carrying of measures in which we do not believe, because they are thought to be desired by the people at large. I have never considered that in so acquiescing we were acting in a dishonourable manner. My noble friend made a perfectly true statement with regard to the practice in Australia in the case of a deadlock between the two Houses. It is undoubtedly the case that when there is a deadlock between the two Houses, the Referendum is not invoked to settle the difference. What is invoked is a Dissolution. If the noble Earl prefers that when there is a similar difficulty here the Government should submit the matter to the arbitrament of a General Election so be it. I do not think the Opposition would have very great objection. The noble Earl taunted the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition with his alleged curtailment of the number of subjects to which he would wish to see the Referendum applied. But, however limited that number may be, the number is greater than that suggested by His Majesty's Ministers, for they do not intend to consult the people upon any occasion at all.<lb/>
My Lords, general questions have already been so fully discussed that I will not detain the House with more than a single word upon them. It has been said that there is something un-Conservative and un-Constitutional in our action in favouring the principle of the Referendum. I must say that I have never been able to see upon what ground that charge is based. Our principle is that we desire to ascertain and carry out the will of the people when it is once plainly expressed, and, as I take it, the Referendum is merely intended to be a comparatively easy, simple, and cheap method of ascertaining what that will is. I need hardly reiterate what previous speakers have said, that so long as the far more revolutionary proposals of His Majesty's Government are before the country we are not very much moved by their tender concern for our possible lapses into Radical legislation.<lb/>
Now I wish to deal a little more in detail with sonic of the principal objections raised to the Referendum. I think they are
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0396"/>
<col>741</col>
mainly three in number. In the first place it is said that by its adoption the responsibilities of Members of Parliament would be seriously diminished, and, indeed, transferred into the hands of a <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i> So far from that being the case, my contention is that those responsibilities would be materially augmented. I say that for this reason. Under a Referendum every Bill will have to be introduced into both Houses of Parliament and go through the whole of its stages in both houses&#x2014;First Reading, Second Reading, Committee, Report, and so on, and the votes of every Member will be very keenly watched and criticised by his constituents. He will vote under the knowledge, if the Bill be one that is to be submitted to a Referendum, that his constituents will have an early opportunity of expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the way in which he has acted. Therefore I certainly do not think that he will escape any responsibility by the adoption of the Referendum. Then a second complaint is that the electors will be bemused and puzzled by a number of catch questions which it is supposed will be put to there, or by a confusion of the issues upon which they are called to vote. As I understand it: there will be no catch questions of any sort or kind. The elector will have the Bill presented to him, and he will be asked, "you, or do you riot, wish this Bill to become law?" I cannot conceive that any simpler question can possibly be put to an elector, and it must anyhow be a simpler matter than the multitude of questions upon all possible subjects of foreign and domestic policy upon which at a General Election he is at present supposed to be amply qualified to express an opinion. Then there is the third objection, the question of cost. It is possible to spend money upon anything, but I do not see that there need be any very great difficulty in materially limiting the cost of the taking of a Referendum. In the first place, it would be perfectly easy to pass some amending Act of the nature of the Corrupt Practices Act by which expenditure upon bill-posting, pictures, and so forth 'should be prohibited; and, in the second place, I think that the common sense of the people would preclude the expenditure of a great deal of money. When a General Election takes place, A. and B. are candidates for seat. They have a very keen and direct ersonal interest as to who shall occupy
<col>742</col>
that seat, and they spend all the money they legitimately can, and I am afraid sometimes a great deal more, in the endeavour to secure the seat. But when it is merely a question of endeavouring to ascertain the views of the electors as to whether a particular Bill shall become law or not, there will be no occasion for anybody to spend any particular money upon it, and I think a poll of the people could be taken without any excessive cost.<lb/>
The advantages of such a reference to the people and to the Government of the day are manifest. So far as the Ministry of the day are concerned, let me take such cases as those of the Licensing Bill and the Education Bill, both of which the present Government failed to pass through Parliament. I am bound to assume that they very keenly regretted the loss of those two Bills. At the same time they did not consider that their loss was sufficient to warrant them in putting the country to the cost and trouble of a General Election, and consequently the two Bills had to go. But had a Referendum been adopted. it would have been possible to put those two measures to the country, and if approved they could have been passed into law. The advantage to the electors would, I think, be equally great. Take the case of a constituency or a body of electors who are well satisfied with tile general fiscal and domestic policy of their Government, who have no particular wish to change the Ministers, but who object, let us say as an instance, to the Declaration of London. They do not wish to turn out the Ministry, but they do wish to say that on this particular question the opinion of the majority of the electors is not represented. They could do so by means of the Referendum. Ministers would then know that in that particular direction the country did not go with them, and they could proceed with tie other portions of their policy with regard to which they might still retain the confidence of their supporters. If I may venture upon a very domestic parallel I would say that the position is very much like that of one of your Lordships who may have occasion to reprove a servant but may not consider his offence serious enough to justify giving him a month's notice.<lb/>
The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition when expressing approval of the general principle of the Bill said that
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0397"/>
<col>743</col>
he was glad that it was not the intention of Lord Balfour to press the measure to a Division or attempt to carry it through Committee. I entertain precisely the same view. I agree with the principle of the Bill, but I consider that there are very serious drawbacks to this measure. As was said by the noble Earl who resumed the debate, the first clause of the Bill does not make sufficient distinction between rejected and amended Bills. The Government of the day would be perfectly justified in referring to the country the text of their original Bill which was rejected <i>en bloc</i> by this House; but in the case where the Commons do not agree to Amendments made in this House and the Bill is to go to the country, I think opportunity should be given to the people to say whether they prefer the original Bill or the Bill as amended. I take objection also to Clause 2. I consider that the theory of Parliament is that the House of Commons represents the immediate views of the electors; it is in closer and more immediate contact than this Chamber can possibly be with the electorate, and can be taken as representing their views on any question at the immediate moment. On the other hand, this House, not having the fear of constituencies before its eyes, is at liberty to give rather calmer consideration to hasty legislation than the Lower House, and to delay, and refer if need be to the people, any measures upon which they may think that the House of Commons does not truly represent the feeling of the country. But when we have a case in which both Houses&#x2014;the directly representative House and the more deliberative Assembly&#x2014;are of opinion that a measure is good, I think we must take it that that represents the deliberate judgment of the country for the time being. Therefore I am entirely averse to giving any minority, whether 200 or any other number, the power of inflicting frequent Referenda upon the country by appeals against a decision arrived at by both Chambers. Of course, I agree that there is one contingency under which the absence of this provision might possibly act somewhat unfairly to the Party of noble Lords opposite, and that is where possibly reactionary legislation might be imposed against the will of the country in the event of a Conservative or Unionist majority in both Houses.<lb/>
In this democratic age anything in the nature of serious reactionary legislation
<col>744</col>
is in the very highest degree improbable, and I do honestly believe that the advantages the Government of the day would derive from the adoption of the Referendum would be more than an equivalent for any risk they might run under the contingency I have alluded to. I must also remind your Lordships of an additional advantage which the Ministry would have&#x2014;namely, that it would be only the Ministry of the day who could decide whether the Referendum was to be applied or not, because they would always have the alternative of putting up with the rejection of a Bill if they did not see fit to consult the country upon it. In those circumstances, my Lords, I can only express my gratification with the main portions of the Bill that my noble friend Lord Balfour has introduced, and my confident hope that sooner or later its main principle, a principle which has already been adopted and approved by many foreign countries and by some of our own Colonies, will become a permanent portion of the legislative machinery of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01508"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WEARDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this debate, initiated as it has been by the introduction of the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Balfour, has, in consequence of the attitude of noble Lords opposite, and I think of the admissions of the noble Lord himself, degenerated into rather an academic discussion of the principle of the Referendum. I therefore desire to intervene at this stage in order to give utterance to the belief of a growing section of advanced Liberal opinion that the introduction of the Referendum in a limited form in connection with the settlement of our Constitutional difficulties would be to the advantage and for the protection of the democracy. That is the standpoint from which I desire to discuss this question.<lb/>
I regret that, holding the opinions I do, I should, so far as my side of the House is concerned, have had occasion to listen only to speeches presenting adamantine opposition to the principle of the Referendum. There was the speech on the First Reading of the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, whose absence we all deeply deplore; there was the speech of my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack&#x2014;and, if he will allow me to say so, my Radical friend of former days in the House of Commons; and there was the speech of the noble Viscount who spoke with such effect yesterday upon this question. But, happily, I am somewhat
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0398"/>
<col>745</col>
comforted, because I know that the Prime Minister has not shown quite that pertinacious opposition which has been manifested by his colleagues who have spoken in this House. He has confessed that at an earlier stage&#x2014;I do not quite know when&#x2014;he had a flirtation with the Referendum, and, what is very unusual, I think, with my right hon. friend, he has abandoned his early love, and all he is content to say is that he will not bar and bolt the door against the introduction of this principle, in a limited form, perhaps, on some future occasion.<lb/>
My Lords, I will now deal with some of the objections which have been raised by my noble friends on this side of the House to the Referendum on any terms whatever. The first objection, and it appears to me the most important, is that the Referendum is destructive of representative government. The Lord Chancellor said that it would be fatal to representative government, and the words of Lord Morley were that it would do a great deal to abolish the representative system. I should like to ask not only noble Lords in this House but everybody concerned in this grave Constitutional crisis whether at this moment we really enjoy representative Government. I have been long in political life, and I have had the advantage denied to sonic of the noble Lords who have taken part in this debate of sitting for many years in the House of Commons. I have had, perhaps, not quite so long an experience as some, but I have had an experience of eight contested elections on behalf of Liberal principles, and I can remember the time, before the introduction of the caucus into our Party system, when the House of Commons offered a reasonable field for the exercise of independent judgment. I am not quarrelling with the caucus; it was, perhaps, a necessary introduction into our political system; it came to us from America, and I believe it was introduced by a right hon. gentleman who has not been particularly successful in his importations, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. But having been introduced, what has been its effect?<lb/>
We all know now that a candidate who presents himself has to undergo a most searching examination on the part of the Party caucus, and sometimes a competitive examination. He then has to submit to an endless variety of questions and give a number of pledges before being accepted, and
<col>746</col>
after he has been accepted as the candidate the same process is gone through with all sorts of outside associations, with the result that by the time he reaches the House of Commons and takes his seat in that Assembly he is almost as much tied and bound as a modern lady in a bobble skirt. That is the situation. I listened with some astonishment to my noble friend Lord Carrington last night when he accused me of sharing in the dreams of Rousseau, and threw cold water, as did the noble Viscount, on the statements of a Member of the House of Commons, Mr. Snowden, who takes the same view as I have ventured to lay before your Lordships as to the present position of private Members. When bound and pledged, his independence half gone, a man reaches the House of Commons he finds all kinds of restrictions placed upon his actions. They have the gag, they have the guillotine, they have the persistent demands of the Government of the day&#x2014;and one Government is just as bad as another&#x2014;upon the time of private Members, and I venture to state that there is not one single Member of the House of Commons to-day outside the actual or presumptive officials who will not bear me out in saying that his boasted independence is gone, and consequently he has become in a great majority of instances a mere machine who has to do as he is told. We heard something also last night of the utterances of a former respected Whip, my noble colleague Lord Marchamley. I am sure Lord Marchamley's experiences are those of every other gentleman who has been in his position. The noble Lord knows perfectly well that if a Member is recalcitrant, if he ventures to have the slightest independence of view, the Whip has immediately to exercise all the pressure and persuasion possible. What does he do He goes to that Member and says&#x2014;and very often, I regret to say, he says it with truth&#x2014;that half or perhaps all his election expenses were paid out of the Party funds, and he must remember that or they would remember it when the next election came round.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01509"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: I was a Whip for three years and I do not think I ever said such a thing, and I do not believe any other Whip has ever said such a thing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01510"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WEARDALE</member><membercontribution>: I do not say the noble Lord used Those actual words. What I say is that Party Whips give it to be understood, and it is within my knowledge that they have said
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0399"/>
<col>747</col>
it. In the same way it is said that if the hon. Member who is thus addressed will be good enough to support the Government, the Government will think of him, and that there are certain preferments and certain advantages which may be conferred upon him if he will do so. Now, my Lords, I frankly say that a House, for whose great traditions I have profound respect, where so many of its Members are in that position of fettered dependence is not in the true sense of the word a really representative House. It is all tending to one end, and that end is the general strengthening of an official oligarchy called the Cabinet. I am not referring to one Cabinet more than another, but what. I say is that under a system of this kind it is the Cabinet and not Parliament that really governs the country, and it is in order that some sort of check should he placed upon what might prove to be an oligarchy of a most tyrannical character that I want to see a limited form of Referendum introduced which will give some security to the free and independent electors of this country.<lb/>
We had a speech to-night from my noble friend Lord Sheffield. He will excuse me for referring to that speech, because it represents the frame of mind of a certain class of Liberal. He told us that lie thought it was the duty of a Government to carry such measures as might commend themselves to their judgment, even it they were only acceptable to the minority. He said, "I do not see why any attention should be paid to the ignorant, ill-considered voice of the people." That is the position at which we have now arrived, that it is the view apparently of Liberalism of the official type that the Cabinet is to he empowered, no matter what may be the subject under discussion, to carry into law measures in the interests of a particular minority without any reference to, and in fact in total disregard of, the wishes of the people. I quite agree the noble Lord did not perhaps intend to give expression to such sentiments, but that is the natural and logical outcome of what he said.<lb/>
I come now to another branch of the question. We talk of representative government. Representative government no doubt in principle existed at the time when there were only two political Parties in the State. But what have we to-day? First we saw the growth of a Third Party, the Irish Party, in the days of Mr. Butt&#x2014;a small one which afterwards grew to be a
<col>748</col>
large and important Party under the leadership of Mr. Parnell. And side by side with that Party we have seen, happily I think, the growth of the Labour Party; and if, as I hope, we are near the day when Home Rule will be granted not only to Ireland but to other parts of the country under the scheme of Home Rule all round, we shall also have a Scottish Party and a Welsh Party. Therefore, my Lords, the whole conditions are changed. We have now a Government which is dependent on the support of groups. It is no longer the Party system we have to deal with; it is the group system; and although I for one am exceedingly satisfied that the present Government have been able to come to terms with the Irish Party and the Labour Party, and although I am entirely in sympathy with their views with regard to Home Rule, the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales, and plural voting, yet, my Lords, I do say that it is perfectly possible, looking into the future, to see how great will be the danger unless you have some kind of safeguard against what I may call immoral grouping to the prejudice of the real interests of the country as a whole. Therefore it is that I am in favour of the principle of the Referendum on a limited scale, surrounded by the greatest safeguards, and operating only in the rarest instances.<lb/>
The noble Viscount quoted as an instance of the difficulty of passing measures through this House the Irish Church Bill, which no doubt only became law after a good deal of resistance by the Tory Party. But I would suggest to him that the existence of the Referendum in a limited form might serve the cause of progress much better than any scheme which has yet been propounded for dealing with the relations of the two Houses. Suppose, on the other hand, that during the last Conservative Parliament there had been, as the Bill proposes and as I entirely approve, the power of an imposing minority to refer a Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament to the judgment of the people, what would have happened with the last Education Bill passed by the Tory Government? Everybody knows that the passage of that Bill raised a storm of resentment throughout the country; its evil effects are apparent still to-day; the country teems with passive resisters; and yet we have been unable to redress the evil. If the Referendum had been in existence, that Bill might have
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0400"/>
<col>749</col>
been referred to the people and the whole matter left open to a wider and happier solution.<lb/>
I pass from that branch of the question to one or two others. First of all, I should like to make a few observations upon the objections that have been raised, and rightly raised, with reference to the stability of Government. It is said that supposing a Government referred to the people a Bill which they were unable to pass through the Upper House, and that the country refused its approbation of that Bill, it would immediately involve the resignation of the Government. I dissent front that view. I do not believe that it would involve the resignation of the Government. It might conceivably involve the resignation of the Minister principally concerned; it might also possibly mean the reconstruction of the Government itself; but I do not for one moment believe that in the great majority of instances it would mean the resignation of the Government. But, more than that, if the Bill were really a Bill which met with the firm resistance of the country when referred to it, is it not right and proper that the Ministry should resign? surely the moment they find that they have lost the confidence of the country it is desirable that they should give place to others.<lb/>
I know that objections have been raised to the principle of the Referendum by various friends of mine representing different classes of opinion. In the first place, it is strongly resisted by the Irish Party. I believe myself that the Irish Party would have nothing to fear front the establishment of the Referendum. My own opinion is that a Home Rule Bill drawn on fair lines safe-guarding the Imperial interests of this country would not fail to receive the acceptance of both Houses of Parliament, and, if it did not it would certainly be accepted by the country at large upon a Referendum. My own impression is that the country is beginning to be sick of the controversy over the Irish question and is only too anxious for a settlement. Then there is another large body of opinion that I would refer to&#x2014;that of the Labour Party. My friend Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, for whom I have the highest respect, has spoken disparagingly of the Referendum, but I would remind him and those who agree with hint that the Labour world&#x2014;not the Labour Party in Parliament&#x2014;has already accepted the principle of the Referendum in all its
<col>750</col>
local concerns. It has accepted the ballot, and I would point oat that the value of the ballot from the Labour point of view has been manifested extraordinarily during the last few months. In the West of England only a few days ago strikingly so, when the advice of the most respected Labour leaders was rejected by the men by enormous majorities. The truth is, my Lords, that deep down in the minds of the people there is a distinct desire to preserve their right to say the last word on all matters that affect their welfare and their destiny. It is not enough to tell thorn that they have their representative in Parliament. It is not enough to tell them t hat a measure has been sufficiently discussed in Parliament.<lb/>
And, my Lords, we see that in other countries the same sentiment is growing on all hands. It. is growing in America; it is growing, although the signs may not be so apparent to-day, on the Continent both in Belgium and in France. In Belgium particularly there is a movement on foot for the establishment of the Referendum for precisely the same reasons that I argue in its favour to-day. It is really the due protection and the fair protection, as I conceive, of democratic progress that all these partisan combinations which sometimes unfortunately distort our representative institutions should have some restriction placed upon t hem, so that the wishes of the people should really prevail in the settlement of the affairs of the nation. I regret to have had to intervene in this debate, and to give expression to certain views which are not, perhaps, sympathised in by many of my noble friends; but I conceive it to be the duty of every member of this House&#x2014;as I conceived it to he my duty when I sat for so many years in the House of Commons&#x2014;to speak his mind with sincerity and courage. I did so, my Lords, in the midst of much heated controversy at the time of the South African War, when many of my right hon. friends deserted us, I regret to say, in the hour of distress. I have done so to-night, and I shall ever be prepared to give utterance to the opinions I hold without any fear of what the consequences may be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01511"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help wondering what kind of reception the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down would have met with had it been delivered in another place. As the noble Lord truly observed, a good deal of the importance of this debate has diminished
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0401"/>
<col>751</col>
in consequence of the very broad hint which was given by the noble Marquess to my noble friend who introduced this Bill, recommending him not to press it to a Division; and although the noble Marquess with his habitual modesty, disclaimed any special control over the actions of this House, I have always observed that the hints of the noble Marquess exercise pretty much the same effect upon the Benches on this side of the House as the nod of Jove exercised upon the denizens of Olympus. My Lords, although we shall not conclude this debate with the excitement of a Division, the debate has at all events been productive of considerable interest. The main interest, so far as I am concerned, consists in the fact that it has displayed a. most curious inversion of political principles. I learn, I confess somewhat to my surprise, that we on these Benches are the only true representatives of the democracy. Noble Lords opposite apparently do not represent the genuine article. I hope I am not using an offensive expression when I say that they are apparently, in the opinion of some of the supporters of the Bill, a kind of political hybrids who at one moment are revolutionary single-Chamber men and at another moment little better than rusty reactionaries.<lb/>
This Bill is recommended to us as the legitimate outcome of a democratic principle, and I am not ashamed to confess that so far as I am concerned that recommendation does not carry very much weight. I do not profess to he a democrat. It would not be any use trying to make people believe that I was one, and I am afraid that I entertain a profound conviction that if the country really wants democratic measures it would be more inclined to go to the Party represented by noble Lords opposite than to apply for them to this side of this House. My noble friend Lord Balfour puts forward this Bill as a sort of panacea, a modest panacea I admit, for all the political diseases front which we are suffering at the present moment. In the first place, this Bill is going to solve the Constitutional deadlock. Upon that point I own that I am in considerable agreement with the noble Lord, and I think that any impartial person will at once admit that his proposal is so far much the most practical that has hitherto been advanced. But this is not the only benefit which is going to be conferred by this Bill if it ever passes into law. It is going to restore the idea of our Con-
<col>752</col>
stitution&#x2014;that the people should govern. It is going to make the House of Commons more careful as to what Bills it passes; it is going to be a check upon extremists; it is going to constitute a premium on moderation; it is going to establish fair dealing between the two Parties; it is going to prevent people being taken by surprise, and it is going to imbue Members of Parliament with a greater sense of responsibility. The multifarious benefits which are attributed to this Bill remind me of an implement which my noble friend Lord Wemyss, whom I am sorry not to see present, was always associated with in my mind. That implement was at once a spade, a knife, a saw, a razor, a chest protector, and a utensil upon which you could cook your dinner. The reception accorded by the War Office to my noble friend's invention was certainly not more sympathetic than that now accorded by the Government to Lord Balfour's Bill. When I consider the multifarous benefits which this Bill is going to confer upon the people of this country, I feel inclined to ask why it was not proposed long ago.<lb/>
With regard to the history of the Referendum so far as it concerns British politics, the first mention of this nostrum occurred, if I am not mistaken, in that despised Report of what is known as the Rosebery Committee. The proposal of the Referendum occurred in one of the final paragraphs of that Report, somewhat in the nature of a lady's postscript to a letter. After that it disappeared from view, except in the columns of the <i>Spectator</i> and organs of that kind, in which its advantages and disadvantages were discussed at interminable length by professors and dons and people of that kind. It reappeared on the threshold of the last election, and now it emerges under the &#x0153;gis of my noble friend as a full-grown article in the programme of the Unionist Party, and it is recommended by my noble friend and by countless speakers upon public platforms as being not only a solution of the Constitutional deadlock but practically of everything else. I must confess, and I confess it very reluctantly, that I have been considerably impressed by the arguments of noble Lords opposite. There is one argument, however, which they made use of which did not impress me in the very least&#x2014;namely, that the Referendum if adopted in this country would sap the independence of the Member of Parliament. According to the fancy picture which is
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0402"/>
<col>753</col>
habitually drawn of a Member of Parliament by noble Lords opposite&#x2014;not, I admit, by my noble friend Lord Weardale&#x2014;the ideal Member of Parliament is a proud, fearless, and untrammelled being, who is practically as free as air. I am not going to say anything half so uncomplimentary about Members of the House of Commons as has been said by my noble friend opposite, but I think I may say without any offence that this is an entire misconception of the ordinary Member of Parliament. Instead of being this proud and fearless and untrammelled being, he is, in many instances at all events, a well disciplined gentleman who is at the beck and call of the Party Whip, and who passes a not inconsiderable portion of his time in tramping the Lobbies and voting the salaries of gentlemen whom he does not believe to be any cleverer than himself, and to whose speeches he has perforce to listen in discontented silence. Further if he ventures to show any independence at all he very soon finds, as the noble Lord pointed out, that the House of Commons is no place for him, and unless he is lucky enough to find a University to offer him hospitality he has to seek a more retired form of existence. Therefore the less talk there is about "loss of the independence and dignity of a Member of Parliament" under a proposal of this kind, the better. I maintain that he would not lose any independence or dignity under a proposal of the kind, but I think he would lose a good deal of something else.<lb/>
I cannot help feeling convinced in my own mind that if this proposal ever took place it would have a very unpleasant and possibly disastrous effect upon political life. Projecting my mind into the future, and assuming, as one ought to do, the worst&#x2014;assuming, for instance, that the Parliament Bill becomes law and, that the Referendum prevails in this country&#x2014;what will be the future of the Member of Parliament? He will, in the first place, have everybody in his division of the male sex over the age of twenty-one years with a vote, and in addition to that he will, in all probability, have a lot of females who will have a vote too, and much of his time will be passed in trying, probably without any success, to explain to these people how thoroughly he has earned the salary which they are good enough to pay him, and then he will have to face the contingency of several miniature General Elections during every session. It certainly appears to me from my experience
<col>754</col>
of political life that conditions of this kind will deter what we are fond of calling the best class of men from entering politics, whilst the voter, gorged and satiated with continual political discussion, will in all probability only be brought to the poll in the course of time by force, and it will be necessary probably before long to inflict upon him those penalties which are already imposed in other countries when the voter fails to take advantage of his power of voting.<lb/>
When this Bill was introduced the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said that if both parties were agreed the Referendum might he taken at any moment on any question. There is only one question upon which I can conceive that there would be any agreement between the various political Parties as to the taking of the Referendum. That question. I need hardly say, is the question of female suffrage. I can very well believe that the various Parties in the House of Commons might combine to demand a Referendum for the purpose of jockeying women out of the vote, but I cannot conceive there being any agreement between the various Parties for any other purpose. My Lords, our great difficulty&#x2014;when I say "our" I mean the Unionist Party&#x2014;is that we have not got reasonable people to deal with in the shape of the present Government. If we had reasonable people to deal with something might be done under the proposals of my noble friend. If the Government, for instance, really wanted to settle the Constitutional question instead of settling this House, which is, of course, their object, the Referendum would gladly be accepted as a means of escape from the Constitutional deadlock. I am entirely in sympathy with my noble friend as far as regards this particular portion of his Bill. As a final resort for the purpose of settling disputes between the two Houses it seems to me a perfectly fair and logical solution, and I fail to see where the unfairness to either side comes in. But beyond this very limited point I, personally, am not prepared to go. I cannot get it out of my mind&#x2014;noble Lords on this side of the House may say what they like&#x2014;that the Referendum, applied as is suggested by my noble friend, is nothing but a sort of glorified version of that local option which we were always taught to believe one of the most pernicious proposals that ever was made; and when I hear noble Lords expatiating eloquently on the beauty of the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0403"/>
<col>755</col>
system and upon the benefits which it will confer upon this country and how admirably it will work, I cannot help also bearing in mind speeches made by gentlemen holding very different political opinions, who also contend that, worked properly, nothing would suit their purpose better. On these grounds I certainly am not prepared to commit myself without much further consideration to a measure of this kind, which may have very different results from those anticipated by its supporters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01512"><member>THE EARL OF ANCASTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a new member of your Lordships' House I must ask for special indulgence on this occasion because it so happens that I cannot see eve to eye with the noble Marquess who leads this side, and I fear that if the Bill were taken to a Division I should be compelled to vote against it. I must confess that in coming into the atmosphere of this Chamber there is great relief in the feeling that there is no longer any Party force or Party Whip to whip you into the Lobby, and that there is freedom of speech. It is held by some noble Lords that because something may be said in favour of a principle, even if the details are bad, you should vote for the principle. I entirely differ from that view. Take as an instance the case of Home Rule for Ireland. I may be quite convinced that the idea of Irishmen managing their own affairs is in principle excellent, but if the Bill to carry that out is in detail full of things of which I could not possibly approve, then I hold that it is better to sacrifice the principle. As to the Bill introduced by Lord Balfour, I am bound to say that I have not found a single detail to which I am not absolutely opposed.<lb/>
Opinion on the Referendum has grown at a most alarming rate, and it is interesting to review the commencement and the present position of this question. As far as the Conservative Party is concerned, the principle of the Referendum was not adopted as part of their programme until the Albert Hall meeting. Mr. Balfour then announced that the Referendum was the means he would suggest for getting over differences of opinion between the two Houses and for settling deadlocks. There is a great deal to be said in favour of the Referendum being used on those occasions. But it was pointed out, and rightly pointed out, that it would work unfairly for the Liberal Party, that as soon
<col>756</col>
as they were in office there would be perpetual Referendums, but that when the Conservative Party held office there would be no Referendum whatever. Mr. Asquith challenged Mr. Balfour to say whether he would subject Tariff Reform to a Referendum, and the reply given, I believe, was that he would do so if the Liberals would permit Home Rule to be similarly treated. The controversy did not go much further than that at the election.<lb/>
This Bill, however, will carry us like an avalanche over a precipice, because now we have got a great deal further than that. By the main provision of the Bill&#x2014;I refer to Clause 2&#x2014;a Referendum can be granted if it is demanded by a minority of 200 Members in the other Chamber&#x2014;a most dangerous proposal. I do not know the origin of this Bill, whether it is a trial balloon sent up to see which way the wind is blowing, or whether it is introduced by Lord Balfour of Burleigh as the result of his mature consideration and therefore is practically the Bill of a private Member. If it is the Bill of a private Member I can quite understand that in framing it the noble Lord naturally considered that in order that the Bill should be acceptable as a solution of this great Constitutional question it ought to carry the element of fairness to both Parties. I have no doubt he was confronted with the difficulty of framing a measure which would do this, and I therefore conclude that that is the reason for this clause. Not only was the noble Lord confronted with the enormous difficulty of deciding what Bills should be subjected to the Referendum, but with the equally difficult problem as to the size of the minority of the House of Commons which should be allowed to demand a Referendum. The noble Lord told us that he was not wedded to the number of 200. I think that is lucky, for I feel perfectly certain that if a minority of 200 Members of Parliament were accepted as the number the country would be in a perpetual condition similar to that at General Elections.<lb/>
The noble Lord who preceded me referred to the question of Local Option and the direct vote, which has been opposed by the Conservative Party in the past. It has certainly adopted that attitude with regard to the liquor laws; and we have all of us appeared on many platforms and said it is a disgraceful
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0404"/>
<col>757</col>
tyranny that if one man wants a glass of beer he should be prevented from having it because two other people say he should not have it. And that is still my opinion. If the Referendum is to be put into operation on every single petty Bill when demanded by a minority of 200, we should be living in a state of tyranny in this country which could not be supported by a free people. The noble Lord, Lord Balfour, said that he did not believe the Referendum would be frequently used, and that the 200 Members who could demand a Referendum would use that privilege very rarely and with great care. But I cannot agree. The moment a Bill is the least unpopular, I believe that enormous pressure will be put upon those 200 Members. It might, of course, be that there was not a minority of 200 in the House of Commons to demand it, but that is a very exceptional circumstance. It occurred but once in a very large number of years after the Conservative Party had suffered such a severe defeat at the polls. But even if the minority in the House of Commons of the regular Opposition was only, as it was then, some 160 Members, it would be certain to lead to log-rolling and to bargains with other Parties in the House of Commons. A Party finding itself in a small minority would certainly make terms with some other Party&#x2014;perhaps the Irish Nationalist Party or the representatives of the trade unions&#x2014;to obtain support in demanding the Referendum on reciprocal conditions. Therefore, instead of this privilege being used only on rare and special occasions, I believe that it would become a frequent practice, and be fraught with very great danger to this country.<lb/>
And now that Peers are able to take part in General Elections and in electioneering, if this Bill passes I believe that every year, from the beginning of July to the middle of August, we should be engaged in something like a General Election, three village meetings a night, explaining to the electors what a disgraceful Bill it was which was being referred to them, or expressing our entire approval of that Bill. That state of things would be perfectly intolerable, and it would tie up all the electors of this country because there would be this frequent disturbance of things upon, in many cases, minor questions. To those who hold the view that this Referendum would not be frequently used, I would ask them to take
<col>758</col>
the question of Church schools. Let it once be known that a Conservative Opposition had allowed a Bill which dealt drastically with Church schools to go through without demanding a Referendum, and I am sure that at every Church door they would be pilloried as traitors to the cause, as having deserted their faith and religion.<lb/>
I am perfectly certain of this, that if the Referendum is to be worked, it cannot be worked by any such scheme or proposal as that now before your Lordships. When we see the proposals of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the reform of this Chamber and the means for Referendum, it may be found&#x2014;I hope it will&#x2014;only to concern those questions and deal with those points where a deadlock has occurred between the two Houses. Although I acknowledge what was said by the noble Lord opposite, that there is less and less independence amongst Members of the House of Commons, vet I do feel that the introduction into our Constitution of the Referendum, to be largely used, would be a very grave danger, and would be altering the whole form of government under which we have lived for past centuries. I do not believe that a permanent solution of this problem can be found&#x2014;and we all wish to work for a permanent solution&#x2014;in any drastic or far-extending system of Referendum such as has been placed before us.<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke last from the other side of the House was strongly in favour of the Referendum. I rather agree with him from his point of view. I believe that a question such as Home Rule itself would be more likely to be passed under the Referendum than if it were hung up for two or three years, during which time it would be liable to be shot at and to have holes picked in it. I have always felt that if we could be sure that there would be some definite pledge, something written down in our Constitution to the effect that the Parliament Bill, if passed, was not to be altered, some scheme could be found to compromise on those grounds. But as one who was very nearly as long in the House of Commons as the noble Lord who preceded me, my fear arises from the system of curtailment of debate, and allowing measures of taxation to pass through the House of Commons after perhaps one week's discussion. One day you have the First Reading; the Second Reading takes one
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0405"/>
<col>759</col>
day; for the Committee stage, one day; one day for Report, and in a week the Bill is law. Beyond that, I say that the Government scheme can be used, and can be made so that it would not be a delusion and a snare to the electors. If the Parliament Bill is fairly used and fairly worked, I, for one, would be more in favour of it than I would be in favour of such a Referendum as is proposed by this Bill. In conclusion, I do hope, when the Opposition Bill is placed before us in this House, that as regards this question of the Referendum it will only deal with those questions where conflicts arise between the two Houses, as I feel certain that if it becomes the common practice of Parliament to refer every petty question to the people at the demand of a small minority in the House of Commons. it will be the end of Party government and the end of freedom in this country, and absolutely destructive of all our preconceived notions of government.</membercontribution></p>

It is perfectly reasonable that the House should see the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition before being asked to come to a definite decision about this Bill. I am precluded, of course, from discussing the merits on the question of the adjournment, but I would like to say that I should greatly regret if the House were to be precluded from seeing what Amendments would be made upon this Bill by those who are, in principle, in favour of reference to the people. Of course, the last speaker is an open and declared adversary of the whole scheme, just as some noble Lords opposite are, but I think it is only fair that those who are in favour of the principle of reference to the people as a possible means of solving some of our difficulties, should have an opportunity of discussing in detail the
<col>760</col>
provisions of the Bill and of putting down Amendments in order that we may see what the trend of opinion is. The question is undoubtedly one of the greatest possible complexity, and on that ground it is of importance that we should get to the Committee stage and see what the differences of opinion really are. Therefore though I cordially agree to the proposal to adjourn the debate, I hope it will not be understood that that means that the House will not be asked again at a more convenient stage to resume the debate where it has left off to-night.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01518"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask you to give a Second Reading to this Bill because it is to remedy a grievance. There is not sufficient power under the County Councils Act to enable a county council to take over a ferry. I will give your Lordships a distinct instance where there has been great hardship. There are two bridges over the River Trent ten miles apart, and there is a ferry half way between the two bridges which has been in existence for centuries, but at present the ferry has ceased to exist because the riparian owner will not choose to put a boat on it and no deed has been found under which it would be possible for us to compel that riparian owner to take those steps. Neither is there power under the Act to enable the county council in conjunction with other county councils to take over and carry on the ferry. I ought to say that both counties are put to the expense of keeping the county road open to the edge of the river, and although everybody sees a ferry marked on the map, they find, when they get there, only a very little boat, and even that may not always be there. I ask your Lordships, therefore, to admit the principle of this Bill which is that a county council should be enabled either by themselves or in conj unction with a neighbouring county council to take over a ferry and work it, to put on whatever tolls may be necessary, and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0406"/>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01521"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot say that I had very much knowledge of this question before the Bill which the noble Viscount has just introduced was brought to the notice of the House. The noble Viscount has given an example of the inconveniences that arise in certain districts owing to perhaps an old-established ferry very often not being in working order, or where the private owner has taken no steps to work it, or has discontinued working it, the machinery and plant having got into bad order. In such a case the local authority have apparently no power to take over the ferry. I think the noble Viscount has certainly made out a <i>prima facie</i> case for the Bill, and the Government have no intention of opposing it, 'and would be glad to support him in
<col>762</col>
carrying out its principle. A similar Bill was, I understand, introduced in 1905 in another place by Mr. Grant Lawson, but it made no progress, although it was supported by the Local Government Board at that time. I believe that that Bill did not propose that the county council should be the local authority for the purposes of the Bill. There does not, however, seem to be any objection to this proposal. But as a ferry is very often of more purely local utility than of general county utility, I think it would probably he sufficient if the urban district council or the rural district council should be the authority; and if a ferry was serving a larger area the several rural district councils or perhaps the county council with the other local authorities concerned should have power to join to contribute towards the expenses incurred. This is a point which might, perhaps, be considered in Committee. As I have said, the Government have no wish to oppose this Bill. On the contrary, they support it, and although it cannot have widespread application it will prove of utility in certain districts, as is shown by the example which the noble Viscount gave us this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01531">The noble Marquess said: My Lords, in order to induce the House to accept this Motion it is, I think, necessary that I should establish two propositions. The first is that the Bill which we intend to lay upon the Table of this House is a Bill which affects the Royal Prerogative. The second proposition is that it is right and proper in dealing with a Bill of that description that the assent of the Crown should be obtained before its introduction. With regard to the first proposition, I do not think that it will be necessary for me to occupy much of your Lordships' time. It must be obvious to all of those who have watched the Constitutional controversy which has lately been proceeding that any Bill dealing with the reconstitution of this House would be certain to affect the Royal Prerogative. It is a common feature in all schemes of House of Lords reform, certainly in the schemes which have been put forward by our supporters, and I think, even in those. I will hardly say schemes, but suggestions of which we have been sometimes allowed to catch an elusive glimpse, propounded by His Majesty's Government&#x2014;it is common to all those suggestions that a reformed House of Lords must also be a House of Lords very much reduced in numbers If that be so it follows at once that there must be at that point a limitation of the Royal Prerogative. For example, no matter to what figure the reconstituted House might be reduced, it would follow that there must be a certain number of Peers who are at present entitled to receive writs of summons to sit and vote in this House who would no longer be entitled to receive them. It would follow also that any fresh Peerages created by the Sovereign would have to be created upon the condition that the mere possession of a Peerage did not carry with it the right to sit and vote in this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01532">But that is not the only point at which our Bill will touch the Royal Prerogative. I think your Lordships will not differ from me when I say that there is room for almost infinite variety in the treatment of this problem of House of Lords reform; but those who have watched the discussions will not differ from me when I say that there are certain features which every one will expect to find in the kind of Bill which we shall introduce. I think every one will expect to find in our Bill a proposal that the new House shall contain an element consisting of Peers possessing a certain quail-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0408"/>
<col>765</col>
fication, and chosen by your Lordships from amongst the members of this House. I think most people will also expect to find that the reconstituted House ought, in our view, to contain a nominated element. Besides that, I think they will be prepared to find that there will under our proposals be an element elected from outside the House, through machinery which will be in direct relation with popular opinion We believe that the House can be reconstituted upon the kind of lines which I have indicated in such a manner as to produce a highly efficient; Second Chamber, and also a Second Chamber in which political parties will be much more evenly balanced than they are at present, a condition which I believe is regarded as indispensable by all House of Lords reformers. But, my Lords, it is surely obvious that no useful purpose could he served by establishing a balance of this kind if it were to remain possible for the Crown, on the advice of the Ministers of the day, deliberately to upset that balance by a large additional creation of Peers, and I therefore submit that at that point also it will be necessary for us to make proposals which will undoubtedly have the effect of restricting the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. I have said enough I think to show the House that at certain points it is inevitable that our Bill will involve some interference with the Royal Prerogative.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01533">I now pass to the other question, whether it is necessary in dealing with a Bill of that kind that the assent of the Sovereign should be received before the Bill is introduced into your Lordships' House. As to this we have naturally done what we could to satisfy ourselves in regard to the precedents which have a bearing on the case under examination, and I will with the permission of the House refer very briefly to one or two of them I find in the first place the precedent which was created as long ago as the year 1719 in the reign of George I when a Bill dealing with the question of the Peerage was introduced by the Sunderland Ministry. The motive with which that Bill was introduced was not so much to interfere with the right of the then Sovereign to create Peers, but to render it impossible for his successor by the creation of Peerages to overwhelm the Whig majority which was then to be found in this House. The introduction of that Bill was preceded by an Address to the Crown. The King gave his consent, and intimated that&#x2014;
<col>766</col>
<quote>"he has so much at heart the settling the Peerage of the whole Kingdom upon such a foundation as may secure the freedom and constitution of Parliament in all future ages that he is willing that his Prerogative stand not in the way of so great and necessary a work."</quote>
Your Lordships' House then passed the Bill, but it was rejected in the House of Commons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01534">I proceed to cite another case that occurred at a much later date, the case of the Bill of 1844 dealing with the dioceses of St. Asaph and Bangor. The introduction of that Bill, which undoubtedly affected the Prerogative of the Crown, was not preceded by any Address. The Bill passed its Second Reading in this House, and it was only on the Third Reading that the Duke of Wellington pointed out that the Prerogative of the Crown was involved, and said that the King would not be advised to give his consent to the Bill. There was an interesting discussion, in the course of which the Lord Chancellor (Lord Lyndhurst) expressed a doubt whether he ought to put the Bill to the House, and suggested the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the question. In the discussion which followed Lord Cottenham and Lord Campbell laid it down that questions involving the interests of the Crown could not be even debated without the consent of the Sovereign. A Committee was appointed, and reported that the consent of the Crown was certainly necessary, although it might be given at various stages. Eventually the Bill was withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01535">The next case which I have to mention is that of the Irish Peerage Bill of 1868 A Bill was introduced in the House of Commons in that year by Sir Colman O' Loghlen dealing with the Irish Peerage, and in that case, as in the former one which I mentioned, no previous Address was moved to the Crown. On the Second Reading Mr. Gathorne-Hardy for the then Government refused to advise the Crown to consent and Speaker Denison ruled that the Bill could not pass the Third Reading until the Royal consent had been obtained. The Bill was thereupon withdrawn. The precedents up to this point, while they show that the concurrence of the Crown is essential in the case of Bills dealing with the Royal Prerogative, certainly seem to suggest that that consent may be obtained, not necessarily before the introduction of a Bill, but at any stage in its progress through the two Houses of Parliament.</p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0409"/>
<col>767</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01536">I now come to a later and a much more important precedent, and one which I think your Lordships will regard as bearing very materially upon the matter which we are now discussing. It arose in connection with Mr. Gladstone's proposed legislation in the year 1868 for the Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland. In the month of May of that year Mr. Gladstone moved three Resolutions. The first declared that the Established Church should cease to exist in Ireland, the second that it was expedient that the exercise of public patronage in relation to the Established Church of Ireland should cease, and the third ran thus&#x2014;
<quote>"That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty humbly to pray that with a view to preventing by legislation during the present session the creation of new personal interests through the exercise of any public patronage Her Majesty would be graciously pleased to place at the disposal of Parliament her interest in the temporalities of the Archbishoprics, Bishoprics, and other ecclesiastical dignities and benefices in Ireland and in the custody thereof."</quote>
In moving his Resolutions Mr. Gladstone, who at that time was still in Opposition, dwelt particularly on his desire that the most careful regard should be had to regularity in dealing with these matters. He used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"I am aware that, according to the rules of the house of Commons, it would be competent to a member to introduce into the House, with leave from the House, a Bill which might affect the rights of the Crown without the previous assent of the Crown having been obtained. Such things have been done on certain occasions by a Government when it has happened, from the smallness of the subject matter or from inadvertence, that notice has not been taken of the fact previous to the introduction of the Bill." And again, Mr. Gladstone said, "Bills of that nature have been introduced by individuals not belonging to the Government even when they were Bills to which the Government did not assent and have been passed through certain of their stages without the giving of that assent on the part of the Crown."</quote>
He went on, however, to say that&#x2014;
<quote>"In this instance the case is different. The interest of the Crown in this case is not merely a proprietary interest, but one of wide and far-reaching import. And also this is a Bill which, although it is not proposed by the Government, would be, I may say, proposed on behalf of a very large proportion of the members of this House acting together generally in its support. That being so, I have felt that it was my duty not to claim the entire liberty which the House has accorded to its members, but to ask the House to present an Address requesting the assent of the Crown and allowing us to deliberate upon this subject before any Motion be made in the House for the introduction of the Bill."</quote>
<col>768</col>
That statement of Mr. Gladstone's seems to us to sum up with admirable clearness what ought to be regarded as the law and practice of Parliament in dealing with these Bills in which the Royal Prerogative is concerned. Mr. Gladstone having made that statement, Mr. Disraeli, for the Government, intimated that&#x2014;
<quote>"when these Resolutions have been properly passed, they will be dealt with after clue consideration by the Government, and Her Majesty will be properly advised with respect to them."</quote>
The Queen's consent was subsequently intimated, and the Bill dealing with the temporalities of the Irish Church, and known as the Suspensory Bill, was passed by the House of Commons It was, your Lordships will remember, rejected in this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01537">I will only refer to one other case, a more recent one, which also deals with the question of the Peerage. I find that in the year 1875 Lord Stanhope, in order to prepare the way for a Bill dealing with the Irish Peerage which he intended to bring in, moved a humble Address to the Crown begging Her Majesty to renounce her undoubted prerogative of creating Irish Peers The form of the Motion was objected to by Lord Cairns, and the wording of it was subsequently amended so as to make it run thus&#x2014;
<quote>"An Address praying Her Majesty that the power conferred on her under the Act of Union for the creation of Irish Peers may not stand in the way of the consideration by Parliament of any measure relating thereto that may be introduced."</quote>
To that Address a reply from the Crown was received in which it was stated that Her Majesty did not desire that the powers reserved to her by the Act of Union should stand in the way of the consideration by Parliament of any measure that might be introduced on the subject. I cite this case because it is the most recent and because it appears to show that at that time this was considered the proper and usual mode of dealing with a Bill affecting the Prerogative of the Crown.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01538">May I sum up in half a dozen words the conclusions which these precedents suggest to us? They seem to us to suggest that it is certainly a breach of the law of Parliament to pass through either House a Bill affecting the Prerogative of the Crown without the assent of the Crown. I do not
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0410"/>
<col>769</col>
think any one will dispute that. We also conclude from these precedents that, although this assent may be signified at any stage, it is the proper course to obtain it before the introduction of the Bill. But we draw this further conclusion in reference to cases where the Bill is introduced, or is sought to be introduced, not by the Government, but by the Opposition The case of the introduction of such a Bill by the Opposition is clearly a different case from the introduction of a similar Bill by the Government, because it is perfectly fair to assume that if the Government makes itself responsible for the Bill it can at any moment count upon the assent of the Crown. That, of course, is not true when the Bill is moved from the Opposition side of the House, and it certainly does not seem fair and reasonable that, in such a case, a Bill should not only be introduced, but, perhaps, carried through several stages and laboriously debated under conditions which would expose the movers of the Bill to find themselves estopped by the Government, who would only have to signify, at whatever moment might seem fit to them, that the Royal Assent was riot likely to be forthcoming.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01539">We therefore draw the conclusion that if a Bill affecting the Royal Prerogative is brought forward by the Opposition it is indispensable that the Royal Assent should be signified before the Bill has been actually introduced, and, my Lords, that is the course which we propose, with the permission of the House, to adopt this evening. I venture to express my hope that that course will meet with the approval of both sides of the House, and that it will be regarded as a course consistent with the respect which is due to the Crown, in accordance with the best traditions of Parliament, and certainly as the course which would be for the general convenience of your Lordships' House. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Marquess used a curious expression as to us who sit on this side, as to His Majesty's Government. He said even we, from the elusive glimpses that your Lordships have been able to obtain of what we want will probably have some proposals that would touch the Prerogative of the Crown. "Elusive glimpses" struck me as a very curious phrase considering the observations the noble Marquess himself made and the short hints he gave us of what will be the Bill which we have waited for so long, which we shall welcome, and which we shall expect with so much interest. "Elusive glimpses&#x0021;" It is a matter of common knowledge that the Referendum has been part&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01542"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am very reluctant to interrupt the noble Viscount, but he will remember that in that part of my observations I was dealing with proposals to reduce the number of the House. I said that that proposal was common to schemes which had been proposed on this side, and that I believed that any scheme which had been suggested on the other side also contemplated a reduction in the numbers of the House. That was my argument.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01543"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I do not deny that for a moment, and I do not wish to press the point; but the phrase "elusive glimpses" caught my ear, because it is a matter of common knowledge that for a considerable time the Referendum found favour with the party opposite. Important statesmen sitting on that Bench have been advocating Referendum in the country, and yet Referendum, the moment it ceases, to be an elusive glimpse and takes the more useful shape
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0411"/>
<col>771</col>
of a Bill, vanishes and proves to be an elusive glimpse indeed.<lb/>
I pass to the more serious second proposition of the noble Marquess. He said a few days ago, when he first mentioned this Motion, that the time was short for proceeding with it to-day. I make no complaint of that. The time has been rather short, but we, like the noble Marquess himself, have made the best use of that time. Our collection of precedents, and our reading of them, does not, I think, vary very much, if at all, from the reading of the noble Marquess. I was glad to note at the end of his remarks that the noble Marquess drew a difference, which is no doubt of great importance, between Motions made in reference to Bills moved by Ministers of the Crown and those moved either by private members, as I think Lord Stanhope was at that time, or by members of the official Opposition. There are one or two precedents which, perhaps, the House will allow me to add to the list of the noble Marquess. In 1833 a famous Bill which the noble Marquess has often heard of, I am sure, was mentioned in the King's Speech&#x2014;a measure dealing with the Church temporalities in Ireland. The King's Assent to the financial proposals in that Bill was not signified until the House went into Committee. On that famous occasion objection was taken on the Second Reading that the King had not formally placed his interest at the disposal of Parliament, and a communication to that effect was afterwards made in order to meet the view which the noble Marquess is now pressing.<lb/>
Then there was the case of the St. Asaph and Bangor Bishopric. The noble Marquess described that, so far as I can judge, with perfect accuracy, but he did not mention that the Committee which this House appointed to search the precedents made a report and that report came to this: That no effective and guiding precedents could be found. Those proceedings are all to be found on page 449 of Sir Erskine May. Here is a smaller affair which the noble Marquess omitted, justifiably enough. In 1866 there was a Second Reading of a small Bill called the Blackwater Bridge Bill. The point was raised that the Crown's interest in sonic of the proprietary rights would be affected if that Bill became law. The point was pressed that the
<col>772</col>
Queen's Assent to the passage of the Bill had not been signified, and the result was that the Speaker declined to put the question. That, again, is more or less on the noble Marquess's side. On Sir Colman O'Loghlen's Peerages (Ireland) Bill, which was withdrawn on Second Reading, it was intimated that Her Majesty's consent had not been given.<lb/>
With the noble Marquess's account of the transactions in the Irish Church case of Mr. Gladstone, the details of which are so well known to many noble Lords now sitting in this House, I have nothing to quarrel with. I should not have expected to have any reason to quarrel with his version of a transaction so well known and so familiar. But I would point out this difference between the Address moved by Mr. Gladstone and the Motion of the noble Marquess. What Mr. Gladstone wanted was that during the interval between the Resolution and the passage of the Bill which he hoped to bring in and get through Parliament no new and fresh interests in the Church of Ireland should be created. He aimed there at a perfectly definite, substantial, practical, and actual object. The noble Marquess's Motion is different in character from that. I am not complaining of it on that account. I am only remarking on it as we are considering the Constitutional question. His Motion does not concern material practical interests of the kind that were dealt with in Mr. Gladstone's Resolution. It is a considerable difference, and the time may come some day or another when it may be a difference with real substance in it. I will not dwell on the point whether it is or is not necessary, or more comformable to such precedents as we can find, that this Assent of the Sovereign should be procured and intimated before the introduction of the Bill, or at some later stage. So far as I can make out, the precedents show that what was said by Lord Cottenham and Lord Campbell was that it was immaterial at what stage the Assent of the Crown was given to a Bill. The only necessity, I gather, was that it should be gained before the Bill was submitted to the Sovereign for assent.<lb/>
It is not necessary, however, to-night for me to express any opinion as to the Constitutional question&#x2014;whether it is or is not necessary to procure the Assent of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0412"/>
<col>773</col>
the Crown before the introduction of the Bill. I am not disposed to ask whether it might not have been more convenient to have postponed this Address which the noble Marquess has moved to a later stage of the Bill, which we have not yet seen and of which we have had only glimpses, elusive or otherwise. I think it would have been more convenient, but it is not a point worth quarrelling about. I will only say quite frankly that the course which the noble Marquess has thought it his duty to take seems to us to be a justifiable course.<lb/>
The Government have no desire whatever to place any technical difficulty or formality&#x2014;if formality it be&#x2014;in the way of the introduction and discussion in this House of the Bill which the noble Marquess promises. We shall offer our advice to the Sovereign to assent to the prayer of the noble Marquess's Address. Of course, the noble Marquess was justified in referring to legislative projects of his own. Perhaps I may be permitted to add that it will be distinctly recognised that this assent to the proposal of the noble Marquess does not pledge us, the Government, in any way as to the future advice that it might be our duty to offer to the Sovereign whenever the proper time comes for our advice to be sought or given. We are neither expressing nor even intimating any opinion as to that advice. We reserve complete freedom of action. I will only say that, whatever discussion may take place in your Lordships' House on any proposals for altering the constitution of this House, or for affecting the constitution of the House of Lords, or for affecting the prerogatives and power of the Crown&#x2014;the Government in assenting to that have no intention whatever of being parties to any postponement of their own proposals embodied in the Parliament Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01544"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hoped rather than expected that the answer of the noble Viscount to the Motion of the noble Marquess would have been somewhat (Efferent. I should have been glad had the noble Viscount seen his way to refuse the concurrence of the Government to the proposition of the noble Marquess. For I have always been stoutly opposed, and shall always be stoutly opposed, to a great proposition for Constitutional reform emanating from any
<col>774</col>
private member, however distinguished he may be, or, indeed, from any source except that of the Government itself. What is the use of bringing forward a measure which you know that by no possibility can you carry into law? It may have strategical advantages&#x2014;of those I am no judge. But I believe it to be a great mistake to launch a scheme of this kind. however perfect it may be, which you cannot carry into effect until you are seated on the Government Benches, and which, therefore, is only in the nature of an air-balloon floating perhaps front this House, but which certainly will come to the usual aeronautical catastrophe in the other, and which will therefore remain only as a pledge of your ideas and a your intentions, which were, I think, amply set forth during the debates on the Resolutions of this House last year. I submit this further inconvenience, that this scheme cannot satisfy everybody, however perfect it may be. As a matter of fact, it is not likely to satisfy many. A scheme for a reform of the House of Lords&#x2014;a task of such enormous difficulty and complexity&#x2014;should not, I humbly submit, be put forward except by a Government endowed with a majority and with the authority of Government and supported by a loyal majority and so able to carry its plan, whatever its imperfections may be, into effect.<lb/>
For that reason, my Lords, I do not welcome, although I am a Referendum man in a limited sense, the effort of my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in the private position which he holds, to introduce a measure dealing with that enormous question. Laudable as that effort was, I do not think upon the whole the result can altogether have been reassuring to others who are preparing great schemes of Constitutional reform and who occupy private positions in this House. So much I am bound to say. I have said it often enough in speeches on House of Lords reform already. Nothing has occurred to change my views. But I feel bound to state them at this early stage of the proceedings. I should add also that I do not think that the precedents set out by my noble friend quite supported his contention that it was a necessary precedent to the Bill to move this Address. The only one, I think, which is absolutely on all fours with his proposal is that of my uncle, Lord Stanhope, whom I well remember
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0413"/>
<col>775</col>
introducing the Bill in question. He was a private member, but he was proposing a Constitutional measure of a much more limited scope than that which is adumbrated by the noble Marquess. Even the one of Mr. Gladstone with regard to the Suspensory Bill, which I am old enough to have voted for in this House, is not, I think, on all fours with the course which the noble Marquess proposes to adopt, because in the case of Mr. Gladstone it was not a matter of prerogative, but a matter of patronage, and there is a broad distinction between the two. Mr. Gladstone wanted to nip the Irish Church in the bud the very moment that he was moving his Resolutions. He was naturally anxious that no further interests should be created which would prejudice the reform when it came before the House in detailed form.<lb/>
I do not quarrel with all that, and I do not honestly see what particular advantage is gained by the Address put forward at this particular juncture; but I am very grateful to my noble friend for bringing it forward because he used a phrase which goes further and deeper than the Address which he is moving to-night, when he spoke of the elusive glimpse which he, and so far as I know he alone, has been able to obtain of the scheme of His Majesty's Government in this matter. That is really the vital point. What my noble friend may produce, however powerfully it may be supported in this part of the Souse, can have no permanent bearing or effect on the question. What we have a right to ask&#x2014;and I do not suppose for one moment we shall get an answer&#x2014;is, when the scheme which has been adumbrated in the Preamble of the Parliament Bill is likely to be laid before Parliament. That is the vital matter; that is the crux of the whole problem. I welcome to-night the ample and genial presence of my friend the noble Viscount opposite (Lord Haldane)&#x2014;the last of the long line of Viscounts with which His Majesty's Government have enriched this House&#x2014;who, I know, is an ardent supporter of the Preamble, or so I gather from his speech in the House of Commons; I welcome him here, and I hope that in some moment of new-born confidence, on finding himself in this fresh atmosphere, he may see fit to impart all that he knows or has any authority to impart on that subject.<lb/>
I have listened very attentively and with great interest during the last two nights to
<col>776</col>
the debate raised by Lord Balfour. But there was a certain unreality about it. We are in the midst of a Constitutional crisis, the most serious in my humble judgment, and as my noble friend the President of the Council justly said, with which any of us can have been face to face; the most serious, perhaps, which has occurred in this country since the great contest which ended in the fall of the Monarchy and the rise of the Protectorate. I am not exaggerating. People outside may not see&#x2014;and I am astonished that they do not see&#x2014;the gravity of the change which is taking place&#x2014;the revolution which His Majesty's Government are endeavouring to bring about. The papers are filled with the details of the Coronation, with football matches, with contests at golf, and a few race meetings perhaps&#x2014;and perhaps they are not the worst part of the newspapers&#x2014;but I see hardly a word in those massive publications which indicates the slightest interest on the part of this nation, which is so deeply affected, and likely to be so much more affected in the future, in the great transformation, the great revolution which is proceeding under their eyes at this moment. I am not one of those who say that' a mere change in the Constitution of the House of Lords would be in any shape a revolution. I think it would more likely be a beneficent reform. But I do say that the course pursued by the Government is nothing less than a course of revolution, because it is an attempt to change the whole of the relations between the two Houses, to obliterate this House as it is now sitting, and to substitute nothing whatever in its place.<lb/>
Was there ever in the civilised world such a state of things as exists in this country now, when the Government are proposing to sweep away&#x2014;as they can sweep away by their power&#x2014;a House of coeval antiquity or greater antiquity than the House of Commons, and to substitute nothing&#x2014;not the slightest check, not the slightest control over the proceedings of that House? My noble friend opposite told us the other day of the representatives of all parts of the Empire being summoned to the Imperial Conference. I forget what inference he drew from it. The inference which I draw is that our fellow-citizens in the Britains beyond the seas are likely to depart from this country with their respect for its institutions, its Party system, and its Government sensibly diminished by what they will have seen&#x2014;a Government which has endowed
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0414"/>
<col>777</col>
every one of the Dominions with a bicameral Constitution, in the act of obliterating that bicameral system at home, so that where there were formerly two Chambers to whose assent every law had to be submitted, there will be one Chamber, whose assent alone will be required, and by the side of it a sheet of paper on which the Government can write whatever they choose&#x2014;a sheet of paper in the shape of a preamble which promises something which so far as we know you are not prepared to perform. I am not accusing my noble friends opposite of bad faith, but I am perfectly certain that they are supported, or rather propelled, by a triumvirate majority in the House of Commons, who will not allow them, even if they wished to carry these promises into effect. So that, what our fellow subjects from the outer Britains will see is a single Chamber, a potent House of Commons, and by its side an I O U, a <i>post obit</i>, which probably you do not intend to honour.<lb/>
This, after all, is the crux of the matter. Are you going to attempt simply a one-sided revolution, or are you going to attempt to settle this great question by the co-operation of all the great Parties in the State? The one is a statesmanlike course; the other is a partisan course. I know very well&#x2014;it was constantly boasted of in the discussion last night&#x2014;that you have gained a considerable majority at the polls, and I quite admit that at both of the General Elections of last year there was condemnation of the hereditary Legislature as at present constituted. But do those verdicts go beyond that? Was there anything in either verdict which implied that the country, having had the issue fairly and deliberately laid before it, wished to be governed by single-Chamber government? My noble friend the Minister for Agriculture, who I do not think felt the gravity of the question so acutely as my friend the President of the Council did, with that boisterous good-humour which is one of the assets of the House, said that the country had determined at the last election to restore the balance of the Constitution. Heaven help the country if it thought that that was what it was doing&#x0021; He said, moreover, that the country was determined not to reform your Lordships' House at the present time. Will the noble Earl explain whence he elicited that information? I confess that I read a great many speeches in the country at that time, and I saw nothing to confirm those statements. I have no reason to believe that the country

wishes to be governed by a single Chamber or would not be glad to see the House of Lords reformed. I have no opportunity of judging where my noble friend derived his impression or got his facts but I question them altogether. After all, the great advantage claimed&#x2014;and justly claimed&#x2014;by Lord Balfour for his Bill was that on a great Constitutional issue, when submitted to the country, you do obtain a clear unmistakable answer to a question with reference to a particular subject. A General Election is, after all, nothing but a confused. clamour of voices. No one can tell exactly on what question one constituency gives its verdict and on what question another decides in favour of a particular candidate, and my contention is that from these General Elections you have no right to infer&#x2014;and I believe you would be wrong in inferring&#x2014;that the country approves of the obliteration of the Second Chamber, as now constituted, without substituting anything for it.<lb/>
My noble friend the President of the Council had the courage&#x2014;I will not say the audacity, for he certainly had the right&#x2014;to appeal to Burke as being more conversant with that author than any one else here, and having written the best book about him; but I confess I thought his quotation somewhat daring, because I think the impartial person who applied the term "rashness" to the man who interfered, with the works of a watch without knowing how to put them together again would have applied that term rather to the noble Viscount and the Government of which he is a member than to any partial attempts on this side of the House. My noble friend perhaps will agree that I could find half a dozen passages in which Burke eulogises, with rapture never perhaps equalled, the blessings of our Constitution&#x2014;King, Lords, and Commons, or King, Second Chamber, and Commons, if you like. It was his ideal. The noble Viscount will remember, and I dare say could repeat at this moment, that glorious passage of Burke in which he compares the Monarchy of England to the Castle of Windsor, surrounded by its double battlements of Lords and Commons, and in which he concludes his glowing eulogy by saying, "As long as these three forces are joined together no man need tremble for his liberty, his property, or his security. Once dissolve that bond and all security is gone." If my noble friend appeals to Burke, to
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0415"/>
<col>779</col>
Burke he shall go, and I do not think he will find anything reassuring as regards his present course in the works of the greatest philosopher of that time.<lb/>
I have asked a question, but I am afraid that I shall not get an answer from my noble friends opposite. Are they prepared to give us more than an elusive glimpse&#x2014;any assurance at all with respect to the Second Chamber which they have solemnly pledged themselves through the mouth of the late King and by their own Preamble to their Bill to establish in lieu of the present Chamber? I venture to think that though they may not give an answer now, yet at a time that is not so remote as we may think they will he obliged to give an answer. I do not think so meanly of my countrymen as to believe that they will not insist on knowing what is the policy of the Government with regard to this vital matter. After all, every one of my noble friends opposite on that Bench knows as well as I do, knows as well as everybody in this House knows it&#x2014;aye, as well as every thinking person outside this House knows it&#x2014;that you cannot achieve a settlement of this question on these lines. You can achieve a Party triumph. You can avenge on this House the wrongs&#x2014;real in many cases and sometimes fancied&#x2014;you have received at its hands. Having done that by Party, you will only have done what is reversible by Party. When this Party come into power&#x2014;as come they must, unless the pendulum has absolutely ceased to vibrate&#x2014;when this Party come in will they not make it their first task to uproot that which you have rashly planted in the rocks by the wayside, without root, without hold upon the ground?<lb/>
My Lords, I have been allied by personal friendship for many years with almost all the leaders of this Government. I hope that they will not allow their names to be associated with&#x2014;they will not set their seal to&#x2014;a policy of this kind. I appeal directly to my friend the noble Viscount opposite. He bears a famous name, an honoured name, a respected name. Will he let it go down to posterity allied with a one-sided, fanatical, and partisan settlement like this? I appeal to my right hon. friend at the head of the Government, who has to settle with history and posterity the great claims his intellect gives him to be a conspicuous figure in the history of this
<col>780</col>
country. How will they stand when their names are at last produced before that great tribunal from whose verdict there can be no appeal if they have conspired with hot-headed fanatics to lay hands on this immemorial Constitution, rashly awl recklessly, without having done anything to build, but only to destroy?</membercontribution></p>

<col>781</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01556"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my first Amendment is to leave out paragraph (<i>a</i>). Since the noble Earl introduced this Bill a fortnight ago public interest in it has been a good deal roused, and some of us have taken what care we could to get the opinion of experts on the matter. We have also approached some of the gentlemen who sat on the Employment of Children Act Committee in 1910, and others having much knowledge on the subject have been taken into counsel. I quite appreciate the noble Earl's motives in bringing forward this Bill and do not by any means differ from him lightly. Still I think his Bill goes a good deal too far; hence my Amendments to-day.<lb/>
The object of Lord Shaftesbury's Bill appears to be (1) to absolutely prevent street trading by any boy under seventeen or girl under eighteen, and to remove from local authorities their power, under Section 2 of the Act of 1903, to make by-laws for the regulation of street trading by persons under sixteen; and (2) to couple the administration of the Employment of Children Act with the duties of the local authority as local education authority. Now what do the Amendments standing in my name on the Paper do? First, my proposed new clause confines this Bill to thickly populated boroughs and urban districts; secondly, it says that the local authorities <i>must</i>, not may, issue licences to street traders in their districts and regulate the conditions of such licences; thirdly, it says that street trading by girls under eighteen can be absolutely prohibited&#x2014;with this exception, that neither boys nor girls over the age of eleven can be prevented from trading in the streets in company with and under the direction of their parents; and, fourthly, it leaves the power already existing under the 1903 Act for boys and girls over the age of eleven to trade in the streets as heretofore.<lb/>
I have confined the Bill to thickly populated urban districts and to large boroughs because I felt that as regards country districts street trading was not a vital matter, and that there was not much to be said against street trading in country districts. Children there chiefly deliver newspapers and milk, and likely enough they are employed in taking farm produce to markets, which might be called street trading but with which I am sure your Lordships do not wish to interfere. I have
<col>782</col>
made it imperative upon authorities to issue licences because, while some authorities, notably in London, have issued licences and look after street trading, there are other authorities that have not issued licences and do nothing at all in the matter. The power which is given in my proposed new clause to local authorities, if they think fit, to absolutely prohibit street trading by girls under eighteen, I do not suppose will often have to be put into force, but I have thought it well that there should be this power as a protection to these girls; but, as I have said, I make the exception that children who trade in company with their parents are to be allowed to continue to trade. Girls are very often useful, I am given to understand, in helping their parents at stalls in the streets, with costermongers' barrows and so forth, and in my opinion they are quite safe under the immediate protection of their parents.<lb/>
My most important provision, of course, is the one which leaves the power already existing under the 1903 Act for children over the age of eleven to trade in the streets. On looking at the statistics I find this rather curious fact, that in London there are 10,400 street traders between the ages of eleven and fourteen and 3,300 between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. The school age generally terminates at about fourteen. Therefore the statistics show that school children trade, and that when they leave school at the age of fourteen they cease to trade in the streets to anything like the same extent and get regular employment. Therefore this street trading is generally done by school children who cannot get regular work while attending school. What harm is there in children after school hours selling papers or fruit or matches in the streets? If they were not doing that, what would they be doing? Would they be doing anything better? I doubt it. And it must further be remembered that the money which they thus earn is supremely, nay tragically, necessary. As I informed your Lordships on the Second Reading of the Bill, the balance-sheet of many poor families in London shows that never is the housewife able to spend as much as 3<i>d</i> a day on the food of each individual member of the family, and therefore if the child earns a few pence in this way the money is of extreme importance. The hours are not long, for most of the newspaper sales take
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0417"/>
<col>783</col>
place between four and seven in the evening, while the extra pence that are brought home are a welcome addition to the small sum available for the purchase of food. There are no fewer than 40,000 boys and 3,945 girls engaged in this street trading, so that the boys are ten times as many as the girls. I have tried to make the reasons for my proposed new clause as clear as possible, and having said so much I beg to move the first Amendment that stands in my name.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01558"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am sure your Lordships will agree that the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment has the interests of street traders at heart, and endeavoured to obtain as much accurate information upon it as possible; but your Lordships will also have gathered that the Amendment he is now proposing really strikes at the root of the Bill to which you gave a Second Reading a fortnight ago. It will be apparent to your Lordships that the thing hinges entirely upon whether we are to make street trading by young children a Statutory prohibition or leave to local authorities the power of regulating it by by-laws. I endeavoured on the Second Reading of the Bill to make it quite clear that local authorities have, in some instances, exercised their powers rigidly and exceedingly well, but, in the vast majority of cases, whilst by-laws have been drawn up according to the Statute they have not been enforced as well as they might have been, and in some cases no by-laws whatever have been drawn up. I think it is conclusive that local option&#x2014;and by local option I mean the power of local authorities to draw up by-laws&#x2014;has proved a failure in this matter, and upon that point hinges the whole of my case.<lb/>
I do not know that I need go back to the Second Reading debate, and explain further the details. If your Lordships will read the evidence, you will see from the Report of the Departmental Committee that they were agreed that the law as it stands at present, allowing local authorities to make by-laws, had failed. It may interest your Lordships upon that point to hear the statements made at a great conference held the other day upon street trading by
<col>784</col>
children. Sir John Gorst, who, as you all know, is an authority upon this question, said that the present permissive law had not produced its effect, and the time had now come for compulsion. The President of the National Union of Teachers deplored the fact that so many children were engaged in street trading, and said he would welcome restriction or compulsion. I do not think I need say more upon that point, because it is obvious that something must be done either to prohibit street trading or to make the by-laws more rigid. In my opinion prohibition of street trading should become the law of the land.<lb/>
I do not think I can avoid mentioning the further Amendments standing in the noble Lord's name, because they all hang together. Your Lordships will notice that the noble Lord has thought it wise to confine his Amendments to municipal boroughs with a population of over 10,000 and urban districts with a population of over 20,000. Let me point out to you the effect of that. It means, according to the Census of 1901, that 108 boroughs out of 248, and 745 urban districts out of 806, would be excluded; and also all the villages, which number many thousands. Taking all the boroughs, county boroughs, and municipal councils in England and Wales, there is a total of 1,122, and of those only 269 will be included, so that over seventy-six per cent. of the towns of England and Wales will be deprived of the powers they already have under the principal Act of 1903. I do not know whether the noble Lord realises that the effect of his Amendment will be that in those towns which are excluded by his Amendment there will be no by-laws or statutory prohibition whatsoever controlling the street trading question.<lb/>
Your Lordships will admit that that is not amending the law. I think it is bordering on ruining what exists at present. If the noble Lord really wishes to amend the law, I think he had better try and see if he cannot include some of these very important towns. There are heaps of small towns in England with under 20,000 population where street trading by-laws are absolutely necessary, and where there would be no restrictions whatsoever if this Amendment were carried. I admit that under the Amendment we have certain advantages over what now exists. There is power given to prohibit girls trading in the streets at least up to the age of eighteen. The noble
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0418"/>
<col>785</col>
Lord has there raised the age from sixteen to seventeen to eighteen years, which is a distinct advance; but if street trading is an evil, and I believe the consensus of evidence goes to prove that, surely it would be wiser inasmuch as the present law has failed, to amend the law by prohibiting street trading altogether, and so make quite certain that children shall not be led into temptation in the way they are at present. Your Lordships will notice that I propose to mitigate the hardship to a certain extent by allowing those children over the age of eleven who at present have licences under the local authority to continue to trade, but, no new child when he comes to the age of eleven would be allowed to street trade. That, I think, will mitigate the hardship to a large extent. It allows a longer time for the transition stage; and, further, it does not deprive any particular child of anything which has already been allowed. I hope your Lordships will take that into consideration, and will support me in asking the noble Lord to withdraw his Amendment, which strikes at the root principle of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01559"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it does seem to me that this is a question which ought to be considered with a great deal of care. It is very fine for us to indulge in cheap philanthropy in this House, and decide, in accordance with an ideal condition of things, that boys who have not attained a certain age should not trade in the streets. Your Lordships will have to consider this fact, that a large number of these boys are from very respectable homes, and that the money which they earn is extremely necessary to the families themselves. That is why it does seem. to me that this is eminently a question on which we should proceed on the lines, not of rigid rules of prohibition, but of elasticity, and that can only be carried out by a system of local option, the localities themselves having a voice in the matter. Lord Shaftesbury considers that it will mitigate matters that boys who now have licences will under the Bill be allowed to continue trading. It does not seem to me that that would have the effect of making things seem fairer or more just as regards the poorer members of the population. Here is one boy who has been able to trade and bring money home; he is allowed to continue. The boy of another family, living perhaps next door and equally poor, is not allowed to trade. Under those
<col>786</col>
circumstances we ought to act with very great care in this matter. After all, the best people to decide these questions are the people who reside in the locality, and I am sure that is a much safer and sounder system than to impose a rigid law of prohibition applicable to the whole country. As regards trading in the country, in many cases a small stationer employs boys to distribute his papers as part of his business, and it seems to me rather absurd to say that boys in that case receive any harm from going about on bicycles to deliver newspapers. I would also remind your Lordships that even hi large suburban districts it would be really impossible for people in many cases to get their newspapers delivered unless you had sonic system of that kind. In these circumstances if this Amendment goes to a Division I must support the noble Lord who has introduced it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01560"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was very surprised to hear the interpretation which the noble Earl in charge of the Bill put on the Amendment which has been introduced by my noble friend behind me. I understand that the effect of that Amendment is, first, to exclude rural areas from the provisions of the Bill, and, second, to oblige local authorities to make by-laws in urban districts. I should have thought that the fact that that was obligatory would effect the purpose which the promoters of the Bill are desirous of achieving.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01561"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to interrupt the noble Lord, but if he will look through the list of Amendments he will see that by them Section 2 of the principal Act will be repealed, and if that section is repealed it means that in all urban districts of under 20,000 inhabitants and in all rural districts of under 10,000 inhabitants no by-laws or any Statutory prohibition whatever can be drawn up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01562"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: I do not wish to quarrel with the noble Earl as to his interpretation of the Act of 1903. But in the enormous tome of evidence produced by the Select Committee, out of, I think, ninety-eight witnesses, there was only one&#x2014;the Medical Officer of Essex&#x2014;who gave any evidence with regard to rural districts. I think he referred to one rural district, the district of Epping, which I should not have thought was the most typical rural district in England. He admitted that
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0419"/>
<col>787</col>
there was very little street trading, and very little of this employment, except on farms, and it is on that gentleman's evidence that this law is to be applied to the whole kingdom. It seems to be the most flimsy evidence on which to hang such a very large Bill, and it is directly contrary to the evidence of Sir Edward Troup, who told the Committee that this was essentially a town problem. In those circumstances I hope that the noble Earl will not reject at any rate that part of my noble friend's Amendment which refers to rural districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01563"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, says that this Amendment involves the principle of the Bill. I shall be prepared to join issue with him on that point. It is very easy to make these regulations for people whom personally we know very little about, but you have no right to take that action unless you have an overwhelming case for it. In this case you had a Committee appointed and you had the whole matter discussed, and it is now being discussed by people who are well fed and well clothed and well housed, and who are prepared to say, as the noble Earl said, that what is proposed represents an ideal condition of things. They would like to see children doing this and that, and brought up in this way and that way, and not indulging in unpleasant occupations or occupations which have some danger, and which I admit have some definite disabilities which may have to be dealt with. It is all very well to say that, but I cannot help putting to myself the question, What right have I to prohibit some child from earning money in this way which it desires to earn, if it is hungry, and if it wants to fill its stomach? There may be evils in street trading, but there are few evils for a growing child worse than that of being hungry; and if it wants additional food and is able to earn it in this way without serious damage, and the parent is willing that it should earn money in this way, I feel I am not justified, because I think there should be a more ideal state of things, in preventing that child from earning this money. Personally I am not prepared, and I never should in any similar case be prepared, to support a remedy which would not absolutely cure the evil you have to meet. I think this Bill goes a great deal too far, and though I sympathise with the desire that this thing should not be, we are not justified in bringing about the result in this way unless we are going to put something in its place and make up to these
<col>788</col>
children the money we are taking away or depriving them of earning. If a child which would otherwise have to go hungry can earn its sustenance by street trading without suffering serious injury, I do not consider myself justified in preventing its doing so because I would like to see a more ideal state of things existing. For that reason I am bound to support this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01564"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF LONDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with great interest to the speech of the noble Earl who has just spoken, but I expect that a speech like that was made against every one of the reforms made by the noble Earl's (Lord Shaftesbury's) predecessor. There are cases when it is necessary to step in and protect the children. I have listened to those arguments before, and they have been discounted, and we all know now that the factory legislation was right in the protection of children. I fully acknowledge that the noble Lord who introduced the Amendment has at heart the interests of the boys and girls as much as I have, but I would like to say one or two things. The first is that this is a serious question concerning 37,000 children at least, and it is a growing evil. Therefore we cannot lightly pass it by. The noble Lord is wrong in thinking that children in London stay at school up to the age of fourteen; they do not stay as a rule till anything like the age of fourteen. The noble Lord said there was no harm to the school children in carrying on this trading after their school work was over. That is against the opinion of all the experts who have to deal with the school life of London. If you read the interesting evidence, which I have read in great detail to-day, given on the character and wellbeing of the children of school age, your Lordships will see that a nervous breakdown is involved if these poor little children are sent to earn their living early in the morning before school; and I consider that great harm is being done by their being allowed to work after school time.<lb/>
But there is a more serious question about the boys. At six o'clock yesterday I was addressing a very different audience. I was addressing 200 boys in Borstal Prison. And in this connection I would remind your Lordships that the evidence, given in the Departmental Committee's Report, of all those who have to deal with the criminal classes is that the criminal class is fed by juvenile street trading. The boy gets into
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0420"/>
<col>789</col>
habits which lead him very often into prison, We must consider that. Then there is that terrible <i>queue</i> on the Embankment of unemployed and unemployable. The evidence on this question was considered by a most experienced Committee appointed by the present Government, and they said that this unemployable class, again, is fed from these boys who are allowed to drift about the street and go without a trade. We all know that the question is really to a large extent one of the newspaper trade. Of these thousands of children, I should think that quite nine out of ten are employed in the newspaper trade. Cannot newspapers be sold in the streets in a better way than this? Some of us know the conditions in foreign towns, where there are numerous little stalls where newspapers can be purchased. Something of that sort might be done here, but not at the cost of all this harm to the life of our young people. Some important newspapers, the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> for instance, make a point of employing older people as street sellers because of the mischief done by the employment of boys. Surely that is a matter that might be considered. When, however, you come to the question of street trading by girls, the Report seems to say in the strongest language that such street trading is absolutely indefensible. When you have got to that stage, is it enough to merely support an Amendment in this form? It seems to me that this is a national question of the most serious kind, and must be dealt with by the nation as a whole. I know the poorer homes probably better than any of your. Lordships. I have spent years of my life in visiting them. I know the difficulties and do not deny the hardships that will be occasioned in some cases, but I put what is for the good of the country against sentiments such as were expressed by the noble Earl who last spoke.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01565"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think any of your Lordships are in conflict with the right rev. Prelate as to the necessity of doing something to remedy the evil which has been testified to by many noble Lords and by the right rev. Prelate himself, who we all acknowledge is a conspicuous authority on a matter of this kind. But we have not only their testimony. We have the authority of the Report of the Departmental Committee to which reference has been made. I have tried to read this Report
<col>790</col>
with some care, and though it undoubtedly goes to show that there is a great evil, yet I do not think it bears out all the statements which have been made on behalf of this Bill. Let me take one example to show what I mean. The right rev. Prelate and others have said that street trading leads children into bad courses, and that after they have been engaged in street trading for a certain period they are liable to avoid anything like proper industry and to drift into the category of the loafer and finally into the category of the unemployable. But the figures in the Majority Report do not entirely bear out that view. No doubt they bear it out in a measure, and that is why we are all in favour of something being done; but they do not bear out the view in anything like the extreme form in which it has been stated.<lb/>
It seems that, though there is a very large number of young boy traders, when they get to the age of fourteen the number enormously diminishes. I have the figures for London. There are 10,000 boy traders between the ages of eleven and fourteen, and there are 3,000 between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, so it is perfectly clear that rather more than two-thirds leave street trading and adopt some other occupation when they grow older, which is directly in conflict with the contention that all these children, or the majority of them, go to the bad. And what is true of London is true of the whole country. I quote again from the Majority Report. I hope your Lordships will forgive me for quoting from the Report, but this is the authority on which the Bill is proposed to you. In England and Wales, outside London, there are 15,000 boys licensed below the age of fourteen, and only 6,000 between fourteen and sixteen, so that the large proportion of those boys do not go on in the disastrous street trading of which so much complaint has justly been made. I say that by way of showing that we must not exaggerate when we are dealing with these cases.<lb/>
I now come to the question of rural and urban districts. What does the Report say as between the case of large towns and the case of small towns in country districts? The Minority Report says&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no evidence before us showing the, extent to which street trading is carried on in the smaller towns and rural districts, the forms which it takes, or its results."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0421"/>
<col>791</col>
I am quoting now from the Minority Report, but I know nothing in the Majority Report which is in conflict with that statement of the minority. If you look a little lower down in the Minority Report you find this statement&#x2014;
<quote>"Nor do we think a case has been made out for extending the prohibition to the whole of the country. As already pointed out, the conditions outside the large towns have not been investigated by the Committee."</quote>
So your Lordships will observe that there is no evidence before you in this Report to lead you to draw any conclusions whatever on that part of the subject. In view of the wide definition which is given to street trading, absolute prohibition would interfere with branches of work which are probably quite harmless. I think I have said enough on that score to show why it is necessary to frame the remedy much more mildly than in his enthusiasm my noble friend has framed it.<lb/>
Let me point out also that there was a very important witness&#x2014;Sir Edward Troup&#x2014;who said he thought that compulsion would be exceedingly difficult to enforce, and the Minority Report definitely states that in their opinion compulsion would be a mistake. But my noble friend Lord Shaftesbury asks, Are we to do nothing? I agree that something must be done. I do not say that the Amendment is necessarily and absolutely the best compromise at which we, can arrive, but remember it is proposed to do something and something very substantial.

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01567"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I will explain to the right rev. Prelate if he will allow me. He will find in the principal Act, in Section 2, a provision under which certain powers to make certain by-laws are given to local authorities. It appears that a great number of local authorities have not used this power. The noble Lord who brings forward this Amendment proposes that they should all be made to use these powers. I turn again to the Report to show that it is a good power&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01568"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt? I want to explain to the noble Marquess with regard to the section
<col>792</col>
he has just referred to&#x2014;Section 2 of the principal Act, which empowers the local authorities to make by-laws. It is proposed to repeal that section. You will see to the Schedule of the Bill an Amendment which proposes to repeal that section. The noble Lord who moved this Amendment does not seem to quarrel with the repealing of that section, because there is no Amendment down in his name to amend that provision in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01569"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It is quite possible that the repeal of the section goes too far. That remains for my noble friend who has drawn the Bill; but, as a matter of fact, in Lord Faber's Amendment the by-law provision is re-enacted, with a few additions, in almost exactly the same terms as it stands in Section 2 of the principal Act, but for clearness sake I referred to it as Section 2 of the Act. The point I want to make is this, that this power of making by-laws is effective. It has been used in three great cities, in Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham, and in all three places I understand it has been effective. I take the Report again, because, after all, this is a matter of evidence; it is not a matter of theory. The Report says&#x2014;

Now that is very important. Here is the testimony of these members of the Com-

mittee, including the Home Office representative&#x2014;the representative of His Majesty's Government upon the Committee&#x2014;and they say that the system of regulation has not been a failure but a success. It may be necessary and proper to strengthen the power of regulation, and, for example, to see that the regulations are approved by some central authority like the Home Office itself, but there is no doubt that the system of regulation, which my noble friend proposes to make universal and no longer optional on the local authority, has been shown to be a success. That strong testimony to the value of the scheme put forward by my noble friend is not, if I may say so, quite consistent with Lord Shaftesbury's argument that this Amendment would do nothing to meet the difficulty and the evil of street trading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01574"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: I did not wish to give that impression. 1 think it will go a long way, but I do not think it goes quite far enough.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01575"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I did not desire for a moment to convict my noble friend of any kind of inconsistency, but I wanted to show your Lordships that this was not an illusory remedy, but a real remedy. For those reasons it seems to me that the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Faber is a good and sound Amendment, and that the original proposal of the Bill goes too far. To enact that no boy under the age of seventeen is to engage in street trading is a very drastic thing indeed to do. It is impossible. I have received a communication from a very great authority in respect to the poor of London, and he tells me that it would inflict great suffering if we passed the Bill in the form in which it is drawn. In those circumstances Lord Faber has done his best to put forward an alternative proposal far less drastic than the one submitted by the noble Earl. If it requires a little modification, that can be done now or at a future stage; but I cannot help thinking that your Lordships will be well advised to accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01576"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships will agree with me that we are discussing this Amendment on the basis of a conversation which took place on the other side of the House, and which I have no doubt was exceedingly
<col>794</col>
interesting, between the noble Earl who introduced the Bill and the noble Lord below the Gangway, but on this side it was exceedingly difficult to hear what was really said, as they seemed to address their remarks to one another rather than to the House. The noble Marquess opposite has made a speech much of which would have been excellently in place on the Second Reading, and which was very largely against the principle of the Bill rather than in favour of its amendment</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01577"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Earl kindly point out a single phrase which I used which was not perfectly material to the Amendment I was discussing?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01578"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I refer to the way in which the noble Marquess proceeded to point out that this was unnecessary and that was unnecessary in the present Bill and that it would be quite sufficient if something a great deal less was done. If lie had said that on the Second Reading I think he would probably have found himself more in accord with those who did on that occasion express opposition to the measure itself. Your Lordships' House is very fortunate in possessing a number of experts who take a great deal of interest in this subject, and who know a great deal about it. The Amendment is not very easy to follow, but, as I understand it, what happens exactly under the Amendment is this, that while this particular paragraph is left out, Section 2 of the principal Act is also omitted, but, as the noble Marquess pointed out, it is re-enacted in the same permissive form in the clause which ho will move at a later stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01579"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It is Lord Faber who will move it.</membercontribution></p>

<col>795</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01583"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am coming to the point if noble Lords will allow me. I say that the second part of the noble Lord's Amendment says "<i>may</i>"; the first part re-enacts Section 2 of the principal Act, and the first part, which is the new part, is compulsory. That, I think, there is no doubt about. I apologise to noble Lords for taking the second part of the clause first. It seemed to me to be more convenient, but I was mistaken.<lb/>
The first part of the matter is that this business of making by-laws is compulsory. I hope now we have really got to the point.. But I think we ought to know from the noble Lord who proposes the Amendment whether he has had any communication with municipal boroughs or councils of urban districts as to whether they are prepared to undertake this duty, and whether they approve of being given these compulsory powers. The House is so well able to judge of the merits of this proposal without any intervention on the part of His Majesty's Government, that we shall take no official part in the Division which may take place. For my own part, I feel somewhat strongly that what has been said in opposition to the proposals in the Bill is very similar to what has been said against most reforms which have been introduced on subjects of this kind in the past, and I shall be inclined to vote for the original Bill in the shape in which it was introduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01584"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I took no part in the Second Reading of this Bill because I had not fully considered the matter, but since then I have received many communications which have compelled me to take the subject into consideration. I listened, of course with respect, to everything that was said by the right rev. Prelate, the Bishop of London, and by the noble Earl who is in charge of the Bill, but I am bound to use my own judgment and see what the Bill proposes. At present the law prohibits children under eleven years of age from engaging in street trading, and it is a tremendous jump to raise the age to seventeen. It is far beyond the necessities of the case. I venture to say that wherever this proposal has become known it has shocked public opinion. It has astounded the people. When we look round and see the appeals for charity which are made every day, and when we are told of the great want that exists in many of the poor homes in London
<col>796</col>
and consider the possibility of children I being robbed of the chance of earning money we must realise that the Bill would imperil many poor homes. The right rev. Prelate speaks necessarily with the greatest knowledge of the diocese over which he presides; he did not purport to speak of places outside; but this is a Bill that proposes to deal, not with London only, but with every city and town and village in the kingdom, and to announce everywhere that no boy under seventeen is to be permitted to engage in street trading. That strikes me as something that shocks all common sense. I do not say that the Bill, amended as it will be, I hope, by the addition of the Amendments proposed, will then be perfect. I would, however, be very sorry if the Bill were lost, and I would be quite prepared to consider with attention any Amendments moved with the object of making it more in harmony with what I regard as common sense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01585"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in discussing this kind of question, there is great danger of exaggeration on either side. We are liable, in the desire to be brief, to become categorical, and if we are categorical, then we are apt to exaggerate. In this particular matter there is danger in that direction, both on the part of those who are supporting the Bill and on the part of those who are in favour of Lord Faber's Amendment embodying what seems to me to be altogether a different proposal. I confess I have been amazed by one or two of the speeches we have heard to-night, and above all by the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Russell. That speech, as I think has been already said, reminds one of the opposition which was offered to the early Factory Bills or the Chimney Boys' Bill, and to everything of that kind, when we were told that it was very important, no doubt, that things should be regulated, but that it was much more important that people should be able to live, and that if you did this, that, or the other you prevented them from living by taking away practically their means of living.</membercontribution></p>

<col>797</col>
Bill as it stands as regards the restrictions he suggests upon the employment of boys. It does seem to me that he would be acting wisely in the interests of the Bill and in the interests of the boys themselves if he were to modify somewhat the proposals which the Bill now contains; but it is going a great deal beyond that to say, that what we ought to do to-night is to accept Lord Faber's Amendment. If I understand the Amendment rightly, it would impose the duty of making by-laws on local authorities, but what these by-laws are to be, except that they may not go too far, is left entirely to the local authority. Unless I misunderstand the purport of the Amendment, a local authority which was backward in this matter and did not take a proper interest in it at all might pass by-laws which would be fatal to any such amelioration as this Bill is desiring to produce. If I am misinterpreting or exaggerating the purport of the Amendment I desire to be corrected, but that is how it presents itself to me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01588"><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: If your:Lordships will allow me to say so, that is what I think. The original Act does this. It is a very difficult. Act to understand, but I have got back practically to the 1903 Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01589"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: The proposed new clause says that these authorities must make by-laws, but it does not matter what by-laws they make, except that they may not go too far. The by-laws may be as open as ever you like; and when the noble Marquess rested his <i>quasi</i> adoption of that principle upon the Minority Report, which, of course, differs broadly and widely from the Report of the majority, I think he had overlooked the fact that the Minority Report most distinctly said that street trading in cities and large towns should be prohibited for girls up to eighteen, subject to such and such reservations. If we adopt this new clause it would be perfectly open to a local authority to do nothing, and thus directly to contravene the recommendation in the Minority Report. There are other details upon which it would be easy to dwell, but it is a little difficult in the form that our argument has taken to know exactly with what particular proposal the House is dealing at the moment. I venture to believe that we should act far more wisely, if, as I hope is the case, we are not going to wreck this Bill, if we were to pass these clauses now as they stand and then amend
<col>798</col>
them on Report. The Bill as it stands affords a better basis for considering future Amendments than it would afford were the suggested clause of the noble Lord introduced into it. If we introduce this Amendment, we change the whole trend, purport, and character of the Bill, and I hope it will not be accepted. There are Amendments which, in my opinion, it would be wise to make, but they could be better adapted on the Report Stage to the text of the Bill as submitted by Lord Shaftesbury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01590"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess I very much sympathise with those who see the dangers of legislation which would prevent the children of poor people earning money necessary for their welfare and that of their families. I think Lord Shaftesbury has gone somewhat too far in the provisions of this Bill. On the other hand, it seems that the most rev. Primate has put the case against Lord Faber's Amendment with very great force. It would never do to leave to local authorities absolute discretion as to what by-laws they should make, for they might be utterly repugnant to anybody who desires to see the proper regulation of juvenile street trading. I think your Lordships have some cause of complaint lit regard to the speech of the noble Earl the First Commissioner of Works. Surely this is a matter on which, as officially representing the Home Office, he ought to have been able to give some guidance to your Lordships. It was a matter which was inquired into under the auspices of the Home Office by a Committee on which representatives of the Home Office sat, and I confess that my own vote would be very much influenced if I knew precisely what the Home Office believe to be the best way of dealing with this question. I would suggest to Lord Shaftesbury that if he could tell us that he would be prepared to consider other Amendments to the Bill&#x2014;such as, for instance, fixing the age for prohibiting boys from street trading at less than seventeen&#x2014;it might facilitate the passage of the Bill through this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01591"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the speeches of the most rev. Primate and the noble Viscount opposite I will trouble your Lordships with very few remarks, because I am in substantial agreement with both of those speeches. But I wish to refer to one or two observations in the speech made by the noble Marquess. I do not think that the noble Marquess proved the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0425"/>
<col>799</col>
efficacy of permissive by-laws by quoting the example of three extremely active and energetic towns such as Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham. We all know that permissive by-laws will operate in some places, and operate very well, but the objection is that they operate just in proportion to the public spirit and energy of the town. What we want is to have some legislation which will secure that the proper elements of civilisation shall be secured to these children no matter where they live. I wish further to point out an objection to the proposal to exclude all the country except urban and other districts with a certain population. I agree that small towns, as for instance Devizes or Abingdon, are not places in which the conditions of life stimulate urban trading, but when you look to the great northern areas in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and places like that, the mere fact that a district has under 20,000 persons does not at all exclude it from the characteristics of a large urban district. I hope this Amendment will be withdrawn, and that we shall be able to come to some reasonable amendment of the Bill itself, but on better lines. I entirely agree as to the evils which have to be guarded against, but I think seventeen is far too high an age to fix. I cannot help thinking that we should adequately protect the child if the limit in regard to boys was put up to, say, fifteen. I agree that the case of girls rests upon very different considerations. We know that with girls from fifteen to seventeen is the most dangerous age, and it is an age in which, from the social and moral point of view, we should do our utmost to keep them off the streets, especially after dark. But that rests upon another set of considerations, and I think these ought to be carefully considered, either later in Committee or on Report.<lb/>
I cannot help thinking, as there is plenty of time, and as the debate is gradually drawing the whole House to a common conclusion, that if the debate were adjourned it would give time to Lord Shaftesbury to consider what Amendments he could accept, and then perhaps the Bill might become an agreed Bill. It has been clearly indicated in the Minority Report that you ought not to leave to local authorities the making of such by-laws without some supervision. They should be approved by some Government Department, not merely to weaken them, but, if necessary, to strengthen them. I hope we are going to treat this as a matter
<col>800</col>
of Statutory regulation, subject to reasonable modifications and indulgence; and if we are going to leave it in the region of by-laws I hope we shall not limit the power to these urban districts. I think it might very well also be given to the county councils to apply to any particular district in their area. The county councils in such places as Lancashire or the West Riding of Yorkshire would use their judgment and consider whether there were areas within their district where this danger existed and which ought to have these regulations. There ought to be the power of putting the law in force in every part of the country where the occasion arises. I think if we could come to some agreement like that, and make a material reduction in the age as to boys&#x2014;I leave the question of girls open, because I feel that that depends upon other arguments&#x2014;and, if possible, keep the Bill in its present framework&#x2014;namely, Statutory recognition of the fact that this street trading shall be restricted within certain limits&#x2014;we shall have a satisfactory Bill, and one to which we could all agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01592"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree so much with the last speaker and so greatly desire an agreement by consent that I should hardly have risen were it not that there is one point which I particularly commend to the attention of the House, and not least to the attention of the noble Lord who has just sat down. You take the age of seventeen and say, as Lord Ashbourne said, "What a tremendous jump from eleven to seventeen." So it appears; but you really want to guard against a boy coming out of school drifting into these most objectionable and finally destructive employments, against which the whole of the evidence is so damning. Therefore, my point would be that we must be careful to give the lad time to get, perhaps by the help of societies who wish to assist him, some more useful and steady employment.</membercontribution></p>

a little too far; yet everybody is agreed, which, after all, is something to have gained, that something should be done. I always considered that the Amendments that were put down by Lord Faber were a step in advance upon the present existing law, although in some details they were defective. I also notice that some noble Lords seem to be of the opinion that the local authority should be left a say in the matter. If that is really the wish of this House, I am prepared, as the author of the Bill, to accept it. But I am going to appeal to Lord Faber to withdraw his Amendment which appears on the last sheet of Amendments. It is to the Schedule and proposes to omit from the column headed, "Extent of Repeal," the words: "In subsection two of section three, the words 'under the age of eleven.'" Let me explain what the effect of that will be. It will be that the original Act of 1903, Section 3, subsection (2), will read, "A child shall not be occupied in street trading." That means that you will get statutory prohibition up to the age of fourteen, for a boy, under the law, is a child until he is fourteen years of age.</membercontribution></p>

With regard to the first part, I will not propose it if he does not wish it. There are two exceptions in the definition clause as to street trading, and I seek to except, in the first instance, street trading which is merely incidental to the delivery of goods by boys who are in the regular employment of shopkeepers and tradesmen. I am not quite sure how far those words are necessary, but I offer them to your Lordships' House. With regard to the second part, it is to protect a very particular class. There is a practice of children living in rural districts being sent by their parents to sell local produce at the markets. That would be street trading within the meaning of the Act. It is a matter of convenience to the parents, and no one can say that it does any harm. I imagine we should not think of suggesting restrictive legislation to prevent these children being so employed.

The noble Lord said: I understand that the noble Earl seeks to repeal this provision in the Act of 1903 in order to put the control of street trading in the hands of the education authority. But the education authority of the City of London is the London County Council, and the effect of this repeal would be to remove the control of street trading from the hands of the Corporation and place it in the hands of the London County Council. There would be this further effect, that the Corporation would be placed in an inferior position to any borough in the country with a population of over 10,000, and to any rural district with a population of over 20,000. I understand that during this session of Parliament a Select Committee of this House has passed a Bill promoted by the Corporation of the City which, amongst other provisions, contains one which extends their control over street trading, and that Bill I understand has the approval of the Home Secretary. Apart from the inconvenience and anomaly of having two overlapping authorities, I think it will be admitted that it is impossible for this House in one session to give with one hand and to take away with the other. They Corporation feels rather aggrieved, and I hope the noble Earl will be able to remove that feeling.</p>

I was, however, quite prepared, if I had been directly appealed to, to express that approval. With regard to the general point on which the noble Marquess appeals to me, this is one of the matters upon which there are many experts already in this House, and the Home Office is not in the least unready to be guided, by experts who have very great knowledge of these questions. We might be open to some criticism, if we always came down with prepared opinions, and took no notice of expressions which come from various quarters of the House. I think the noble Marquess would then have cause to complain of me, perhaps even more bitterly than he does to-night.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE BOARDING-OUT OF PAUPER<lb/> CHILDREN.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01658"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government how many children at present in Irish workhouses can be boarded out under existing regulations, and how many are so boarded out. The noble Earl said: I would ask your Lordships' permission to make one or two remarks in the hope that the Government may see their way to encourage a little more than they do the system of boarding out children from Irish workhouses. I do not suggest that it is discouraged, but I would like to see the system more encouraged than it is at present. By the Acts of 1898 and 1902 orphans and deserted children can be boarded out, and there are definitions which, as far as I know, quite satisfactorily define who are to be considered orphans and who are to be considered deserted children. If parents desire and are able to bring up their own children, they are amply safeguarded. I need not go into these definitions or into the regulations issued years ago by the Irish Department, which are wise and on the right lines, but I believe the facilities which exist are not as much used as they ought to be. There are 158 or 159 Poor-law unions in Ireland, and as far as I know these regulations are used in a few more than 120. There are, therefore, certainly thirty unions in which they are not used at all, and I am informed that in many cases where they are in force they are not used to anything like the extent they might be. I know that this matter will probably come up for consideration when your Lordships are considering the subject of Poor-law Reform, but there seems to be very little prospect of any progress being made in that direction at any rate for a year or two; and I think it will be agreed on all hands that every child saved from the workhouse in the meantime is a gain to society. For this reason I have ventured to put down this Question. I would urge upon the Government that wherever the boarding-out system has been used it has had a very good effect, and I hope they will see their way to instruct the Local Government Board to encourage Guardians to make greater use than they have done of the boarding-out system, without prejudice, of course, to any action they may subsequently take in the reform of the Poor-law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01659"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the noble Earl I have to say that,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0430"/>
<col>809</col>
according to the Returns of the Local Government Board, there were on the 18th instant 2,552 children boarded out in 126 unions. The Board have no information as to whether there were in those or the remaining thirty-two unions other children who might be so boarded out. In England the class of children that may be boarded out are regulated by Order of the Local Government Board, but in Ireland they are governed by the Pauper Children Act of 1898; and the Pauper Children (Ireland) Act of 1902 further defines the expression "orphan or deserted child." I may remind the noble Earl that in reply to a Question on February 31 last the Chief Secretary stated that the matter would he taken into consideration when the whole question of Poor-law Reform for Ireland was being taken. I do not think that the saving of children from the workhouses will be lost sight of, and the noble Earl may rest assured that the Chief Secretary will give the matter his consideration when opportunity arises.</membercontribution></p>

<title>YEOMANRY SERGEANT-MAJORS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01660"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD VIVIAN</member> rose to call attention to War Office Letter No. 9, General No. 2243 (A.G. 2A), dated August 31, 1910, in which it was stated that the question of the organisation of the Permanent Staff of the Territorial Force was under consideration, and pending the issue of further instructions, all vacancies for sergeant-instructors occurring in all arms of the Territorial Force would be filled by non-commissioned officers on the Home Establishment holding the rank of sergeant, such appointments to be made for two years with a possible extension to a maximum of five years; and to ask the Secretary of State for War whether any representations have been made by officers commanding Yeomanry regiments as to the increased difficulties in recruiting these appointments would entail, and the advisability of reverting to the former practice of appointing sergeant-majors from Cavalry regiments for an indefinite period should this now be the regulation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01661">The noble Lord said: My Lords, as I happen to be the first member of your Lordships' House to address a Question to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, who has to-day taken his seat in this House, I hope it will not be considered out of place if I offer him my congratulations
<col>810</col>
upon his elevation. The noble Viscount has rendered great services to the country, not the least of which has been the great part he has played in the creation of the Territorial Force. These new appointments will, I feel sure, affect the strength of the Territorial Force very considerably, and will affect it at a time when those who have its interests at heart find it difficult not only to increase but to maintain its strength. I shall confine myself in my remarks to the manner in which I believe they will affect the Yeomanry, because I happen to hold a commission in the Yeomanry, and having served in the Regulars I feel that I can speak with a certain amount of practical experience behind me.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01662">The three evils to be feared are a scarcity of recruits, the disinclination on the part of time-expired men to re-engage, and the increased amount of work and worry accruing to commanding and squadron officers. As regards the scarcity of recruits, the practice in the past, as probably most of your Lordships know, has been for a sergeant-major to be appointed. He has come down to the recruiting area and by degrees has got to know most of the families, and he has either then and there been able to get recruits or has been able to mark down the men who, at some future day, will make useful recruits for the Yeomanry. The whole idea of recruiting has been to do it in this way, and to carry on a continuous and methodical nursing of the recruiting area. Under these new appointments these new sergeants will come down for two years, with a possible extension for another three years. At the end of their second year, they may possibly know the recruiting area, and they may be useful to us provided they get the extension. But we are going to have all the trouble over again upon the next appointments, for the new man coming in at the end of five years will have to begin all over again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01663">As regards the disinclination of time-expired men to re-engage, I feel that this will grow, because, after all, the methods used in the Regulars are entirely different from the methods used in the Yeomanry. An immense amount of tact is required to bring out the best qualities of the Yeomanry. I very much doubt whether these new sergeants will show the requisite tact. We have very often found it was not the case with the old sergeant-majors, but I am afraid that these new sergeants
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0431"/>
<col>811</col>
will not show it, although possibly some may. As regards the additional work and worry accruing to commanding and squadron officers, I have had personal experience of that in my own regiment. But what I wish to point out is that although we have had bad cases under the old <i>r&#x00E9;gime,</i> owing to the frequent changes they are likely to occur much more frequently. I really do not know why this change was advocated, and I should like to ask the Secretary of State for War whether any complaints were received from commanding officers. I may possibly get the answer "No." But still I would very much like the Secretary of State for War to state whether the War Office ever consulted commanding officers before this change was made. Surely in a change like this it is only right to consult commanding officers, whose opinions are worth having on recruiting, which is a most essential point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01664">I do not know whether this scheme has been brought in on the ground of reduction of expense. I do not see where the reduction of expense comes in, but possibly the Secretary of State may be able to tell me. Reduction of expense may come in here, that very likely you will have fewer members of the Territorial Force to pay because you will drive your men out and will not get recruits. In conclusion, let me say that to maintain a strong and efficient Territorial Force entails hard work combined with tact, and also, as I said before, a continuous method of nursing the recruiting area is absolutely essential; and to carry this scheme out successfully it should be the duty of every commanding officer to see that he is surrounded by the very best men that he can find to form his Permanent Staff, and if they are not fully competent to carry out their duties the matter can always be inquired into by the General officers. It is because I believe that these new appointments will not answer these requirements that I have ventured to draw your Lordships' attention to this matter, and to put the question to the Secretary of State for War.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01665"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has referred to myself in terms of kindly courtesy, for which I thank him. Nevertheless, I am reluctant to intrude myself at this early stage on your Lordships' notice even for a moment. I cannot
<col>812</col>
help myself, however, because my noble friend who sits by my side (Lord Lucas) no longer occupies the position of Under-Secretary of State for War, and the duty of responding, therefore, falls upon me.<lb/>
The noble Lord has referred to the changes which have been made on the recommendation of the Committee which has recently sat. The changes arise out of the altered conditions of the Yeomanry regiments. To begin with, a good deal of the administration which used to be done by the regimental authorities is now done by the Associations. The system has changed. In the second place, we found venerable institutions in the shape of sergeant-majors who had been there for a very long time. Some of them were admirable; all of them were beloved by the regiments to which they were attached; but some of them, at all events, were of an age and a physical configuration that did not lend itself to efficient Yeomanry training. Therefore, a Committee was appointed on which the noble Earl opposite, Lord Scarbrough, and others connected with the Territorial Force and in particular with the Yeomanry sat, and a careful investigation was made of the whole question. We were not dealing with the Yeomanry only, but, of course, with the entire Territorial Forces, and the Yeomanry necessarily came into it. After much consideration, the Committee recommended that for the greater efficiency of the Force it was desirable that in the future there should be younger and more active men, more abreast with the latest developments of training Infantry, and otherwise more fitted to take a really active part in the work of a squadron.<lb/>
I of course recognise the value of some of those old sergeant-majors in getting recruits and generally in promoting good feeling, but in the Yeomanry you are not at the point where you have the greatest difficulty in getting recruits. The Committee were not apprehensive on that point, but they were clear about this, that a system of appointments under which a man should go on practically for the rest of his natural life as sergeant-major in a Yeomanry regiment was not a good one. They therefore recommended that there should be a minimum term of two years, capable of being extended to five years. There should be the same kind of change of tour and duty as there is in the Regulars.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0432"/>
<col>813</col>
A non-commissioned officer under the old system was being paid less than the Regular non-commissioned officer. The Committee laid it down that in the interests of efficiency it is desirable that a non-commissioned officer who goes to the Territorial Force, whether Yeomanry or not, should be paid exactly the same rate as a Regular sergeant is paid. The result will be, we hope, to get a more efficient class of non-commissioned officer.<lb/>
The noble Lord has asked whether we consulted Yeomanry commanding officers. We did. Of course, there is a difference of opinion in this matter. Some of the Brigade commanding officers came to the War Office and talked the matter over with my noble friend. Except for that visit I think we have only had complaint in the case of one commanding officer. This is a matter on which, naturally, there is a great deal of diversity of opinion. People's instincts in a matter of this kind are rather conservative. They are apt to think because somebody has been very useful that nobody can be found to do his work. We took the view, following the recommendation of the Committee, that there was an evil to be redressed, that the way the Committee proposed to deal with it was the proper way, and that at least the new system should have a careful trial. It was impossible to remain under the old state of things. We have got a new system, and we will see how it works. We hope it is right; but at all events what we are doing is in conformity with the best advice and the most skilled opinions we can obtain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01666"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say how much we on these Benches congratulate the House upon the accession of the noble Viscount to our discussions. I only rise to put this one point to the noble Viscount on this particular question. He said that the two years system had been adopted, with a possible extension to five years. Now, the only point which from my experience I think very valuable would be that we should have some feeling of security that if the commanding officer desired the extension and there was no real reason against it, the two years would be extended to five years. I think the constant passage to and fro of men of the particular rank involved would be undesirable from the point of view of the efficiency of a regiment. Of course, a
<col>814</col>
break after two years is an advantage, because it would give an opportunity of removing the man if he was not doing good work. But may we take it that the commanding officer will be consulted, and that if he reports well it will be the exception and not the rule that the man will be removed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01667"><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret extremely that on this the first occasion on which the noble Viscount has risen in this House to respond on behalf of his Department it should he my fate to in any sense criticise his reply, and the more so as I am generally in accord with my noble friend. But I think he is aware that I hold strong views with regard to this particular matter, and I feel bound to support the noble Lord opposite, and to urge that as soon as possible, for I believe it will come, there should be a reconsideration of what I believe is a most important matter with regard to the efficiency of the Yeomanry. I cannot help feeling at the back of my mind&#x2014;I hope it is not so&#x2014;that the real reason for this change may be a certain reduction with regard to the Estimates. [VISCOUNT HALDANE dissented.] That is not so. I am very glad to know that. But as far as I am personally concerned I am bound to say that I prefer, on broad grounds, the ancient institutions of which my noble friend has spoken, the old sergeant-majors, to the two years gentlemen we are going to have in the future. Those sergeant-majors&#x2014;and this is my personal experience after a good many years of Volunteer service&#x2014;were most admirable men, and, permanently appointed to finish their term of service with the particular Volunteer regiment, they looked upon that regiment as their own, and the men in that regiment looked upon the sergeant-major as a sort of heavy father. It seems to me years a particular sergeant would hardly have become acquainted with his regiment at all, and at the end of five years, if there was an extension, he would be only just becoming acquainted with the men. After all, a Territorial regiment is very different from a Regular regiment. A Territorial regiment is only together for fifteen days in the year, and for the remainder of the year the men are dotted about in various parts of the locality. It is therefore extremely difficult for any sergeant-instructor to get to know his men in a short
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0433"/>
<col>815</col>
time. There is one other matter which I would like to put to your Lordships, and to the noble Viscount particularly&#x2014;that is, the matter of pay. Under the old system a sergeant-major instructor, as I understand it, received pay to the amount of 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>, with quarters found. The new man, I understand, will now get 5s. 6&#x00BD;<i>d</i>, with no quarters found.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01668"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: What is his lodging allowance?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01669"><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: He receives lodging allowance, but the old sergeant-major got quarters found and 6<i>s</i> 6<i>d.</i> All I wish to say is that this may be a real hardship to a sergeant who has to come very often to headquarters, which may be in a large town where rents are very often 10<i>s</i>. a week. His position is not nearly so good as the position of the old sergeant-major used to be. I do not know whether I can ask my noble friend to consider the situation with a view to something being done to assist the man in that particular regard. There is only one other point on which I feel rather strongly. I do not believe that under this two years' system you will get the Colonels of Regular regiments to send their best sergeants to Yeomanry regiments. I feel strongly, at any rate so far as General officers and Brigade majors and general sergeant-instructors are concerned, that as we have not the same opportunities for drill and instruction as the Regular forces have, we should have the very best we can possibly get, and unless you get that state of things I do not think you will ever secure thorough efficiency in the Territorial service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01670"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: May I add one word to what has fallen from my noble friend Lord Willingdon? I could give a case of a sergeant of Yeomanry whose rent exceeds his lodging allowance, with extras, by something like 4<i>s.</i> per week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01671"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SCARBROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War mentioned my name in connection with the Committee which sat on this question, and to a certain extent I feel my responsibility in the matter. I sympathise with the noble Lord who has raised this question. I do not think it was wise to interfere with the existing system as regards the Yeomanry. Undoubtedly the Infantry had a grievance. They claimed
<col>816</col>
that as regards scattered battalions they had not a sufficient number of Permanent Staff. Their grievance was insufficient numbers and inadequate pay. It is true that the grievance as regards inadequate pay applies to all branches alike, but that as to insufficient numbers only applied to the Infantry as far as I understand. The position with regard to the Yeomanry was very little discussed on the Committee The discussion centred round the Infantry and their two grievances, and in getting rid of these it appears another grievance has been created; but I assume the new system will have to be tried. The proportion, as I understand it, is to be two sergeant-majors and three sergeants to every Yemanry regiment. I urge that the new system, as far as the Yeomanry is concerned, should be carefully watched from the point of view of any interference with recruiting.<lb/>
I have two small practical points to bring to the noble Viscount's notice. One is that you will now have connected with each Yeomanry regiment men of different ranks&#x2014;two sergeant-majors and three sergeants. They are paid on a different scale, and yet they have to keep up practically the same social position for recruiting purposes. How are you going to adjust that? It seems to me they are both doing exactly the same duty. They may even be in the same towns. Therefore they ought to be paid alike, because the cost of living will be exactly the same whether they are sergeants or sergeant-majors. The second point is this. You allow an extension after two years to sergeants on the application of the commanding officer of the Yeomanry, who is sure to do his utmost to retain a good man. Is the sergeant himself prepared to accept that? Presumably he is an excellent man, an efficient man, or else the extension would not be asked for. Is it fair that he should lose the chance of promotion in his own regiment by being kept for five years in a Territorial corps? I would suggest that if a sergeant is given an extension of three years after his two years' service he should be automatically promoted to the rank of sergeant-major; otherwise, that man, at the end of five years, goes back to his regiment with very small chances indeed of ever getting promotion. Those are two points which I hope Lord Haldane will consider when the new system has got into working order.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"That in view of the altered strategic conditions in Europe, this House views with grave and growing concern the inadequate military arrangements of His Majesty's Government for the defence of this country and of His Majesty's Oversea Dominions."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01707">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I feel the difficulty, I may almost say the embarrassment, of my position this afternoon, in the midst of the excitement caused by the hope of a general disarmament and universal peace&#x2014;at a moment, too, when in England, from every newspaper, from every pulpit, from the heart of this great City of London itself, we are told that this hope will
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0436"/>
<col>821</col>
assuredly shortly be fulfilled&#x2014;I feel I require more than ordinary courage to bring before your Lordships proposals for placing our military system in a more satisfactory condition than it has ever yet attained&#x2014;a condition more secure than any at which we have ever even aimed. But, my Lords, a totally unexpected incident lightens my embarrassment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01708">I refer to the speech delivered by the German Chancellor in the Reichstag last week. That speech&#x2014;that remarkable speech&#x2014;so full of manly sense, appealed to me in a way I find it, difficult to describe. And when the Chancellor proceeded to define what he considered to be the true relation of any nation or of any empire to its armed forces, I found him putting into words a principle which during the past few months, had been repeatedly in my own mind. The German Chancellor, after pointing out the impossibility of applying in any practical way the proposals for the reduction of armaments, laid down as a maxim that, at the present stage of the world's history, the armed forces of any nation or empire must have a distinct relation to the material resources of that nation or empire. This position seems to me, as statesmanlike as it is unanswerable. But, my Lords, in applying the principle to our own country, I should be inclined to modify it by saying that the armed forces of any nation or empire ought to represent not only its material resources, but the spirit which animates that nation or empire. In a word, that its armed forces should be the measure of the nation's devotion to whatever ends it pursues.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01709">Now, how does this country, this great Empire, stand the test of the German Chancellor's maxim, even modified in the way I have suggested? Can we suppose that our existing forces represent either our material resources, or the spirit which animates, or at any rate which ought to animate this country? On the contrary, I affirm that, so far as the Army is concerned, our military system is hopelessly inadequate; we have neither a Home Army such as is needed for the defence of this country, nor an effective Regular Army to protect our Imperial interests abroad. It is because I hold this view so strongly that: I feel impelled to bring to your Lordships' notice the Motion that stands in my name. I am encouraged to hope that this may be the last occasion I need address your Lordships on this
<col>822</col>
subject, from the fact that, such a large proportion of this House expressed their I strong approval of my views when I had the honour eighteen months ago of speaking to I your Lordships on this essentially important question. At the same time no circumstances have arisen since then to make us less anxious about our unpreparedness, or more hopeful as to au effort being made to render the Army better fitted for the various duties it may at any moment be called on to perform.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01710">While, therefore, I feel that I have some grounds for hoping that your Lordships and the country are beginning to realise the urgency of the reform which I and those who of think with me have from time to time pressed upon your consideration, I cannot but be aware that there are still a large number in this House who, apparently, think that it is no business of theirs to inquire into the state of the Army, and, so long as the country makes no move, are content to let matters rest. But is it for you and for the leaders in the other House or for the country to make the move? Is it not to you and to those leaders that the country ought to look for guidance? And so long as you and they remain silent, is it not natural for the people to think that our military arrangements are entirely satisfactory, and that our Army is in all respects what is needed?</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01711">There was, no doubt, some reason for the ready acceptance of Lord Haldane's scheme when the noble Lord first took in hand the remodelling of the Army. It was clear to every one who had studied the subject that we had not got the Army we require; two Royal Commissions had spoken in no uncertain tone as to its unfitness for service both at home and abroad, and it was generally recognised that a radical change was absolutely necessary. Time will not admit of my referring in detail to the several shortcomings which were brought to notice by these Royal Commissions, but there are two of which I must again remind your Lordships, because the greatest stress was laid upon them by both Royal Commissions, and until they have been remedied we cannot hope to have anything like time Army we need. These shortcomings were, first, want of numbers, owing to there being no sound system of expansion; and, secondly, as regards the Home Army, insufficient training. Is it not inconceivable, my Lords, that, notwithstanding the supreme importance of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0437"/>
<col>823</col>
these two vital defects, no effort has been made during the remodelling of the Army to rectify them? On the contrary, they have been carefully ignored.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01712">What did the Royal Commissions say on these two points? The Commission over which Lord Elgin presided recorded the following unanimous opinion&#x2014;
<quote>"'No military system will be satisfactory which does not contain powers of expansion outside the limits of the Regular Forces of the Crown, whatever that limit may be."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01713">This opinion was unanimously endorsed by the Duke of Norfolk's Commission, which, in referring to the Militia, stated that, in its existing condition&#x2014;
<quote>"it is unfit to take the field for the defence of this country."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01714">While with respect to the Volunteers, the Commission reported that&#x2014;
<quote>"neither the musketry nor the tactical training of the rank and file would enable it to face, with prospect of success, the troops of a Continental army."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01715">And again that&#x2014;
<quote>"in view of the unequal military education of the officers, the limited training of the men, and the defects in equipment and organisation, the Volunteer Force is not qualified to take the field against a Regular Army."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01716">The Commissioners wound up their Report by unanimously declaring that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Militia and Volunteer Forces have not at present either the strength or military efficiency required to enable them to fulfil the functions for which they exist&#x2026;and that a Home Defence Army capable in the absence of the whole, or the greater part of the Regular Forces, of protecting this country from invasion, can be raised and maintained only on the principle that it is the duty of every citizen of military age and sound physique to be trained for the national defence, and to take part in it should emergency arise."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01717">No doubt I shall be told by the Secretary of State for War that the opinions expressed by the two Royal Commissions do not now hold good, as the forces to which they refer no longer exist. To this I would reply that the designations alone of these forces are changed. The Volunteers have become Territorials, and the Militia are called the Special Reserve; the Territorials being about the same strength as were the Volunteers. The County Associations and the Officers Training Corps are certainly a gain, and the training of the rank and file may be somewhat better, but it is far short of what is needed, and they get little or no more rifle practice. The Special Reserve being enlisted for foreign service is in that respect
<col>824</col>
an improvement on the Militia, but it is composed mainly of boys who could not possibly be depended upon to withstand the hardships of war, and it is by some thousands weaker in numerical strength than the old Militia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01718">The truth is that the forces which have lately been created are not, and never can be, much better for the purposes of war than were the old forces, which were so unanimously condemned by the Duke of Norfolk's Royal Commission. The same radical defects exist in the new as in the old organisation, and will never be remedied until officers and men are given prolonged and practical training; until they have learnt the discipline which that training alone can impart; until the men have been taught to use their rifles skilfully; and until they can have that absolute faith in their officers, that firm reliance on their comrades, and that implicit confidence in themselves which can only be attained by training, by discipline, and by skill in shooting.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01719">What was it, my Lords, that threw such a lurid light upon the deep defects and utter insufficiency of our military system? Was it not a war that exposed our weakness to so great an extent as to imperil our Imperial interests, and so seriously compromised our credit as a Great Power that we have never wholly recovered it? It was the most costly war, in proportion to its duration and the number of our opponents, ever waged in the world's history. Never did a country pay so clear a price for a faulty military system as we then paid. Surely the humiliating reverses we suffered at that time ought to have brought home to us what a broken reed we lean upon if we trust to untrained troops in time of war; and they should have warned us to put our house in order, and never again to allow ourselves to be subjected to similar disasters&#x2014;disasters which, if inflicted by a more warlike nation and a stronger adversary, would be irreparable, and might indeed cause the loss of the Empire and our downfall as a people. Nearly nine years have passed since peace was made, and I would ask you to put it to yourselves whether we have in that time done anything to show that we have profited by the lessons that the war should have taught us, and whether we have faced the problem squarely, and done what was incumbent upon us to do to render our Army better fitted for success in. future wars.</p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0438"/>
<col>825</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01720">Let us see what has happened. The Regular Army&#x2014;the only portion that can be depended upon to hold its own in the field&#x2014;has been reduced by over 30,000 men, not only a present, but a serious prospective loss. The Militia has been done away with and replaced by the Special Reserve, the doubtful value of which I have already explained. With the money thus saved we have been given a Territorial Force, which is almost as lamentably inefficient in training, even more hopelessly insufficient in number and considerably more costly than were the Auxiliary Forces to which we were obliged to trust in the South African War. Above all we have remained content to allow our military arrangements for home defence to continue to be based upon the same fundamentally defective system which was the cause of all the evil, the length of the war, and the cost of the war&#x2014;namely, voluntary training. I wish our people could be made to realise that an Army is meant primarily not to provoke, but to avert, war, and to preserve for the people the blessings of peace, in return for the cost and effort involved in keeping up an efficient military system. In 1899 the Boers understood, as the whole world outside these shores now understands, that our small Regular Army, without proper powers of expansion and with only its amateur auxiliaries behind it, was infinitely below the needs of the Empire, and totally inadequate for the prompt and thorough waging of war. If those who press for a reduction of our military forces would only remember that, had it not been for this fact, the struggle in South Africa never would, in all probability, have taken place, and its colossal cost would have been avoided, to say nothing of the bloodshed and misery that are the accompaniments of all wars&#x2014;if they would only remember this fact, they could not fail to realise how illogical, how foolish, is their point of view, and how certain is the unpreparedness for war, which they advocate, to bring about the very thing which they so rightly dread.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01721">Unfortunately, the true aspect of the case has never been put before the people by those in authority. The real condition of our military forces, the demands that may be made upon them when war breaks out, and the dangers against which we have to guard, are all, for political purposes, concealed from them. They are made to believe that we now have a far larger and more efficient Army than we had twelve years
<col>826</col>
ago, the truth being that, except that the Artillery is provided with a more powerful gun, and the Cavalry and Infantry with a more useful rifle&#x2014;a rifle, however, very inferior to the rifle with which the German and French troops are armed&#x2014;and except that the Regular portion of the Army is, in some respects, more highly trained, as regards numbers and readiness to take the field or being kept up to war strength while in the field, the Regular Army is neither stronger nor more efficient than it was when the Boer War broke out; while in the course of three or four years it will be much worse off, on account of the automatic decrease in the strength of the Reserve Force owing partly to the discontinuance by the late Mr. Arnold-Forster of Lord Midleton's three-years enlistment scheme, and to the heavy reductions made by the present Secretary of State for War. And with regard to the Home Defence Army, the people have also been made to believe that an inefficient and in sufficient Volunteer Force can, by a change of name and organisation, become an efficient and sufficient Territorial Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01722">What, my Lords, was Lord Haldane's ideal, and what were the conditions, four in number, I think, on the fulfilment of which the success of that ideal depended? Was not the ideal which the noble Viscount put before us in such eloquent and persuasive language, and which he called upon his countrymen to work up to and make a reality, "A Nation in Arms"? A trained Army of seven, or eight, or even nine hundred thousand men, which number he calculated that the enthusiasm and national spirit to be aroused in the country would enable him to reach; with military training for the boys in the schools, with cadet corps for the youths, and with rifle clubs for all classes to teach them how to shoot. It was a dazzling picture that was presented to the country, and one likely to be admiringly and willingly accepted by those who do not understand that "A Nation in Arms" which does not know how to use its arms would be of no value as a means of expansion in time of war, and could do little or nothing to prevent an invasion of this country by a considerably smaller number of highly trained soldiers. Well, my Lords, what have we got after more than three years of waiting for the realisation of this fine ideal? Instead of the seven, or eight, or nine hundred thousand trained men hoped for, we have less than two hundred
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0439"/>
<col>827</col>
and seventy thousand, all practically untrained, with the Infantry unable to shoot, with the Artillery unacquainted with the rudiments of their branch of the service, armed with an inferior gun, and, except in a very few cases, entirely dependent upon hired horses, and, as regards the Yeomanry, with, at the outside, one horse to every three men. We must not flatter ourselves that, because the Territorials can "march past" on Salisbury Plain and take part in peace man&#x0153;uvres, they can be trusted in the field, and that because we are told there are so many thousand horses in the country for the Yeomanry they will be of any use in time of war. Neither men nor horses are of the slightest value for war purposes unless, as I have frequently said, they are properly trained; unless the Infantry can use their rifles with skill; unless the Artillery can work their guns rapidly and scientifically; and unless the Yeomanry can shoot as well as the Infantry, and are mounted upon horses they are accustomed to ride and know how to look after. Then, my Lords, the promised military training in the schools for boys has not been given, no cadet corps have been organised by the State for youths, and no rifle clubs exist, except those maintained by private people, who have come to realise the danger of our men being unable to shoot.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01723">Now, my Lords, we come to the four conditions upon the fulfilment of which the success of Lord Haldane's scheme depended. The first condition was that the required number of men would be found to come forward on the voluntary system. This condition, as we know, after three years' hard toil, and most loyal co-operation from civilians and soldiers alike, has completely broken down, and as Lord Portsmouth, Lord Lovat, Lord Derby, Lord Esher, and other noble Lords, who have worked so enthusiastically in connection with the County Associations, pointed out in this House on July 18 last, and as Lord Esher has more recently explained in an article in the <i>National Review</i>, we cannot hope under the voluntary system to get a Territorial Force larger than we now have. It is because I was confident that this would be the case and also because I knew the requirements of war, that I reluctantly felt obliged to refuse to take any part in the organisation and administration of the Territorial Force. I thoroughly appreciate the value of the foundation upon which Lord Haldane has endeavoured to form a Home Defence Army, and it would
<col>828</col>
have been a real pleasure to me to have helped him to construct "an adequate edifice upon that foundation"; but I had no hopes of that being possible under the voluntary system, and I could not make myself believe that it was my duty to encourage a scheme which I was satisfied could never give us the Army we need. At the same time, my Lords, I can quite understand why men, who have had little or no war experience, considered it was their duty to do all in their power when the scheme was first started to make it a success by joining the Territorial Force or by becoming presidents and members of the County Associations. I have, however, looked forward with considerable anxiety, not to say impatience, to the clay when they would realise the mistake they were making, for I felt that so long as they gave the scheme their powerful support it was hopeless to expect that the country would understand that we had not got the Army that was wanted, and it was an intense relief to me when the noble Lords I have mentioned expressed their opinions so clearly as to the shortcomings of the Territorial Force. No one can now say with truth that the voluntary system for the Home Defence Army has not been given a fair and prolonged trial. The first condition&#x2014;that the required number of men would come forward on the voluntary principle&#x2014;cannot be said to be fulfilled, and those who are determined to continue to trust to that principle must, I think, either disbelieve in these islands ever requiring to be defended, or be foolish enough to imagine that men who have never been taught to fight can hold their own against highly trained soldiers, simply because they are their own countrymen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01724">The second condition was, as your Lordships no doubt remember, that we must have command of the sea. It is essential, my Lords, that we should have command of the sea, indeed our very existence depends upon our being supreme at sea; about this there ought to be no doubt. Whether we still have command of the sea in the true sense of the word, and if not to what extent we can claim that command, I do not feel competent to give an opinion, but of this I am certain, that however limited that extent may be, in order to ensure our supremacy over it at all times and under all circumstances, it is necessary that our ships should not be tied to these shores. On sea, as on land, it is the ability to attack that ensures success. It is unnecessary for me

to remind your Lordships that the fleets of other nations are rapidly approaching our fleets in the number, speed, and power of their warships; and what I would beg of you to note is, for it is the <i>crux</i> of the whole situation, that other nations are not dependent upon their navies for their food as we are upon our Navy; their fleets can be concentrated in any one direction, while a large proportion of our Navy must necessarily always be engaged in protecting the vessels conveying the required supplies, without the regular arrival of which we should either starve or be forced to make an ignominious peace.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01725">As I said once before in this House, we have nothing to guide us as to what the result of a battle at sea might be under the altered conditions of modern warfare. We have no practical knowledge of the part which torpedo-boats and submarines may be able to take in war, and even if our ships were more numerous and more powerful than those which could be brought against us, it is within the bounds of possibility that we might meet with a temporary defeat, and thus give the opportunity for a fleet of hostile transports to reach our coasts. I am aware, my Lords, that the Admiralty authorities take a different view. The First Sea Lord is quite confident that nothing of the sort could occur, as he has explained in the Memorandum added to the second edition of the book written by General Sir Ian Hamilton, with an introduction by Lord Haldane, entitled' "Compulsory Service." But, according to Sir Arthur Wilson, the enemy is to be so considerate as to carry out the invasion exactly in the manner we would wish, and where we are prepared to meet it. Surprise is left out of the calculation. Our information is to be absolutely perfect. We are to have the benefit of wireless telegraphy, scouting ships, submarines, &amp;c. Apparently, all these assets are to be denied to the enemy. He is to know nothing of our movements. A quite unnecessary number of transports are to be employed for the conveyance of the invading force, and they are all to come by the same route in order to make a better target for our warships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01726">I confess I cannot be so optimistic. I am obliged to think that the commander of an invading force may not fall in with all our arrangements for his reception. I cannot believe that he will not have as good, if not better, information of our plans than
<col>830</col>
we have of his, or that he will not have the benefit of wireless telegraphy, scouting ships, and submarines, or t hat his force&#x2014;the avowed object of which would be to subdue this country&#x2014;would not consist of more than 70,000 men, the maximum number laid down by the Secretary of State for War and the First Sea Lord. I should hardly have ventured to speak with such confidence on the naval side of this question had I not the support of many distinguished naval officers. No fewer than four Admirals of the Fleet and sixty-nine Admirals are at the present time members of the National Service League, and surely these officers would not have joined the league did they not feel strongly as to the necessity for this country being protected by a land force in order to admit of the Navy being liberated to perform its legitimate duties on the open seas. To give to our Navy this required freedom of movement, and to prevent the landing of an invading force, we must have an adequate home Army, and, so long as we remain without such an Army, the second condition&#x2014;that we must have command of the sea&#x2014;cannot be considered as fulfilled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01727">The third condition has now to be considered, which was that the invading force would not consist of more than 70,000 men, and that, therefore, we need not be prepared to cope with a larger number. How can we possibly lay down what the strength of an invading force would be? Six years ago we were told that not even a dinghy load of men could be landed on these shores. A little later we were informed that two raids of 5,000 men each were the outside we had to guard against. Then in 1909, on a reconsideration of the problem, it was agreed, both by the Prime Minister and Mr. Balfour, in the debate that took place in the House of Commons on July 9, that 70,000 was the number we had to be prepared for. I do not see, my Lords, how we can settle the exact number of men an invading force would consist of Surely that would depend upon a variety of circumstances about which we can have but little knowledge, and over which we can have absolutely no control. The only thing we may feel confident of is, that the better prepared we are the less chance there is of an invasion being attempted. The figure of 70,000 seems to have been fixed upon because, as explained by Mr. Balfour, that was the minimum number with which I myself stated, at a meeting of the Committee
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0441"/>
<col>831</col>
of Imperial Defence in 1905, I believed any commander would venture to attempt an invasion of this country. And also because the naval authorities asserted that the transports required for a larger number would be so numerous as to make it impossible for them to evade our warships. But my opinion is that an invading force is far more likely to consist of 150,000 men than 70,000, and that it is for this number, at least, we ought to be prepared. Naval and mercantile arrangements are day by day becoming more perfect, and, for the short distance that would have to be traversed, 150,000 men could now be conveyed without risk or inconvenience in considerably fewer ships than it was calculated six years ago would be necessary for the conveyance of 70,000. It does not appear, therefore, my Lords, that the third condition&#x2014;viz., that an invading force would consist of not more than 70,000 men&#x2014;is any more likely of fulfilment than the first and second conditions. On all the occasions when these statements were made as to the numbers we might expect an invasion to consist of, we were led to believe that our Army was exactly what was needed at that precise moment, and yet, my Lords, while the numbers of the invading force rose from less than a dinghy load to 70,000 men our Home Defence Army steadily decreased in strength.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01728">Now, my Lords, we have arrived at the fourth condition, which was that the Expeditionary Force would be kept in this country for six months after war had been declared, during which time the Home Defence Army could be trained. This is the most astonishing and fallacious condition of the four, and it is difficult to believe that the Secretary of State could ever have contemplated organising an Army for the defence of this country on such a condition, unless it had been forced upon him by those of his supporters who scout the necessity for having an Army at all, and had not Lord Haldane, in the House of Commons on March 4, 1907, given it as his opinion that "under the voluntary system the required amount of training could never be given in time of peace." I quite agree with Lord Haldane that under the voluntary system the required amount of training could never be given in time of peace, for the simple reason that the men who join the Territorial Force cannot afford the necessary time. But what I venture to assert is that the training could never be given after war
<col>832</col>
breaks out, because it would be impossible to keep our absurdly small Expeditionary Force, or any portion of it, in this country for six months if serious trouble broke out in India, in Egypt, or in any of our oversea Dominions. I need not dwell on the reasons which make it impossible, as I explained them fully when last I spoke in this House, so I will only say that, in the event of the Expeditionary Force being required to help our countrymen and women abroad, no thought of our personal safety could stand in the way of every available soldier being instantly despatched, for it is upon this help in time of need they confidently rely. Our honour would be at stake as well as our feelings of humanity. And if our Regular Army were required to assist in preserving the balance of power in Europe, upon the maintenance of which not only our position as a Great Power but our existence as a nation depends, it would be equally impossible to keep the Expeditionary Force at home. Therefore, I think you must agree with me that this fourth condition, upon which the training of the Territorial Force can alone be accomplished, is even more impossible of fulfilment than the other three conditions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01729">If, then, the four conditions upon which the success of Lord Haldane's scheme depends cannot be fulfilled, what is to be done? We cannot go on as we are, for, as I have said, we have neither a Home Army, such as is needed for the defence of this country, nor an effective Regular Army to protect Imperial interests abroad. The Regular portion of our Army (all, I think, will agree) must be formed on a voluntary basis, and in my opinion&#x2014;an opinion considerably strengthened by reading "Compulsory Service"&#x2014;there are no grounds for fearing that this would be interfered with if it were decided to adopt a compulsory basis for the Home Defence portion of our Army. The object of Sir Ian Hamilton's book is to try to prove that compulsory training would adversely affect recruiting for the Regular Army, but I venture to think it would require sounder arguments than are adduced in that book to convince the most casual reader that this view is correct. The fears of the Secretary of State for War and the gallant General are certainly not borne out by history or by our own experience, as I have endeavoured to show in "Fallacies and Facts," the recently published answer to "Compulsory Service."</p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0442"/>
<col>833</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01730">We require, my Lords, one million of men&#x2014;over and above the Regular Army&#x2014;-the smallest number that would prevent invasion being attempted, and at the same time furnish a potential Reserve from which a large proportion of the men, who had been taught their duty as soldiers, could be depended to come forward of their own accord to serve with the Regular Army fighting abroad. The question, the vital question, upon which the country has to pronounce, is how this million of men are to be obtained, and in what way the required amount of training can be carried out with the least inconvenience to the general public. On the conclusion of their training the men would revert to civil life&#x2014;better physically, industrially, and morally, for their short experience of the Army&#x2014;and ready to take their part in any great national emergency that may arise. We were told a few months ago by Lord Ashby St. Ledgers that the country would not accept the obligation of compulsory training, except as the result of a national disaster. I wonder if the noble Lord has ever explained to the people, or pictured to himself, what a national disaster would mean? Whether he has ever given a thought as to the terms to which we might be forced to submit, if dictated to us by an invader on our own soil? We surely do not intend to wait until some great disaster&#x2014;a Jena or a Sedan&#x2014;brings home to us that we are not different from other nations, and that if we do not make ourselves strong on land as well as on sea, we cannot hope to escape the fate which has overtaken all great flourishing commercial maritime Powers which neglected that duty. It may be urged that these were Continental, not island, Powers, and that therefore the analogy does not hold good, but, although no doubt our insular position is an advantage in some respects, it is a disadvantage inasmuch as it makes us dependent for our food on foreign countries. And I submit that our tremendous land responsibilities in various parts of the world prevent us now being considered as altogether an island Power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01731">I fear that I have already taken up too much time, but, if you will bear with me for a few minutes longer, I should like to explain why I am so persistent in my endeavours to get our people to realise the absolute necessity for the men to whom we have to trust to defend this
<col>834</col>
country and to fight our battles abroad being in all respects well disciplined and properly trained. Insufficiently disciplined and insufficiently trained men, however keen, however numerically superior they may be, cannot nowadays be relied upon to hold their own against highly trained soldiers. They could not be relied upon, even before the days of arms of precision, and they most certainly cannot be relied upon now. All the talk about one volunteer being worth two pressed men "is sheer nonsense. The truth is that one man, whether pressed or not, if well disciplined and carefully trained, is worth at least half-a-dozen undisciplined, insufficiently trained volunteers. No doubt if I had to lead a forlorn hope requiring men determined to carry out the job, no matter what the odds against them might be, I would rather have half the number of men w ho volunteered than double the number ordered to perform it, provided all were equally well trained. But if it were a question of soldiers <i>versus</i> untrained volunteers, I would infinitely prefer to have ten well-trained and well-disciplined soldiers than fifty ill-trained and ill-disciplined volunteers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01732">If time admitted I could give you many instances from history in support of this view&#x2014;the opinions of great commanders like Washington and Napoleon&#x2014;hilt it will, perhaps, interest you more if I remind you of an incident well within the recollection of many in this House, and tell you something of what I know from my own experience of war. During the Franco-German War of 1870&#x2013;71, the French, from having an army without any means of expansion, were forced, after the first few weeks, to employ hastily raised levies. These levies, even in greatly superior numbers, were no match for the highly-trained German soldiers. On one occasion towards the end of the war, 35,000 German soldiers found themselves engaged with a force of these recently raised levies, numbering between 140,000 and 150,000. They had been given such training as was possible while war was going on, for four and a half months. They were brave men fighting for their own country, and in their own country, and what happened? Within a month 60,000 of them were killed, wounded, poisoners, or missing, while the remaining 80,000 were driven over the Swiss frontier and there interned.</p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0443"/>
<col>835</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01733">When giving my own experience about what happened in South Africa, I desire to speak with the utmost respect of the fine patriotic spirit which induced the one man out of five of the Militia, the one man out of fifteen of the Yeomanry and Volunteers, and the one man in a thousand out of the civil population to come forward to serve with the Army during the war. They set an excellent example to their comrades, and they deserve all praise for their courage and willingness to help their country in her time of need. That these men were unable to hold their own&#x2014;unless aided by Regular soldiers&#x2014;even against an enemy so lightly trained as the Boers, was not due to any fault of their own, but to the absurdly foolish belief which then existed, and which, I deeply regret to say, still exists amongst a great many people who ought to know better, that untrained, undisciplined citizen soldiers, unable to use their rifles with effect, and worse than all led by officers without military training, can be trusted in war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01734">For not a few of the "regrettable incidents" which occurred during the South African war this country was to blame, not the men, for the men were never given the opportunity to learn their duty as soldiers. And I would ask you what in all human probability would have been the fate of these same men had they been fighting against the highly-trained soldiers of a Continental Power? Is this country going to allow these things to happen again? Is it willing to consent to untrained men meeting the fate that befell the French levies? There was, perhaps, some excuse for untrained men being sent to South Africa. We had not been engaged in, any serious war for nearly half a century, and it was not then generally understood that owing to the introduction of rifled arms and smokeless powder war had become more scientific and that a much higher standard of individual intelligence and efficiency had come to be demanded both from officers and men. I know from my own experience that fifty years ago soldiers with far less individual training than is now necessary could be trusted to do well in battle. At that time fighting was carried on in close formations. Officers, non-commissioned officers, and men were all within touch of each other, and shooting took quite a secondary place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01735">Those of your Lordships who have been over the field of Waterloo or seen the model
<col>836</col>
of that great battle in the Royal United Service Institution in London can judge for yourselves what fighting in close formation meant. The English and French armies each numbered between 70,000 and 80,000 men. The length of the front occupied was about three miles, but the fighting chiefly took place in one mile and a half. And throughout the whole of that eventful day, except for a very short time, Wellington and Napoleon were never more than three-quarters of a mile apart. Owing to the altered conditions of modern warfare, such a battle would at the present time be impossible. An army of the size that Wellington and Napoleon each commanded at Waterloo would now occupy a front of about twelve miles, or nearly four times the length of the ground that was occupied on that occasion, and instead of the Infantry soldiers in close order firing at each other from a distance of forty or fifty yards, as was the case at Waterloo, they would be compelled to open out and adopt loose formations as soon as they entered the zone of fire. The extent of the zone of fire depends in a great measure upon the nature of the ground and the accuracy of the enemy's fire, but is usually now from 1,800 to 2,000 yards. Officers get separated from the men and the men from each other, consequently the strain on the individual man becomes far greater than in old days when he had the support of close contact with his comrades and knew that his officers were near at hand to guide him. The effect of these changes is to make it imperative for soldiers to be highly trained, otherwise they can be of no use in modern war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01736">My Lords, I have given you my reasons for the statement I made that we have neither a Home Army such as is needed for the defence of this country, nor an effective Regular Army to protect our Imperial interests abroad. If this statement is not accepted by the Secretary of State for War, I beg that your Lordships will not be content with a mere counter-statement, accompanied as it probably will be by a bewildering array of figures. My statement is based -upon facts&#x2014;facts that are strictly true&#x2014;and unless these facts can be proved to be untrue, I think your Lordships must agree with me that the safety of the country demands that the condition of the Army should be inquired into&#x2014;not by a Royal Commission or by any Commission, which would probably have no more satisfactory result than the two former Royal
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0444"/>
<col>837</col>
Commissions&#x2014;but by a small Committee of experts who have no axe to grind, and who would have the confidence of the public. I beseech you, my Lords, to support me on this vitally important question. It is essentially a national not a Party question, and I trust that it will not be allowed to drop without the electors of this country being put in possession of your individual opinions as to the Motion T have brought forward, and without their being enlightened as to the true state of the Army.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01737">I began this long speech by a reference to the optimistic and hopeful discourses upon the peace of the world to which we have listened of late. I am old enough to remember the enthusiasm excited on a somewhat similar occasion, sixty years ago. Then, as now, we were besieged from every pulpit, from every newspaper, by aspirations and promises of an immedate future in which our swords would be beaten into ploughshares and our spears into pruning hooks. This was in the year 1851&#x2014;the year in which I got my commission. My Lords, there was not a single year in the next two decades that was not marked by some war in one portion of the globe or another. In 1852 we were fighting in Burma. In 1853 the Tsar Nicholas seized the Danubian Provinces&#x2014;the beginning of the Crimean War. That was scarcely ended when we had to face the Indian Mutiny. In 1839 France and Italy were at war. In 1860 we were fighting in China; and in 1862 in New Zealand. In the following year we heard of Bull's Run, and Lee, Lincoln, and Stonewall Jackson became household words. In 1864 there was the Danish War. In 1866 the six weeks' war, which was but a prelude to one of the most heroic struggles of modern days&#x2014;the Franco-German War of 1870&#x2013;71.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01738">Let us by all means listen to the aspirations and reasonings of the advocates of universal peace, and do all in our power to help but in the meantime, warned by what followed the prophetic outburst of 1851, let us in all respects be ready for war. There is no time to be lost if our Army is to be made fit for war. My deliberate opinion is that, while other nations are daily and steadily becoming stronger and more powerful, we are daily and steadily losing ground. Our margin of safety on the sea is rapidly disappearing, and should war come upon us with the startling rapidity with which it has come upon other nations in recent years, we shall be found absolutely
<col>838</col>
unprepared. Therefore I beg to move the Motion standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01739">Moved to resolve, That, in view of the altered strategic conditions in Europe, this House views with grave and growing concern the inadequate military arrangements of His Majesty's Government for the defence of this country and of His Majesty's Oversea Dominions.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Roberts.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01740"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the early part of the speech to which your Lordships have listened with such close attention the noble and gallant Field-Marshal dwelt on what he considered to be the shortcomings of the existing military organisation. In the second part of his speech he indicated the reforms which he considered necessary in order to put that organisation on a sufficient basis. In the observations I propose to address to your Lordships I will, for the purposes of convenience, invert the order awl consider first somewhat closely what the noble and gallant Field-Marshal adumbrated as the changes lie wished to make, and then the reasons why it seems to me that the existing system is preferable. But before I do so there is one thing I would wish to say. I would rather not have found myself on what is practically my first appearance in your Lordships' House in opposition to one for whom I entertain such feelings of affectionate regard as I do for my noble friend. No one connected with the British Army but can hold him in reverence. His name is associated with great and illustrious deeds, and so long as our history is recorded we shall remember that he carried our cause to victory under difficult and trying circumstances.<lb/>
The Motion which my noble and gallant friend has moved asserts that, owing to the strategical change in the situation in Europe we are no longer in possession of military arrangements adequate for home defence or for the defence of the Dominions oversea. There is one factor which remains of the same strategical effect as it always was. Between us and any possible Continental enemy there intervenes a strip of sea, the same strip of sea which existed in the time of our ancestors. Between the Army and the Navy there exists a considerable divergence of view as to the possibility of an enemy crossing that strip of sea. It is held by sailors that so long as we retain the command of the sea an invasion in force is
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0445"/>
<col>839</col>
practically impossible. A century ago a great Admiral, Lord St. Vincent, addressed your Lordships' House in a debate not unlike the present one. Having listened to the speeches he rose and said that he had considered the military opinions that were expressed, and would not himself give expression to any view upon them; but he could assure their Lordships that if an invading army ever arrived, it would not be by sea. That has been the opinion of sailors right through. I have myself sat upon two Committees which have been directed to investigate this question. After protracted sittings extending over months, and after examining all the witnesses, we came unanimously to the conclusion on both occasions that the Navy view was right. I was myself much impressed with this&#x2014;that the question of invasion was very much more technical and difficult than it is apt to appear to soldiers. Some seaman once remarked that when a soldier went below low-water mark on the beach he was apt to get out of his depth; and I own that my experience on those Committees of the sifting of the conflicting views which we then had before us impressed me with this&#x2014;that the matter is one to which the Admiralty have given at all times of our history long and thorough consideration, and is one on which their record entitles them to speak with an authority which no soldier can challenge.<lb/>
But I do not desire at this moment to dwell on that point. I wish to turn back to the propositions expressed by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. What is the standard by which he asks your Lordships to judge, and by which he invites you to affirm or deny the proposition which he submits to the House? Unless we know what that standard is we cannot bring his reasons to the test. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal developed to some extent his remedy for the existing situation in the light of standards which seem to hint to be true standards; but, as he himself said, he has set these things out more completely in the book which he has recently published. I refer to the book, not in terms of reproach; rather I welcome my noble friend as a fellow author. In his book we have a much more detailed statement of the standards which he washes to apply and the changes which he desires to bring about. I remember a debate which took place in this House on the Motion by the noble Earl for the Second Reading of a Bill to establish compulsory
<col>840</col>
military training. That Motion was opposed by the Duke of Northumberland on the ground that, while the Bill was, as he said, a very small one, it gave sonic taste of the quality of the medicine; and he was afraid that the plan proposed in the Bill would develop into a much larger scheme than one for training Infantry for four months and other arms for six months. If the noble Duke were here this evening he would find that he was a true prophet for quite early in his book the noble and gallant Field-Marshal speaks of the profound discontent which is felt in the Army with the proposition of the National Service League that the training of the Infantry should be for four months only. He goes on to say that the National Service League has no special predilection for the four months period. Its desire, he says, is&#x2014;
<quote>"to see the principle of universal service for home defence accepted, as it seems to its members that if this great principle once gets the consent of a majority of the people there will be no difficulty in adjusting the details of the scheme which will he necessary to reduce theory to practice."</quote>
I am not complaining of that. If compulsory service be necessary for the defence of these shores I think the nation would say, "Let us have compulsory service, and let us have the training for what soldiers say is the proper time&#x2014;that is, two years."<lb/>
The noble and gallant Field-Marshal goes on to say in his book&#x2014;
<quote>"If this course it&#x0021;adopted it will carry with it, not only its; own consequences, but an extensive reorganisation of the Regular Army."</quote>
I wish to call attention to the length to which that reorganisation seems to go. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal does not pin himself to any particular form, but lie indicates that what he favours is the separation of the Regular Army into a long service Army and a short-service Army, and a scheme which is not unlike that of the late Mr. Arnold-Forster for a compulsory Home Defence Army at the basis which is to form a reservoir out of which the volunteers for the two branches of the Regular Army for the future are to come. He goes on to say that not the command of the sea but our military allies enabled us to maintain the balance of power in Europe, and that now we need an Army of our own to do this. That proposition, he agrees, involves a radical reorganisation of our Regular Army and our Home Defence Army alike.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0446"/>
<col>841</col>
These are far-reaching propositions. He refers to Part II of his book&#x2014;a part written by an expert&#x2014;as containing the broad outlines and general features of the kind of reorganisation which he desires to see. I turn to Part II, which develops with great fulness the standard which the writer wishes to be set up as the standard by which to test the sufficiency of our existing arrangements, and, secondly, the plan by which he proposes to bring the military and naval organisations, for both are included, up to that standard. I refer to this because, from various remarks in the book, I infer that my noble friend does not dissent from the propositions advanced in Part II of the book. The first proposition is that, alike for service oversea and for home defence, our present military arrangements are wholly inadequate and powers of expansion are essential. And then he lays down the standard&#x2014;
<quote>"The main lines of our naval and military organisations must take no account&#x2014;</quote>
I ask your Lordships' attention to this&#x2014;
<quote>"of present international relations, but must be laid with a view to dealing with any Power with which the Empire can possibly come into contact by sea or on laud. There can be no such thing in sound strategy as the exclusion from our calculations of any foreign Power, however friendly at the moment or however much we may dislike the idea of coming into conflict with it."</quote>
Further&#x2014;
<quote>"The danger of finding ourselves at war with more than one Great Power at a time must be reckoned as a permanent factor in the situation, awl all naval and military preparations must take account of it."</quote>
"The command of the sea," he says, is not enough, "for this is not an end in itself"; and he contends that we want&#x2014;
<quote>"an army strong enough to redress the balance of power in Europe against the premeditated Continental domination of a single Power."</quote>
Then he asks what is the case in the way of our naval strength. The writer says that the two-Power standard means Navy Estimates of from &#x00A3;60,000,000 to &#x00A3;80,000,000&#x2014;that it is no use our gasping over this; and that the great wars for which we must prepare are, first, with Russia, for the defence of India; second, with the United States for the defence of Canada; and also possibly with Turkey for the defence of Egypt, with Japan, and with a European combination possibly of Germany, Austria, and Italy. He lays Clown that as the standard, and proceeds to develop his plan in the form of a new
<col>842</col>
Army scheme. It involves the abolition of the Cardwell system, with certain limitations to which I will refer presently. In the first place our oversea garrisons and soldiers in different parts of the Empire overseas are all to be long-service soldiers, enrolled for twenty-one years. They are to be got by voluntary service, and there will be no Reserves. In addition, there is to be a striking force of 40,000 men, of twenty-one years service. That brings you up to nearly 150,000 long-service men on a twenty-one years' basis. Then there is to be a short-service Army, the Infantry trained for one year and the other arms for eighteen months or two years. This is to be a voluntary force, but indirect compulsion will be used to assist in raising it. Then there is to be a national service, in which every young man eighteen years of age is to undergo from four to six months' training; and while in that force he will be paid not more than 6d. a day or possibly nothing at all according to the writer. It is predicted that large numbers will volunteer for the short-service Army, which is to be an oversea A-my and to produce a strength of 300,000 men. Of course, its peace establishment will not be nearly so large as that, but it is to mobilise at a strength of 300,000 men, and that is to take the place of the Expeditionary Force. Then the National Service Army is to consist of about 1,000,000 men, from whom the 300,000 are to be found.<lb/>
Let us compare the Expeditionary Force with the National Service Army. In the Expeditionary Force you have got a force which, if small&#x2014;it does not mobilise more than 170.000 men&#x2014;consists on the average of highly trained and seasoned men who have had seven years' service with the Colours. Compare them with the 300,000 men spoken of. They will have had only one year's training. I am talking of the Infantry. After one year's training they go into the Reserve, and you have to make up the number of 300,000 with Reservists poured into the peace strength, which is something far under 100,000. These men will have had only one year's training, with refresher courses which are not indicated but are left to be developed in the future. I ask, Is that an Army that can be compared for quality with the Expeditionary Force which we have to-day Supposing they have to be sent to the Continent. It is contrary to all notions of military efficiency to put as your First Line Army
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0447"/>
<col>843</col>
to meet the shock of Continental trained troops men who have had only one year's training with these vague refresher courses. I believe that if this doctrine were taken seriously it would spread alarm and consternation throughout the Army, because it would be felt that what is best in the Army&#x2014;those splendid troops which we now possess&#x2014;would be reduced in quality, and that instead of being made better by the increase in numbers the Army would be reduced to a position of great inferiority, not only as compared with its present standard but as compared with the troops whom they might have to encounter. Then there are other difficulties. Where are the officers to come from? Where am I to get the enormous increase of officers that would be necessary for the training of a force of this magnitude? They do not exist at the present time. Remember you are not offering a very attractive service. The only answer, with regard to officers, which the writer gives, is that a national system creates its own officers. I hope so. But that is all the comfort we are given.<lb/>
Then, I ask, how does this work out in finance? I am not raising the question of money as though it were the paramount question. It is not. If our lives are at stake we will use up the last resources of the nation before we allow ourselves to perish. But in the case of a proposition for the reorganisation and recasting of the Military and Naval Forces in a time of peace&#x2014;for that is what it comes to&#x2014;we must take into account the burden which it is proposed to impose on our people by this new system. The Naval Estimates are proposed to be increased from the present &#x00A3;44,000.000 to the figure of from &#x00A3;60,000,000 to &#x00A3;80,000,000, at which we are told we need not gasp. As regards the Military Estimates we have no material for calculation. But after going into the matter as closely as I can I can only say I should not like to contract to produce an Army of one million men and to keep it alive under a figure of &#x00A3;40,000,000.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01742"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It is for the entire Army Estimates, both for the National Service Army and the other Army. The writer says one million men
<col>844</col>
would probably be sufficient. But he goes on to qualify this by saying that we might have to take on not only all those Powers which he has mentioned <i>seriatim</i>, but all of them at once. Therefore his estimate is certainly not more than would be sufficient. I cannot help thinking that with the Naval and Military Estimates proposed to be raised to &#x00A3;100,000,000 there is something that would happen before we could use that force in any war. We should probably find ourselves in a condition in which the intellectual and material resources of the country would be so diminished that something like bankruptcy would be staring us in the face. I cannot help thinking of what was said by the great soldier Von Moltke, when in 1865 it was proposed to him that his scheme for the reorganisation of the Prussian Army did not provide for the contingency of Russia, France, and Austria attacking Germany at the same time. His reply was&#x2014;
<quote>"No; I have not provided for such a thing to happen if it did happen, Germany would have to defend herself as best she could."</quote>
To associate the Army in the minds of the people with such an enormous scheme as this seems to me, unless we are driven to it by necessity, to be doing what Wellington declared would be the worst thing that could be done in the interest of the Army&#x2014;namely, to associate it in the public mind with extravagance.<lb/>
The sincerity of the noble Field-Marshal is beyond all question. We all know with what passionate devotion he has worked for his cause. But what I venture to call the fallacy of his reasoning seems to be this&#x2014;that he is insisting upon preparing for the logically possible instead of for the reasonably probable. If you take the first course, then you will have to be prepared for conflict with a combination of all sorts of Powers beyond anything which has hitherto come into question, and the result is that you prove either too little or too much. I could quote a combination of Powers of which my noble friend does not speak in his book, and against which his plans do not provide, a combination against which we should be in such a state of unpreparedness that in the words of Von Moltke we should have to defend ourselves as best we could. But what is the present position? Remember that just at this moment we are engaged in communication with the United States of America in relation to a possible Treaty
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0448"/>
<col>845</col>
of General Arbitration. The German Chancellor in the speech to which the noble Earl referred spoke of the willingness of his country to exchange naval information with this country, a course which, if taken, must tend in some degree to reduce the risk of scares, which have done so much to force up the Naval Estimates, not only in this country, but in other countries.<lb/>
Moreover, with France and Russia we are in agreement, and a war in defence of the Indian frontier against Russia appears less likely now than it has appeared for generations. So far as the rest of the world is concerned the peoples of all lands are beginning to show signs of a desire that this tremendous burden of armaments should, if possible, be diminished rather than increased. Is this, then, the time when, if you take the standard of the reasonably probable, it is desirable to take the step we are asked to take? And if you take the standard of the logically possible what an example we should be setting to other nations at a time when, as we all hope, we are seeing a real beginning in a new movement for the world's peace. I have always thought that the true Commander of the Forces in this country, naval and military, is not the sailor or the soldier but the Foreign Secretary. On him it depends what our outlook is likely to be. I agree that we must defend our rights and be in a position to secure ourselves against defeat. But, atter all, you have to choose between a good many things in this world, for you cannot have them all. You cannot have prosperity and be crushed down in a time of peace by a burden of armaments which is only fitted for a time of war. You must take some risks. All the things of which the noble Earl spoke are, of course, logically possible. It is logically possible that one of your Lordships may be killed by a motor-car in crossing the street. But you do not refuse to go out for that reason. Nor do you decline to take a journey in a railway train because it is logically possible that there may be an accident. These things are things which you may exclude from the consideration in the handling of practical affairs, and you are brought, therefore, to the standard of the reasonably probable.<lb/>
There are certain things which are not without a material bearing in considering what our military and naval organisation ought to be. In the first place, this island is the centre of an Empire the parts of
<col>846</col>
which are separated from each other by great stretches of the sea. The command of the sea must, therefore, be our first requisite. There, again, your standard must be any reasonably probable combination of the forces you may have to face. It may be a three-Power standard or a two-Power standard. The next point is that if you possess the command of the sea you can make sea-power your first line of defence against invasion, and that is what we have always done and ought always to do. If we command the German Ocean the difficulties of an enemy's commander seeking to transport troops across that sea can best be realised by anybody who attempts to put himself in the place of that commander. All the changes of recent times&#x2014;wireless telegraphy and other variations from the old condition of things&#x2014;are in favour of the de 'ending nation. Naval dispositions to-day do not merely depend on the mobility of squadrons of battleships. There is a second line of naval defence&#x2014;the destroyer and submarine organisation along our coasts, which is ready to torpedo transports even if they evade the mobile squadrons which are watching them.<lb/>
But is it likely that the transports will evade those squadrons? My noble friend spoke of the great facilities for transport which exist to-day. The movements of every ship even in time of peace are minutely recorded by agencies, and the Admiralty would be informed of the least departure from the ordinary course. Before a liner could be got oft with troops it is certain that warning to be on the alert would have reached us. Not only is that so in the case of individual ships, but still more is it the case with transports on any large scale. It is a difficult operation, even with the most perfect preparations on the other side of the water, to embark troops and get the vessels started without intimation being given either through commercial channels or by wireless telegraphy of what is happening. We are not to suppose that our Navy and the Admiralty are so stupid as not to be aware of all this. For years past&#x2014;I might almost say generations past&#x2014;they have realised the importance of these matters; and I have good ground for believing that they have never been more fully realised than by the present experts of the Board of Admiralty.<lb/>
The justification for relying on what I call a Second Line Army for home defence
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0449"/>
<col>847</col>
arises out of the fact that the First Line is naval. Supposing a bolt to fall from the blue without warning; what would be our position? If the Expeditionary Force were at home, with other Regular troops, the Special Reserve, and the Territorials, we should have 580.000 men to receive the invaders. Suppose, however, the Expeditonary Force had gone abroad&#x2014;to India, for instance. Under the Act of 1907, unless the Government grossly failed in its duty, the Territorial Force would be mobilised at the moment of the mobilisation of the Regular Forces. The theory of the new Second Line Army is that you should never leave the country without an Army, and that yon should put one into war training as soon as the other is mobilised. The theory does not contemplate a Territorial Force which would become efficient in time of peace. The preparations that have been made are preparations for giving it as perfect an organisation as it is possible to give it, and enabling it by means of mobilisation on the Expeditionary Force's going abroad to progress in the perfecting of its war training. if the Expeditionary Force had gone abroad we should still have in the country from 416,000 to 420,000 men available, including a large number of surplus Reserves and the Special Reserve. That is a considerable force for an invading army to encounter. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal stated that the invading force might consist of more than 70,000 men. The Admiralty do not even admit the possibility of invasion by 70,000 men. That is a figure which is fixed because it is thought we ought to have two strings to our bow. In such a vital matter it is thought we ought to be so prepared as to force an enemy to come with not less than 70,000 men. The more men the enemy brings the larger the target for the Navy. With home defence resting on the command of the sea, we consider ourselves justified, taking into account the Reserve and other troops we should still have at home, in relying on a Territorial Force recruited by voluntary enlistment, and getting all the training they could in time of peace consistently with pursuing their ordinary vocations and improving it upon a general mobilisation.<lb/>
The third requisite of the present system is an over-sea force. But I must say a word further about the second Line troops. What is it my noble friend proposes to pit against the army of 150,000 invaders which he postulates? An army of 400,000 men,
<col>848</col>
according to the National Service League estimate, with four months' training. These would apparently be expected to resist Continental Infantry trained for two years. I do not feel quite convinced that the Territorial Force with the enormous burden of extra training it took over out of the fulness of the Volunteer spirit is not a good deal better than any four months' trained compulsory force is likely to be.<lb/>
There are many defects in the Territorial Force. We have not got our numbers vet. The main reason is, I think, that we have enjoyed the blessing&#x2014;not an unmixed blessing from an Army point of view&#x2014;of ten years' peace. In peace it is not easy to fill up your numbers, though they go up at once when war threatens. Still, the numbers are moving steadily, though slowly, according to the best judgment I can form from the reports that are sent in. We have at present five-sixths of the Force&#x2014;272,000 officers and men. Five-sixths of the Force is something to have got. If anybody thinks he can create within three years an Army of fourteen Divisions, an organised Army complete in all its accessories&#x2014;because that is what differentiates the Territorial Force entirely from the old Volunteers&#x2014;an Army commanded by Regular commanders, men who are picked for the ability with which they have discharged their duty in command of Regulars&#x2014;then he has a difficult business.<lb/>
I often think in dealing with the Territorial. Force it is well to look at what those say who study the matter most closely. A discussion took place last Tuesday&#x2014;reported in <i>The Times</i> of the following day&#x2014;at a meeting of the National Defence Association on the condition of the Territorial Force. Divisional commanders were invited and attended, and they were told to exercise perfect freedom of criticism. We take the view which is taken in Germany, that it is a good thing that our officers should have opportunities of making their views known. At that meeting Colonel Repington, who has made a close study of this Force, said of it&#x2014;
<quote>"The training and the amount of it had made great strides, and the Territorial Force appeared to be about three times as good as the old Volunteers, first, because it was well organised on the Regular pattern with all its arms and services, whereas the Volunteers were not organised at all; secondly, because it was better commanded, trained, and equipped, and had a definite <i>r&#x00F3;le</i> in the defence of the country; and, thirdly, because it had fewer wasters."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0450"/>
<col>849</col>
And then he concluded&#x2014;
<quote>"Broadly speaking and. taking a general average, three Territorial battalions were at present about the military equivalent of one Regular battalion, and at the end of six months' training the proportion would be reduced to two to one, given good training ground, ranges, Regular commanders from the active list, and Regular Staff. With the same conditions a Territorial Artillery brigade of three batteries, each of four guns, ought after three to four mouths' training and practice to hold its own with a six-gnu Regular battery. The Yeomanry he considered equal to about half its number of Regular Cavalry, but after three months' training might face with credit nearly equal numbers."</quote>
That is conjecture, but it is the conjecture of a man who has given close attention and scrutiny to this Force. General Bethune the Commander of the West Lancashire Division, for which he has done so much, said that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial Force in West Lancashire had increased in efficiency from top to bottom about 20 per cent. in each of the last two years. On February 1 they had an establishment of 481 out of 510 officers, and 15,609 out of 10,997 men, a proportion of 88 per cent. of strength. The men -were of a good stamp."</quote>
I mention these things not for the purpose of taking an optimistic view. Heaven knows I have to be optimistic enough going about the country to raise this Force. I am not here to be optimistic; I am here for the purpose of getting at the facts. I quite agree that there is an enormous lot to be done. All I say is I am not hopeless, as my noble friend is hopeless, of making anything out of the voluntary system. If I were, I confess I should feel myself in a position of very great difficulty, because what, is absolutely necessary is that we should have the garrisons of India and of our other places over-sets maintained at their present strength and quality, and my belief is&#x2014;and the same thing is true of the Expeditionary Force&#x2014;that you could not do that if you had a system of compulsory service PAM for home defence.<lb/>
There has been a great deal of criticism of Sir Ian Hamilition for the views which he has expressed. But, my Lords, Sir Ian Hamilition possesses one important qualification. He has been to the Continent and studied the problem of recruiting on the spot, and whether you take Germany, France, or Russia the testimony is unanimous that you cannot raise a compulsory and a voluntary army out of the same material at the same time; that as soon as you apply compulsion you set up a
<col>850</col>
certain ideal. We see it in other things. For example, we all pay taxes to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I am not sure that any of your Lordships&#x2014;certainly I do not&#x2014;offer any benevolences in addition. Whenever an ideal is set up by the State we are prone to take it as a part of our duty, and in no case is that proved to be more markedly so than in Germany with its great military system, a system which is very highly appreciated on the whole by the people of that country. On the Continent the experience seems to me to be conclusive that if we had the compulsory system we could not rely on getting that enormous stream of Volunteers which we require for keeping up what is a necessity of our Empire&#x2014;the greatest Army overseas maintained in peace that the world has ever seen, and, as I believe, the most efficient. But it is said, "You have not conclusively proved that you will not get them." The burden is not on me. I am content and thankful to be able to see the over-seas garrisons backed up anti the Expeditionary Army recruited as under the present system, and when I am asked to take to another system, that of compulsion, I have the feelings of a man who has a modest fortune invested in Consols on which he depends for his existence, and is invited to sell the Consols and invest the proceeds in a glittering gold mine of which he is handed the prospectus. My noble friend puts forward the prospectus, but that prospectus is not sufficiently attractive to induce me to sell out my Consols and invest my fortune, small though it may be, in his gold mine upon the inviting prospectus which be offers me.<lb/>
My Lords, it is a great thing to get your numbers in the way compulsory service gives them to you, but there are worse things than having to struggle for numbers. It would be a worse thing if you did not get your numbers at all. My noble friend says, "How short you are falling with voluntary service"; and he says that my original idea was to raise the peace establishment to 900,000 men in place of the miserable Territorial establishment of 300,000 to which I have been driven. But, my Lords, I never said that I proposed to raise a peace establishment of 900,000 men. What happened was this. A noble friend of mine, Lord Wemyss, in a speech he made said that I had said it, and it got all over the country, and I have never been able to get rid of it. I wrote a letter to <i>The</i>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0451"/>
<col>851</col>
<i>Times</i> which appeared about three years ago, and it is there for your Lordships to see, in which I quoted what T did say. The quotation by my noble friend was from a speech of mine at Newcastle in September, 1906, in which I said that in time of war if this country were invaded and if we had this Territorial Force and the County Associations the men would pass through the Territorial Force, and with the Special Reserve and the Regulars we had at home we should be able to develop in great stress of war and national necessity 700,000, 800,000, or even 900,000 men. I included, as your Lordships will observe, the Regulars and the Special Reserve in that. I say so now; but that has nothing to do with the peace organisation, and I take this opportunity of saying that never at any time was I sanguine enough to think that I could get anything like as much as 900,000 men on a voluntary basis. I make my noble friend a present of that admission.<lb/>
I have already detained your Lordships too long. What I feel is that we dare not try to organise a Continental army for this country. In the first place, I do not believe that the quality under my noble friend's plans would be nearly as good as that of the smaller Expeditionary Army of to-day, and, in the second place, you would imperil India and India is your greatest necessity. It is infinitely better to be weak from a military point of view on the Continent than to be weak in India. I am sure that our safest course, if India and the over-seas Colonies be our first concern, is to work with the Cardwell system. I know its limitations, but I also know its advantages. Its great advantage is this, that it gives you in your First Line Army&#x2014;and I make all the distinction in the world between the First Line Army and the Second Line Army&#x2014;a large number of highly-trained Reservists, more highly trained than the Reservists of any country in the world, who mobilise with your Regulars and make efficient fighting battalions.<lb/>
Reference has been made to South Africa. I believe, notwithstanding what has been said, that we performed a wonderful feat there under the leadership of my noble friend. I ask what other nation in the world could have sent a quarter of a million men, and there were more, to fight at that distance over-seas? Has any
<col>852</col>
Power on the Continent an organisation adapted for that purpose? Not one. With their land frontiers they develop all their strength in the organisation of enormous citizen armies, highly-trained First Line troops for short campaigns but not trained for over-seas, as they only can be organised if you proceed on the basis of a voluntary system. My noble friend said that the Regular Army has been reduced in numbers and that it was no better than it was before, except, perhaps, in training. But I think the noble and gallant Field-Marshal has overlooked the whole effect of modern mobilisation arrangements based on the new organisation. What has been done is this. Those engaged at the War Office have worked with patience and determination during the last five years to put every arm, every auxiliary requirement, and every element in the Expeditionary Force into its proper proportion, and I believe at this moment that but for horses we can mobilise the whole six Divisions. It is a mistake to think that we are in such difficulty for officers as is supposed. We have provided for that, although I know we should have to draw a very heavy draft on the depots and units at home. Still, we have taken these things into account, and we are improving the system still further. Horses, I admit, are a great difficulty, but I hope shortly to have proposals to lay before your Lordships which may materially at any rate improve our prospects as regards the mobilisation of horses.<lb/>
The Expeditionary Force is organised as our over-sea Army was never organised before, and the result is that. with fewer men&#x2014;and I admit I have reduced&#x2014;you can mobilise a large force and much more swiftly. I do not mean that it would not have been an advantage to have had these nine battalions if you could have added to them the other things that were requisite, but I had to choose between having an Army imperfect in its organisation, and an Army smaller in numbers but perfect, so that it was capable of more ready mobilisation; and, speaking for myself, I think that the quality compensates for the loss there has been in quantity. After all, my Lords, what were the reductions? They consisted of nine battalions, one of them being a very fine battalion of Guards. As to the other eight battalions, one was a battalion of Infantry created during the war and very short in numbers, and for
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0452"/>
<col>853</col>
the rest they consisted of Chinese troops, Colonial coloured troops, miscellaneous Garrison Artillery, and other troops. The main reduction was the nine battalions of which I have spoken, and under other arms increases were made. That being so, I cannot accept the proposition of my noble friend that the Expeditionary Army is in a bad condition to-day. I believe it is in a very good condition. Bear in mind that it is purely for second line defence that the Territorial Army is wanted. The existence of the Territorial Force is justified for that purpose. I believe that the Special Reserve is a better force than the Militia. Its numbers are less, but it supplies what, the General Staff has worked out as the requisites for finding drafts and providing for the wastage of war during the early period of a war. Therefore I cannot accept the foundation on which my noble friend has based his case.<lb/>
Let me hasten to say that I have always agreed with the value of physical training. I have always thought that the elements of discipline which military training gives, and the organisation which it brings, are good, and I would gladly join hands with him in any proposition to improve what I believe to be a shortcoming in our national education. I am speaking for myself in this. I have always held that the years from the age of fourteen to seventeen under our system in the education of boys shows a great gap in intellectual training. That is the period during which we manufacture hooligans instead of that finer type to be seen in our Boys Brigades and Boy Scouts; and if the proposition of my noble friend were to extend new functions to the Education Department in this respect I should, speaking for myself individually, cordially welcome the proposal. But I cannot think that to begin by calling upon the War Office to deal with boys of eighteen is a good thing from the point of view of our Regular Army system. My first purpose has been to show your Lordships what I submit you are invited to accept under the cover of this Motion, and my second purpose has been to show that our existing system is not the outcome of slackness or of a narrow conservatism, but the inevitable result of our strategical position geographically and historically, and I believe it to be the only system that suits us, and the only one that is really possible for us, island Empire as we are. Let us, therefore, beware lest
<col>854</col>
impulsively, in the desire to better our position, without considering where we are going we take a step which inflicts upon our military organisation a lasting injury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01743"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount, in a moving passage in the earlier part of his speech, drew a picture of himself sitting at the feet of the military experts of the War Office imbibing from them military wisdom. Some of us were under the impression that the process of inspiration had been rather of an opposite kind, and that in some cases at any rate it was rather the Secretary of State who had inspired the military expert than the military expert who had instructed the Secretary of State. But, be that as it may, there is evidently one generally accepted doctrine of strategy, which, whether he has derived it from his advisers at the War Office or from some other quarter, the noble Viscount has thoroughly laid to heart&#x2014;that is the principle that the best defensive is a bold offensive. He is called upon to-night to answer a formidable charge brought against the efficiency of the military forces of the Crown to discharge the various duties involved in the protection of this country and Empire. It is a difficult task that he has to perform in proving that efficiency. How has he discharged it? He has discharged it by devoting far the, greater and the more energetic portion of his speech, not to any proof of the adequacy of our existing arrangements, but to a spirited attack upon a particular chapter in a particular book recently published which advocates a different military system from our own. I do not propose to follow the noble Viscount in the detailed exposition with which his speech concluded of the actual existing perfection of our military forces, or at least of the Regular Army Other speakers will come after me who are far more competent than I am to deal with the details of that question. What I wish simply to dwell upon are certain general considerations of policy and strategy which lead us to question the adequacy of our military system as a whole.<lb/>
I cannot too strongly emphasise the fact that this Motion is not in any sense an attack upon the administration of the noble Viscount personally. We recognise his zeal, his ability, and the many improvements in detail which he has introduced, and we are impressed&#x2014;at least, speaking;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0453"/>
<col>855</col>
for myself, I am always greatly impressed&#x2014;by the minute command, admirable in a layman, which he possesses of a subject so difficult, so complicated, and requiring as a rule so much expert knowledge to handle. My Lords, this is not a personal question and it is not a Party question. In my humble opinion no Party and no Government in this country is in a position to throw stones at any other with regard to our military policy. From my point of view the problem has remained unsolved because it has never been courageously grappled with. The noble Viscount may be making bricks without straw as deftly, more deftly, perhaps, than any of his predecessors. But that does not alter the fact that as it seems to some of us, and for reasons which I will briefly try to explain, it is not possible for him under the conditions which he has laid down for himself, or perhaps it would be fairer to him to say under the conditions which he regards as inherent in. the circumstances of the case, to organise our military forces in such a manner as to deal effectively, not with all imaginable dangers, not with the logically possible (because I fully agree with the noble Viscount that we are not called upon to prepare against every danger which is logically possible), but with reasonably probable and I might almost say imminent contingencies.<lb/>
I always feel a certain hesitation when I venture to address your Lordships on questions of this nature, speaking as a layman to a House which contains so many men of great military authority and military experience. But I am emboldened in this case by some words which were used by the noble Viscount himself in his preface to that much discussed book of Sir Ian Hamilton's on "Compulsory Service." The noble Viscount there wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"The problem of our strategy is a problem which our history as a nation shows to have been one not for soldiers alone. It is too large and too far-reaching to be so confined."</quote>
I agree, and I agree also with the noble Viscount, as I believe we all do, that the command of the sea is "the essential foundation of our strategy." Where I perhaps differ from him is in my belief that a certain very considerable measure of military strength&#x2014;not such a degree of military strength certainly as is possessed by
<col>856</col>
the great Continental Powers, but a far greater degree than we either possess or aspire to under our present system&#x2014;is requisite in order to ensure that command of the sea. The noble Viscount himself is far from disregarding the necessity for a highly-trained military force. I will use his own words&#x2014;
<quote>"A long range Army capable of rapidly assuming the offensive and striking a blow wherever it would be most effective."</quote>
But does he seriously maintain that the Expeditionary Force is large enough, or could be put into the field rapidly enough, or could be maintained at its original strength long enough, to exercise any considerable effect upon a great Continental war? I do not refer to such an absurdity as the idea of its striking an effective blow against a Continental Power, if we were engaged with that Power single-handed. The point is that we are not, I believe, strong enough, to give effective assistance to an ally or allies on the Continent of Europe; and that, my Lords, goes to the root of this very important question of the command of the sea.<lb/>
The matter is so important that I venture, at the risk of being thought to repeat myself, to say once more to your Lordships, that we are too apt to think that we can maintain the command of the sea simply by willing it, by building more and more ships, and by out-building any possible rival or combination of rivals. We may possibly out-build a single Power, or perhaps two Powers. But, after all, there is a limit to our resources in this respect. We can build against one Power, or perhaps against two Powers, but we cannot build against the Continent of Europe; and if the balance of power on the Continent, which it has been our policy for centuries to try and uphold as bearing vitally upon this question of the command of the sea, were to be finally upset, I say it would be impossible for us to build against the combination of navies which might in that case be brought against us. That is the vital connection which seems to me to exist between, I do not say an army of Continental size, but an Army which can make itself felt and be of effective assistance to allies in a Continental struggle&#x2014;that is the vital connection between the maintenance of such an Army and the command of the sea. In order to help to
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0454"/>
<col>857</col>
maintain the balance of power in Europe we need to-day, precisely as we have always needed in the past, such a degree of military strength as will prevent our becoming a negligible quantity on land. And when we are warned, as we constantly are, that in urging the necessity of an increase of our present military strength we run the risk of impairing what is very much more important, our supremacy at sea, I am hound to say that I ask myself, though it may be a heresy, whether we have not now got to a point at which, even in the interest of the command of the sea, an increase in our military strength is not the most pressing strategical necessity.<lb/>
I pass from that to consider the second of what appear to me to be the three vital points with which, on the broad question of strategy, we have to deal. I refer to the position as regards the defence of our oversea Possessions. It may be said that, though the Expeditionary Force, owing to its small numbers, could not exercise any important influence upon a Continental struggle, yet that is not its principal business&#x2014;that its principal duty is the defence of our oversea Possessions, and especially of India. I do not deny that this certainly is one of its principal duties. But then I ask myself&#x2014;leaving the question of participation in a Continental war entirely out of sight&#x2014;whether, even for the discharge of this duty, of efficiently defending our oversea Possessions, we are at present adequately equipped. Why should any one consider that we are We were confronted a little more than twelve years ago with a serious danger&#x2014;the first serious danger which had threatened any part of our overseas Empire for perhaps thirty years. And although we successfully overcame that danger, and although it may be true, as the noble Viscount says, that no other Power could have similarly overcome it, surely we cannot contemplate with equanimity the expenditure of 200 millions of money and 20,000 or more lives whenever a danger no greater than that arising from the opposition of two small Republics, whose total force did not exceed 90,000 men, confronts the British Empire on any of its frontiers. However much we may have admired the skill of our Generals, the gallantry of our soldiers, or the toughness of the country which carried us through, in spite of inadequate prepara-
<col>858</col>
tion, there was at the time very little satisfaction felt at the display which we then made of military preparedness or unpreparedness.<lb/>
A very strong Royal Commission laid it down that our military system, and especially the Expeditionary Force for the defence of our oversea Possessions, suffered from one radical defect. That defect has been dwelt upon by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. It was the lack of power of expansion. But what has happened in tile last ten years to increase that power of expansion to any material degree? You have had the Special Reserve substituted for the Militia; the Volunteers have been re-christened the Territorial Army, and no doubt their organisation has -been considerably improved. But what is there in all this to fill the enormous, yawning gap in our military preparations which our experience in the Boer War revealed? Substantially the position as regards our power of expansion is unaltered to-day. As long as that remains the case, no criticism of others will exempt the Government of the day from the duty which rests upon every Government, though none has yet tackled it, of remedying that which experience has proved, and which the Royal Commission just referred to has laid down, to be the radical defect of our military system&#x2014;the want of the power of expansion as affecting the Expeditionary Force required for the defence of our oversea Possessions.<lb/>
Lastly, let me ask this: If our military system as it exists to-day leaves us a negligible quantity on land in any struggle for the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe, upon which our supremacy at sea depends; if from lack of the power of expansion it is unsatisfactory even from the point of view of the defence of our oversea Possessions, how do we stand with regard to the defence of these islands? We are told&#x2014;the noble Viscount has insisted on it to-night, as he has often insisted on it before&#x2014;that the virtual defence of these islands rests with the Navy. Yes, but what does that involve '? Even the most optimistic view of the power of the Navy to provide absolute defence for these islands rests or the assumption that the Navy can always be concentrated upon that particular duty, and consequently that no considerable portion of our naval
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0455"/>
<col>859</col>
force has been detached from the duty of defending our shores. Unless the main body of the Fleet is devoted to the defence of these islands, that security. upon which we rely does not exist; and if the main body of the Fleet is always to be devoted to this purpose, then it is plain that it cannot do what it has done in the past, and what it might be essential it should be able to do in the future&#x2014;that is to say, detach a considerable force for the protection of some distant part of our Empire. It is not only the Expeditionary Force which may be required for the defence of our oversea Possessions. The Navy may have to play a considerable part in that defence.<lb/>
We talk about the command of the sea, but the most that we have at the present moment is the command of the narrow seas. One of the most regrettable changes in the strategic position in recent times is the fact that we no longer exercise that command of the sea, in distant oceans, which we formerly did. And. my Lords, is it not to a large extent due to our military weakness at home, to our anxiety about an inadequately-protected base, that that contraction of our naval power&#x2014;the concentration of all the energies of the Navy upon the defence of these islands, to the detriment of its efficacy for the defence of the Empire&#x2014;is largely due? it is in order that the Navy may give us that absolute protection, which alone would enable even the noble Viscount to rest satisfied with our present forces for home defence, that it is obliged to relax its former grip of other seas than those which immediately surround these islands. That to my mind, is the strongest condemnation of our military system as it at present exists&#x2014;that neither the Expeditionary Force nor the Navy can be set free from the primary duty of the defence of these islands. It is a strange thing that the advocates of this essentially and purely defensive policy should reproach us, who wish to train the people of this country so that they may set free their regular Army and Navy for service in any portion of the world, with adopting a purely defensive attitude, and failing to realise the supreme importance for successful warfare of a policy of offence.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has assumed that in the case of a bolt from the blue the Expeditionary Force would still be in this country. But that is just what I think is the least likely: I have said that I fully agree as to
<col>860</col>
the necessity of not exaggerating the dangers to which we are exposed, and I entirely deprecate the policy of imagining a conjunction of all possible disasters. But there is one conjunction of dangers which, so far from being impossible or unlikely, is so very probable that as reasonable men we cannot exclude it from our calculations; and that is that the bolt from the blue&#x2014;or, not to put it quite so strongly, let us say a serious European danger&#x2014;should arise at the time and perhaps in consequence of our being involved in trouble over the defence of some of our distant Possessions. It seems to me that, if there is any Power which envies our Possessions or our position in the world, it is precisely at the moment when we were involved in serious difficulties in India or Egypt that we should be likely to have that Power on our backs. That would be the moment at which the Expeditionary Force would be required elsewhere. Should we in these circumstances have the courage to send it, indeed, should we be justified in sending it? And the same applies to the despatch of such a naval force as might be necessary for the defence of our oversea Possessions.<lb/>
It is very disagreeable to have to put hypotheses, in which you name or point to particular Powers. I am very reluctant to do it, but we are obliged sometimes, without offence to any nation, to put cases of this kind. We are at present discharged from the duty of policing the Eastern seas with our Fleet because of our alliance with Japan. But what of a position in which that alliance no longer existed, or a position in which our friendship had been converted into enmity, and we were called upon to protect or to assist in protecting, say, the North of Australia from invasion by a Power which had both considerable naval and military strength? Surely that is not such a wildly improbable contingency, nor is it in the least improbable that, if such a difficulty arose, it would arise concurrently with troubles in which we might be involved nearer home. And then we should be confronted with this dilemma&#x2014;either we must retain the Expeditionary Force and the Navy here for the protection of these islands, in which case we should lose one portion of our Empire, or we should strike a bold blow for the defence of the threatened portion of the Empire, in which case we should no longer enjoy that absolute protection, or anything like that absolute protection,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0456"/>
<col>861</col>
against the invasion of these islands upon which the noble Viscount relies.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I ask is it really an unreasonable demand that we should have such a defensive force in this country, as would enable us, without fear, to part with the whole of our Expeditionary Force and its Reserves if it were necessary to do so at some critical moment in the defence of our oversea Empire? I maintain that that is not an unreasonable demand, and that it would not place a strain upon either our manhood or our resources greater than we can and ought to bear. I am not suggesting that we should attempt to rival the great Continental Powers in the extent of their military preparations. I am not ignoring the immense advantages which we enjoy in consequence of our island position, but I do say that in relying absolutely for the defence of these islands upon the Navy we are abusing the privileges of that island position. We are presuming too far upon it. The least we have a right to ask&#x2014;and I believe that if it were firmly asked by leading Statesmen it would be obtained front the people of this country&#x2014;is that they should undergo, for the protection of their liberties and of all those great blessings which they enjoy above all other nations, such a degree of military training as would enable the manhood of this country as civilian soldiers to protect our shores and set both the Expeditionary Force and the Navy absolutely free, if need be, for the defence of the Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01744"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the services which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal has rendered to this country are so considerable, and the authority with which he speaks upon military matters is so universally acknowledged in this House, that it is with the greatest deference that I venture to stand here and differ from the views which he has put forward to-night. But, after all, although it is the duty of experts to advise, the civilian mind must in the last resort judge as between experts, and we can none of us shirk the responsibility of forming our own opinion upon the views put forward by experts, even though they may be so acknowledged as those of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. My Lords, we are here to-night to resist a concerted, though long delayed, attack upon the efficiency and the sufficiency of our
<col>862</col>
military preparations. But what struck me as curious this evening is that neither the proposer of this Resolution nor the noble Viscount who has just spoken in support of it, although they have in general terms arraigned the military preparations of the Crown, put forward in any shape whatever anything like a detailed or even a general outline of the scheme which they would put in the place of our present arrangements. For that we are left to whatever guidance we can obtain from t he book, part of which has been written by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, entitled "Fallacies and Facts," although I understand he does not wholly identify himself with the conclusions and some of the details of the second part of that book, in which the proposed alternative which might be set up in place of our present arrangement is gone into in some detail.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, lea me re-state what our position on this side of the House is. We consider that the military problem is intimately connected with the naval problem, and we believe that as long as we have supremacy at sea we have a very different problem before us from that which confronts ordinary Continental nations, and, from the military point of view, we claim that our system secures the maintenance of our foreign garrisons in India and other Colonial Possessions. It provides its with an Expeditionary Force quire equal to the task of dealing with those small wars which are incidental to the possession of a great Empire; and, further, in the Territorial Army we have a force which in itself, and also with the assistance of that part of the Regular Army which does not form part of the Expeditionary Force, is sufficient to compel an invading army to come in such numbers as would not easily escape detection by our Navy. That is our position. But I notice that the criticisms which are made against this position are always on the ground of the possibility of the invasion of this country, or, which is another part of it, of the tethering to the shores of this country of battleships which it is said, and said with truth, ought to have complete freedom of range. Just observe what the invasionists must assume to make -heir position tenable. They must assume five things to be coexistent. In the first place, this country must be at war with two Powers, and we must be without allies. Then those two Powers must be either America and Germany, or Russia and Germany, because
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0457"/>
<col>863</col>
it is conceded that these are the parts of our Empire where the greatest frontier line exists, and where, consequently, the greatest military effort will be needed. I refer to Afghanistan, against Russian invasion of India, or on the frontier between Canada and the United States. Consequently we should have to he at war with Russia owing to a threatened invasion of India by Russia, or else we should have to be at war with the United States in consequence of a threatened invasion of Canada, and at that moment, quite unexpectedly, Germany is to make a descent upon our shores.<lb/>
Another assumption of the invasionists is that the whole of our Expeditionary Force is absent at the time of the descent on our shores. They also assume the partial or temporary loss of our command of the sea, owing either to the defeat of our Navy or to its absence. They further must assume that this bolt from the blue comes in the early stages of the war, because admittedly, after a period of six months at any rate, the Territorials are very much improved in fighting value. Consequently the invasion, if it is to come at all, must come very early in the campaign. Next, they assume that there is to be a completely successful landing of the whole of the invading army, not one transport is to go astray, not one mishap to overtake the invaders, and, further, the immediate destruction is to follow of the whole of the Territorial Force in this country, and also of those 100,000 Regulars, or more, who form part of the Regular Army but do not form part of the First Line of the Expeditionary Force. In considering the possibility of invasion we have been criticised because it has been said&#x2014;the noble and gallant Field-Marshal said it also&#x2014;that the enemy are going to be so considerate as to come where we want and when we want them to, and to give us due notice of their coining. I do not admit that at all. But if we make such an assumption then these five other assumptions that I have alluded to, under which alone invasion is possible, are, I submit, very much greater ones.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01745"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>:May I ask the noble Lord who has made those five assumptions? It would be interesting to know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01746"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will find that it is only on the acceptance of those assumptions that the theory of invasion becomes at all tenable.
<col>864</col>
Unless the Expeditionary Force is absent we shall not only have the Territorials and the Regulars, but we shall have the whole of the Expeditionary Force amounting to about 170,000 men. Does the noble Lord consider that the flower of the British Army is not capable of meeting 70,000 invaders? Of course, it is. He must assume the absence of the Expeditionary Force, otherwise the whole of his argument tumbles to the ground; and if he goes through the assumptions I have alluded to, he will find that every one of those contingencies will have to be assumed before the invasionist theory has any sort of reality at all or anything in it to frighten anybody.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01748"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: You have to assume those five things. They are assumed by all authorities. They may not be assumed by the noble Lord, Lord Lovat, but they are assumed by all authorities. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal has referred to them in the book he has issued to the public, and the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, in a speech in this House I think about two years ago, admitted that in order to make the possibility of invasion anything like a real menace you must assume that we should be taken unprepared, that the whole of our Expeditionary Army would be absent, and that our Fleet would be either lured away to some distant place or had suffered some temporary defeat. The Leader of the Opposition made that admission himself, and it was in consequence of that admission that he scouted the idea of the imminence of an invasion of these shores. When I consider all the assumptions that are necessary to the argument for invasion, I am led to the belief that, although it is on that ground that noble Lords opposite make an appeal to the public, their real object is very different from that which they disclose, and in that respect I think I am borne out by the admissions of the noble. Viscount, Lord Milner.<lb/>
The noble Viscount admitted that it was not so much a question of home defence as a question of having to participate in some great war on the Continent, or the loss of the command of the sea, which caused him anxiety. The real object of these criticisms is to produce an Army
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0458"/>
<col>865</col>
which is capable either of intervening with effect on the Continent of Europe, or that the authors of these proposals fear in their minds that we may at some time in the future lose that command of the sea which we at present enjoy. With regard to that I have this to say, that neither of those two propositions appears to me to be imminent. For the time at any rate we have the command of the sea, and should we lose that command it might certainly be necessary for us to reconsider our position and see whether that loss, partial or complete, could be made up for by greater military preparations. It might then, indeed, be necessary; but so long as we do hold command of the sea I really do not think it is necessary for us to consider what our position might become if our command of the sea was lost or impaired.<lb/>
With regard to the question of what part we are able to play in Europe in carrying out what is said to be our traditional policy of holding the balance of power in Europe, in the first place I have to say that there, again, I do not see that any great disturbance of the balance of power in Europe is imminent. There is no sign that we are going to enter upon a new Napoleonic age which would necessitate our making great sacrifices, as we did during his time, to preserve the balance of power and prevent the absorption and destruction of the smaller European States. No doubt if such a contingency arose we might have to reconsider our military position, as we did then, but I think it is a great mistake to assume that we are at the present time debarred from taking any part in European affairs and from playing any important part in the maintenance of the balance of power. Does the noble and gallant Field-Marshal mean to say that our Expeditionary Force would be quite valueless for that purpose?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01752"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Well, my Lords, if that is the proposition, I submit with great deference that the six Divisions that we are able to send abroad would not be such a negligible quantity as the noble Earl seems to think. In the first place, our Array, small though it might be, would, man for man, be a very much better force that any of the conscript levies of the Continent. Surely the noble and gallant Field-Marshal does not mean to tell your Lordships' House that British soldiers who have served on an average seven years with the Colours, stiffened as they will be by some of the Reserve who have passed through the ranks, are not better, man for man, than any of the conscript levies of Europe? I should be very much surprised if the noble Earl were to rise in his place and tell your Lordships that. But, whatever his estimate may be of the value of British troops man for man, surely it is going a long way to say that this country is incapable of playing any important part in maintaining the balance of European power which is considered necessary for our interests when it possesses such a military force as we possess and such a preponderance of naval power as is ours to-day.<lb/>
Coming back to the only source of definite proposals on this subject&#x2014;the book issued under the authority of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal&#x2014;I see that the writer of the second part of that book clearly has in mind the necessity of our intervening in European affairs. What he proposes is not only a long service Army by which the Empire may be garrisoned, with a very small striking force behind it, but also a short service Army capable of playing an important part in European affairs. My noble friend the Secretary of State for War has drawn your Lordships' attention to the fact that this short service Army would be not nearly so good, man for man, as our present striking force. But observe what the proposal involves. The proposal of the writer of the second part of this book involves this, that he admits that we should have to get 70,000 recruits a year for the long service Army and for the short service Army, and he admits that 70,000 recruits can only be obtained by the indirect pressure of compulsion for home defence. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"Only indirect pressure of compulsion for home defence would make this possible."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0459"/>
<col>867</col>
It is difficult for me to understand quite how that compulsion would come into play. Put yourselves in the position of an individual who has got to submit to a very short period of training in the national Militia, and who, to escape that, volunteers to enter the short service Army which involves a period of one or two years service. Of course it may be that the longer military service may appear to a man who is unwilling to serve to be less onerous than a shorter military service; but personally I think we must admit that to trust to that, and to that alone, to fill up the ranks of the short service and the long service Armies is to indulge in a very great gamble.<lb/>
I do not suppose anybody would deny that there is a great advantage from au Imperial point of view in possessing a long service professional Army. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal, I think, would himself admit that any proposals which weakened or destroyed that arm of our service would be disastrous. The question then arises in its simplest form whether, in view of the fact that the Territorial Forces are not up to their strength, and according to noble Lords opposite not even then sufficiently numerous, it is possible for a voluntary service to co-exist with a compulsory service? The noble and gallant Field-Marshal alluded to an observation which I made in this House last year to the effect that I did not believe that the British people would accept a compulsory system except as the result of a disaster such as I indicate. Does the noble and gallant Field-Marshal deny that fact? Does he think that the people of this country would accept a compulsory system unless it was brought home to them and they realised it as the result of some disaster?</membercontribution></p>

I am glad to have an opportunity of putting my position before him, because I do not think he understood it. But may I first conclude what I was saying. Does the noble Lord think that the country is prepared at the present moment to adopt a national system of compulsory service?
<col>868</col>
If he does not think so, his duty is to go and educate and try and convert the country to his way of thinking, instead of admonishing Ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01755"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: That is exactly what we are doing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01756"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord can persuade the country as to the necessity of compulsory service he will then be in a very different position from that in which he is at the present moment. I do not think that at present the country is prepared for such a change, and I doubt myself whether anything short of a disaster would make them attempt it. Your Lordships will remember, to take the ease of France that it was only the disaster of 1870 that made them adopt compulsory service. Before that they had a different system. The real question is whether it is possible to combine our voluntary service Army, effective as it is for oversea purposes and campaigns of considerable duration, with a compulsory system for home service? Of course, it is not very easy to say; but I observe that writers on this subject rely to a considerable extent upon the fact that the three-year service men, for which system the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, is responsible, signed on for the longer engagement in the proportion of 40 per cent. I do not myself think that that is any guide as to what might happen under the system we are now considering, because, in the first place, those 40 per cent. were only got, many of them, as the result of very considerable bonus inducements, and, in the second place, they belonged to a class of men who had volunteered for military service; they were not the class of men with whom we are concerned when we are considering how far the national conscript Militia would be available for voluntary service. They were men who intended to take up a military career from the start, and the only question in their minds was whether they would serve for three years or for a longer period.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01757"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord forgive me? He has left out one great inducement to those men not to extend. If they did not extend they had to look forward to nine years in the Reserve at fid a day for doing nothing unless the Reserve happened to be called out. That would not be the case under Lord Roberts's measure.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0460"/>
<col>869</col>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01758"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: In any case, you cannot take the 40 per cent. as at all representative of the percentage that might be expected to volunteer in the national Militia for the short or long service Army. Perhaps it has no bearing on the subject at all, but, anyhow, it is no indication whatever as to the percentage that would volunteer under the system proposed by the National Service League, because they are a different class of men altogether. Another thing upon which the promoters of this scheme rely is that 40,000 Special Reservists enter the Army every year. Neither is this a fact which gives us very much enlightenment on the subject, because nobody knows better than the noble Viscount himself that the Special Reserve, or Militia as it was in those days, is one of the recognised doors by which the Army is entered. Some 80 per cent. of those 40,000 men, I venture to say, were men who failed to get into the Army direct, and who were told by the recruiting sergeants that if they would go and do six months in the Militia they would then pass the recruiting test. The noble Viscount knows that perfectly well, and, if that be so, then the fact that 40,000 Special Reservists entered the Army last year does not prove at all how many might be expected to enter the Army under the new circumstances. I feel that, whatever view we may take as to the desirability of substituting a compulsory national Militia for the Territorial Force, we do run a very grave risk that we may come to grief over our recruiting difficulties. If the recruits are not forthcoming, where are we indeed? We shall be in a much more difficult position than we are at the present time.<lb/>
Then there is another point. If you develop a national Militia, it will no doubt be an expensive thing. What it will cost is difficult to say. It has been estimated to cost &#x00A3;4,000,000 more than the present Estimates; it has also been estimated to cost &#x00A3;9,000,000 more than the present Estimates; in any case the excess in cost will be considerable, and I venture to say that to some extent that additional cost will be met at the expense of the Regular Army. You will find that ultimately the financial problem will tell against the Regular Army. Once the nation has established a national Militia system, especially if on the compulsory basis, there will be a tendency to starve the Regular Army. That certainly is what has
<col>870</col>
happened in France. Ever since the French reversed their policy and substituted compulsory military service for the conscript service, they have found greater difficulties in maintaining either the numbers or the standard, or, indeed, the popularity of their foreign legions. Previous to 1870 the French possessed an Army which was capable of going anywhere and of playing an Imperial part. No doubt that Army was unsuitable for home defence. The German critics stated at the time that it was the French Imperial policy which brought about her downfall in 1870; and, much as she has improved her Army in other respects, she cannot be said to have improved her Army as an instrument for Imperial purposes.<lb/>
It seems to me that on the whole the noble and gallant Field-Marshal and those who have spoken with him have not gone very far to make out a case for the proposals with which their names are associated. They have not given us, in this House at any rate, anything like a complete or detailed scheme of what they propose to set up in the place of our present military arrangements. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal contented himself with remarking that the fundamental defect of our Army was the voluntary training. That is a general assertion. The noble Viscount. Lord Milner, was still vaguer. He said that the people should have such a degree of military training as would enable them to protect our shores. I venture to suggest to those two noble Lords that it is one thing to make vague criticisms upon our military organisations and quite another to translate those criticisms into practice. If they were, as they may be, responsible for the protection of these shores and for the maintenance of our garrisons in India and in the Colonies, and were obliged to have regard to the possibility of having to meet those smaller wars with which our Imperial expansion is inevitably connected, I wonder whether they would be so ready to scrap the present system and substitute for it the rather vague proposals which have hardly been worked out and which are the property and the policy of the National Service League? At any rate they have not said enough to convince me, and I do not think to convince anybody sitting on this side of the House, of the wisdom or the necessity of their policy; and I only hope when noble Lords opposite come, as they will
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0461"/>
<col>871</col>
do no doubt in time, to occupy the position of responsibility from which they are at present divorced, they will give this question more definite and more earnest consideration before they take the step they contemplate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01759"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to speak on the Motion which has been so forcibly and at the same time so eloquently moved by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, I trust the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War will not consider that I wish to approach this question in any political or Party spirit&#x2014;nothing is further from my thoughts&#x2014;or with any desire to disparage what we all recognise as his honest endeavour to solve the problem of Imperial and national defence on economic lines. I believe that is the wish of every Member of your Lordships' House, although there are some of us who do not find ourselves in agreement with the noble Viscount as to the best way of solving the problem of how to increase our military efficiency and at the same time decrease the expenditure thereon. Nevertheless, I am sure we all recognise the many difficulties that the noble Viscount has had to contend with and the strenuous work he has put into the solving of the problem, and I venture to think that he will be the first to acknowledge that without the loyal support of so many members of your Lordships' House, on both sides, his Territorial scheme would not have made the headway it undoubtedly has attained. I am sure every one of us will agree that to those who have come forward in that true patriotic spirit of devotion and self-sacrifice and joined that Force all honour is due, more especially when we recognise that the services of those recruits who have joined the Territorial Army are purely voluntary in the true sense of the word. I make use of the phrase "voluntary in the true sense of the word" because we are always hearing that our Army is recruited on a voluntary basis. I think that any one who has been in the Army for any length of time must know that the majority of recruits are not recruited voluntarily in the true sense of the word, but simply owing to stress of unfortunate circumstances.<lb/>
The noble and gallant Earl has often reminded us in this House that not only is a strong and invincible Navy requisite for the defence of this vast Empire, but that a strong military force is also absolutely
<col>872</col>
essential for the safeguarding of its interests all over the world. I venture to think that past history has shown us the truth of that&#x2014;namely, that Fleets alone have never brought any war to a satisfactory conclusion, but that it always has to be fought to a final decision on land, whether the assailants be island States or not. We had good experience of Russo-Japanese War. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal has told to-night that in his opinion our forces are inadequate&#x2014;at any rate our forces are forces&#x2014;and therefore he considers that our country is in danger. Such a statement coming from one who must be regarded as the greatest military expert in this House would appear some justification. My Lords, I regret to think that it can be justified, and for this reason. We know very well that there is all over the Continent at the present time a widespread feeling of dislike against this country. This feeling has not emanted from one cause, but from many, and the most powerful of all is envy of this great country and its prosperity, which I contend constitutes a real and growing danger.<lb/>
I think the statement can be justified for yet another reason. We know only too well that all foreign Powers have determined to prepare for war on sound and scientific lines, whilst we, on the other hand, have failed to do so by simply declining or neglecting to base our military organization on any definite or accepted principle. My reason for saying that is that no one at the present time can even pretend to say for what functions the different branches of His Majesty's military forces are intended, or on what basis the numbers of those different forces are set down, and no explanation as a rule is forthcoming as to why a particular force is proposed to be increased or decreased. I will endeavour to prove my statements with regard to that. In doing so I would like to refer to a force with which I have been connected for some years, and which I have had the honour now of commanding for over thirteen years as the old constitutional force, the Militia, was a few years age transformed into a new force new force now known as the Special Reserve, and twenty-seven of its battalions were changed and called Extra Reserve battalions. Every one of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0462"/>
<col>873</col>
those battalions was reduced in establishment both in officers and men for some unknown reason, although they had more important functions to perform, and we were then told that the functions of the rank and file of the Special Reserve were to make good the wastage of war among the Regular battalions, whilst the officers of these Special Reserve battalions were told that their duty was to ensure that all units, services and departments were complete in officers on mobilisation. The rank and file of the extra reserve battalions were told that they were to work by units and to be available to reinforce oversea garrisons in time of war, or to reinforce the Army in the field. Owing to the undoubted shortage both of officers and men, more especially among the junior ranks in that force&#x2014;and when we know that the rank and file of the Special Reserve comprise merely a few Militiamen whose time in 1914 will expire there remain in the Force only a few immature lads who have failed for some weakness or another to pass on into the Regular Army&#x2014;for these reasons I have not the least hesitation in saying, and I say it with regret, that the Special Reserve would be unable to perform on mobilisation the functions for which it has been designed, and I venture to think that my noble friend Lord Salisbury, who also, like myself, has commanded a Special Reserve battalion for many years ill conjunction with the Militia, will endorse that assertion.<lb/>
The recent military debates in another place clearly illustrated in my opinion the lack of knowledge of military matters possessed by the majority of the Members of the other House, because on reading through the Debates it will be noticed that very little mention was made of the Special Reserve, which any one with any military experience will be aware is in a most unsatisfactory state at the present time. I am aware, however, that there are certain Members in the other House, I hope not many, who advocate peace at any price, and who suggest that because we have alliances and <i>ententes</i> with other countries our naval and military expenditure should be greatly reduced. To those individuals I would venture to suggest that an alliance is only made when sonic mutual gain is to accrue thereby, and that an agreement of that kind should be regarded as a question not of sentiment
<col>874</col>
but of business. If that is so, surely it is safer to act as we have done in the past and rely upon our own right arm&#x2014;that is, upon our naval and military resources; for, depend upon it, if a great and wealthy nation like our own is not prepared to take the field at short notice it must inevitably court disaster. There can be little doubt but that that pernicious system, which I regret to think has been so often practised in this country, of trying to economise by cutting down our military forces, has cost this country millions, whilst it only leads to fabulous expenditure when war threatens. Experience in the past should have taught us this lesson, that the essence of all military efficiency can only be obtained by judicious expenditure, and that money well spent on armaments is the best insurance against war that any country can obtain.<lb/>
My Lords, the complaints which we are so constantly hearing in another place with regard to armaments should, in my opinion, be regarded as puerile and waste of time, for there can be little doubt that other countries are not going to reduce their armaments, and I believe that the race of armaments is likely to continue until we make up our minds to have an unquestionably supreme Navy and a National Army. The shortage of officers and men, not only in the Regular Army but in every other branch of our forces, emphasises the fact&#x2014;I think proves it&#x2014;that our voluntary system is beginning to break down, and that some other scheme will have to be adopted such as that advocated by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal of universal military training or service. If, as has been asserted, this country is not likely to entertain that idea, then, my Lords, we have but one alternative, and that is to spend far more money on our military forces than has been the case hitherto, more especially with regard to increased pay of officers, if those forces are to be equal in discipline, training, and numbers to the forces of those who may be regarded as our possible enemies. Our Colonies have begun to realise that their security is dependent on some form of universal military training, and is it an unreasonable question to ask why an Englishman, of all men in the world, should be exempt from performing the first duty of citizenship&#x2014;that is to say, to learn to defend his country. I fail to understand
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0463"/>
<col>875</col>
what are the objections. I know that some have been raised, and with your permission I will deal very shortly with a few of them.<lb/>
One favourite argument of the opponents of this proposal, who are always so fond of designating it as Conscription, which is an absolute misnomer, is that it will interfere with our trade and industries. In reply, one might reasonably ask has it ever interfered with the trade and industries of France, Germany, and Russia? Facts prove that the reverse is the case, and that the more perfect the military training the better is the trade. That is exemplified in the case of Germany, who themselves attribute their industrial efficiency to their good military system. Another objection so often raised is that military training would harden a man and brutalise him. If that is true, how is it that Germany is well known at the present time to be far ahead of any civilised nation in the world in the matter of education? Also if that is the case how is it that German musicians, scientists, and doctors are well known all over the world, all of whom have gone through some form of naval or military training? There is one more objection that I would like to refer to. I think it is the worst, because in my opinion it savours of unpatriotism. It is said that it would be disastrous to any political Party who introduced such a system as universal military training. I do not believe that that is so. I am one of those who contend that the British working classes are patriotic to the backbone&#x2014;that is to say, if they are taught patriotism&#x2014;but whether I am right or wrong on that point I contend that questions affecting the Army and Navy are so vital to our Empire that they should not be regarded as within the pale of Party politics. No matter what our convictions with regard to other political matters may be, we should always remember that upon a statesmanlike solution of naval and military matters must depend the security and well being of our country, and that a false step or any injudicious action may result in such disastrous consequences that I am sure I am voicing the opinion of every member of your Lordships' House when I say that it should be our endeavour to do our best to prevent the possibility of such consequences arising. For these reasons, my Lords, I shall have great pleasure in supporting the Motion
<col>876</col>
moved by the noble and gallant Fie id-Marshal.

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01760"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who addressed the House from the other side shortly before the adjournment for dinner laid down several assumptions with which I think many members of this House are inclined to disagree. I do not propose to follow him at length into those assumptions, but if think one or two of them are worthy of some consideration, if only between himself and the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War. He started by laying down the assumption that invasion was absolutely impossible. It. seems fairly obvious that if invasion is utterly impossible the home defence Army is not required at all, and that is a point which I hope he will clear up with the noble Viscount opposite. Then he went on to state that before invasion was possible every kind of thing must happen&#x2014;either a war with Russia or with the United States. I throw out the suggestion that it is possible that if we should have much unrest in India our Expeditionary Force would have to go there.<lb/>
A great point has been made throughout the country, and it was touched upon by the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, that Sir Arthur Wilson has furnished a Memorandum in which it is stated that invasion is practically impossible. I do not pretend to gauge how far such a qualification extends, but I venture to think that some qualification is necessary, and that for more than one reason. The noble Viscount went on to say that in all such questions affecting sea power it was obviously the naval experts who should be considered rather than the military experts. That is a statement with which every member is inclined to agree, but there is, perhaps, yet another expert who is to be considered, and that is the historian. I think if we examine history we will find that it has constantly been stated that invasion is practically if not altogether impossible, but it has not necessarily followed that invasion has not taken place. I would instance the Chief of the Russian Naval Staff referring to the question of the possibility of the Japanese landing troops in Manchuria before the war. He went so far as to state&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0464"/>
<col>877</col>
<quote>"So long as our fleet is not destroyed, the operations named are impossible."</quote>
As every member of your Lordships' House is aware, the Japanese did land troops in Manchuria, and they did so before the Russian Fleet was altogether destroyed. We have an instance even in our own history, in Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. That invasion was undertaken by a considerable force, and. we certainly would have claimed to have had the command of the Mediterranean at that time. That invasion did not take place under the eyes of an Admiral who might he called an. incompetent fool, because the Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy at that time was Lord Nelson himself. It is perfectly true that Napoleon was extremely fortunate in escaping observation by the British Fleet, but fate, or luck, or Providence, or whatever you may call it, is just as likely to arise in the wars of the future as in the wars of the past. I think that even the Admiralty themselves support the view that they cannot really defend the shores of the British Empire. If that were not the case, it is surely obvious that all that would be required at coaling stations such as Malta, Bermuda, or the Mauritius, would be a sufficient force to prevent, pilfering from the dockyards and the observations of foreign spies. As it is, there are 1,700 Regular troops in Malta, apart altogether from the Colonial Corps which exists there. If the invasion of Malta was quite hopeless, I think that a few gunners would be all that would be required. But I need not press that point, because if invasion were really considered impossible it is quite obvious that there would be no occasion for a Home Army.<lb/>
There are many members of your Lordships' House who are far better qualified than I am to discuss how great could be the strength of any force which might invade these islands. I do not, therefore, propose to go into that question at, all, but will take the War Office figure of 70,000 men. Now, suppose the Expeditionary Force of this country were away in India, or possibly elsewhere, there is virtually nothing left that is worth consideration except the Territorial Force of 270,000 men. Then supposing our Expeditionary Force had been away some time, and the greater part of the Special Reserve had been already called up to fill the ranks wasted by losses in battle and by sickness.
<col>878</col>
The Secretary of State for War rather ridiculed the idea that men after one year's training would be capable of meeting a Continental army. If that is the case, what can be said of troops that get ten drills per year, and. a fortnight's training? Because that is what the Territorial Force get. One year's training is not sufficient in the opinion of the Secretary of State for War. Therefore still less can fourteen days be sufficient for what is necessary.<lb/>
The noble Viscount went on to allude to a speech made the other day by Colonel Repington, in which it was stated that three battalions of the Territorial Force were now at this moment the equivalent of one Regular battalion. As the Territorial Force numbers 270,000 men, and the possible figure of the invading army is placed at 70,000, it would follow on the surface that we have at the present time a surplus of Territorial troops. But, as every one knows, these Territorial troops are not in one particular place, or near a particular position where an invading force would land. They are scattered throughout the whole of Great Britain. No one knows better than the Secretary of State for War and the noble Lord who was so recently Under-Secretary that these troops are scattered more or less in brigades, and it would take a considerable time before they could be brought together to meet the invading force. So far from the Territorial Force being in the proportion of more than three to one to the invading force, the probabilities are that the proportion would be exactly in the inverse <i>ratio</i>.<lb/>
Perhaps I might be allowed to give a personal analogy. Supposing I take four noble Lords opposite. I should not be allowed to pick noble Lords in any way, because the officers commanding the Territorial battalions have no means of picking their recruits. They must take the first that are offered. Supposing I took the first four noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite and suggested that they should be given ten lessons in boxing, and then put them into training for a fortnight, and at the end of that time put them into the ring and asked them to face the best professional boxer I could find. It is perhaps "logically possible" that the four noble Lords might be victorious, but I think it is far more "reasonably probable" that they would stiffer very considerable loss. Being a member of the Territorial Force and of a County Associa-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0465"/>
<col>879</col>
tion I venture to think that I cannot very well be accused of attacking this subject from an anti-Territorial point of view, but I do none the less contend that the Territorial Force is neither competent in numbers nor efficiency nor discipline for the work it might possibly be called upon to do.<lb/>
Let me take the question of numbers first. I have already pointed out that the Territorial Force is scattered throughout Great Britain, and that therefore at any given point there would be very much less than three battalions to one of any possible invading force. Sir Ian Hamilton has said that supposing the Territorial Force were defeated, such a defeat would have a most disastrous effect. It is perfectly obvious that if the Territorials were put in the position of having to meet an invading army with an inferior force, defeat would be not only probable but certain, because they would be deficient not only in numbers, but also in training and efficiency. Take the question of discipline. I dare say some of your Lordships who have been in camp with the Territorials or have seen them at man&#x0153;uvres, as I have constantly, will know that when the bugle for "lights out" is sounded, it is by no means a signal for silence in the camp, although, as we know, silence is one of the rules of all camps after "lights out." It is impossible to enforce that rule of silence, and that is because there is no discipline to enforce it upon the troops. If there is no discipline in a small point, is there any reason why there should be discipline in a great point, particularly when that point is emphasised by the personal element which arises in so many cases?<lb/>
I do not wish to weary the House with minor points, but I desire to refer to a point as to military training. As many of your Lordships know, at any rate those who have shot in rapid competitions at Bisley, the physical exhaustion of keeping up rapid rifle fire is very considerable, and the only possible way to acquire that efficiency is by constant practice. I have pointed that out to a good many Territorial officers, and it is a fact with which they all agree. I have suggested that on field days they should train their troops by getting them to pick up targets in various directions, whether of advancing troops or particular objects, and getting them practised in constant and prolonged operations of rapid firing. Many of them have tried, but
<col>880</col>
nearly all have told me the same thing. They say that the troops will shoot for a certain time, and then they get bored with it and stop. Now, the military profession, like everything else, has a good deal of drudgery connected with it, and if you are only to give orders that are popular with the troops and not those that involve drudgery it is obvious that the training is going to be extremely faulty. Then on the question of training itself. Owing to the low trajectory and the very high carrying-power of the modern bullet, it will become, I think, more and more probable that a great deal of the operations of war will be carried on by night, and if it is difficult to attack by day it is twenty times more difficult to attack by night. But there comes a further consideration. The bullet is practically valueless at night, and the bayonet is considered by all experts the best weapon of offence and defence. So strongly do the Japanese realise the value of the bayonet that every one of their men is trained in barracks an hour every evening in exercises conducive to the strength of the arm and agility with the bayonet. Not only that, but every officer has to pass before his General in the use of the bayonet. How many men of the Territorial Force have ever been trained with the bayonet at all? If it were not for the competitions at the Military Tournament there would not be a couple of hundred men in the whole Force trained with the bayonet, and I think even now the number who know anything about bayonet fighting would not work out at one per cent. of the whole Force. The Japanese on every occasion when they met the Russians on a hill in about equal numbers were invariably, I believe, successful because of their greater skill with the bayonet. The Russians had also considerable skill with the bayonet, and so would any Continental army which invaded these islands. Yet we would propose to pit against these troops men never trained in any bayonet fighting at all, and who know nothing whatever about that part of the art of war.<lb/>
I believe the Secretary of State for War has said that no one contends that the Territorial Force is ready at the present moment to meet an invading force. If they are not to get their training in peace, when are they to get it? We are told that when the Expeditionary Force is mobilised the Territorial Force is also to be mobilised
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0466"/>
<col>881</col>
and to get its training. I think the House would be glad to know whether the noble Viscount would say that, had he been responsible at the War. Office in 1900, he would have mobilised the Territorial Force while the greater part of our Expeditionary Force was away and the greater part of our Reserves were mobilised. I venture to think that the noble Viscount would not make any statement of that kind. We should have been told by whatever Government was in power that as everything appeared to be peaceful throughout the world it was obviously unnecessary to mobilise the Territorial Force. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War shakes his head. Well, that is a thing which at any rate should be made clear to the Territorial Force. I am convinced that nine-tenths of them have not the faintest conception that supposing they had been in. existence in 1900 they would have been mobilised for six months. If that were known to the Territorial Force, the recruiting to that Force would not only diminish, but would practically cease altogether. If it can be stated that things appear peaceful throughout Europe and that therefore it is unnecessary that the Territorial Force should be mobilised, it will obviously be still more difficult to mobilise when matters are not so peaceful on the Continent. The diplomat will come down and say, "It is impossible for you to mobilise that force now. It will be taken as a threatening act against the Power or Powers with whom we are having some difference of opinion. It will make diplomacy still more difficult, and it will almost inevitably involve this country in war." Unless all these precautions are taken before we get into such a. situation, we shall not dare to do it when we are face to face with the situation itself.<lb/>
There is one further point. If it is necessary that the Territorial Force should have six months training before they meet a Continental army, I think the Secretary of State for War is squandering a good deal of public money under the scheme he has now in operation. Let him get up and say, "We will give the Territorial officers certain theoretical instruction. We will have the men of the Territorial Force up every year for one day in which they shall be medically examined and measured for their clothing and equipment, and then in time of mobilisation we shall give them seven months training instead of six," by
<col>882</col>
which time I think most experts would agree they would be as well trained as if they had six months training and a fortnight in each year. If we are wasting money on the Territorial Force at the present time and the Territorial Force is not fit to meet an army such as I have named, obviously the scheme I have suggested is preferable. We all know why such a scheme would not be adopted. The reason is obvious. At first the scheme might be popular throughout the country. It would lower the Estimates, and then the country in a short space of time would realise that the Force was entirely a paper Force, and that there was no second line between the Expeditionary Force and themselves, and there would be a demand for a proper Territorial Army. The Territorial Force is nothing better than a paper army, only it is put in such a way that the public do not realise the fact. If it were put forward that the men should come up for one day a year and then have seven months training on mobilisation the country would then realise what its position really is.<lb/>
I may be criticised for attacking the Force to which I belong, but I look at another side of the question. During the South African War a certain section of the Press and public made attacks which I think were, on the whole, utterly unjustified, against the training and the knowledge of officers and men of the Regular Army. It is a curious coincidence that the same section of the Press, and I believe to a large extent the same section of the public, are now attacking us for criticising the Territorial Force. If the Regular Army with the training it had before the war was not competent or considered adequately trained for fighting such a war without making grave mistakes, it is quite obvious that the Territorial Force cannot be adequate to the task that may be put before it by a possible invasion by 70,000 men. I feel that it is wiser and kinder to the Territorial Force that criticisms should be made now than that they should be made after they have been tried by the only trial which is worth having, the trial of actual experience of war, and have failed.<lb/>
It is not a question of public spirit, or a question of keenness, or a question of bravery with the Territorial Force. It is none of these. It is a question of the system, as was the case in South Africa.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0467"/>
<col>883</col>
The system has to be blamed, not the men. There are few if any Regular officers who are not prepared to say that the Territorial Force is extremely good. I agree with them. That it has a considerable amount of knowledge I entirely agree. But in every one of those cases you will find that these Regular officers qualify their statement with three extremely important words&#x2014;" under the circumstances." I entirely agree with those words. It is perfectly true that the Territorial Force has arrived at a stage of training a great deal above what could have been expected of it&#x2014;under the circumstances. The men know a great deal more, and, owing to their keenness, have arrived at a greatly higher stage of training than could possibly be expected of them; but to say that that stage of training is sufficient to place them opposite to an invading force of 70,000 of the best troops in Europe is a suggestion to which I for one cannot agree. For those reasons, and because I believe it is essential for this country that we should have an adequate home defence force, I shall warmly support the Motion proposed by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01761"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am satisfied that there is no noble Lord, in whatever part of this House he sits, who will not rejoice at the advent of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War in our debates, and more especially that his presence here is heralded by a debate of this importance. We have had a long and able statement from the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, who will not be angry with me if I say he is the protagonist of the system of universal military service, and we have had a reply from the Secretary of State for War, who is the creator of the present Army system under which we now live. I have one word of criticism which I hope the noble and gallant Field-Marshal will pardon. He said that the reductions carried out by the Secretary of State for War amounted to 30,000 men. I think I can prove to him in a few minutes that that is a very considerable exaggeration. The real reduction is only 18,500, as I can show from the Annual Reports. I think if the noble Earl who last spoke will reconsider his speech, he will find one considerable fallacy in it, because in his description of the state in which the Territorial Army would be he forgets altogether the 90,000 men of the Regular Army who would stiffen the Territorial Force and fight with them in defence of
<col>884</col>
these shores. If the noble Earl will look at the White Paper issued to us he will find that the total number of men liable for the Expeditionary Force is 163.000 men and officers; but on the next page be will find that there are 251,000 men fitted to go for service abroad, and the difference between these figures would be the men left behind to stiffen the Territorial Army. That makes a considerable difference in the noble Earl's calculation, and certainly in the result.<lb/>
Being anxious to be perfectly certain as to the amount of reductions which my noble friend has made in the Army, I have consulted the Annual Returns of the present year, and compared them with the last period for which the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, was responsible, and I will very shortly put them before the House. In the Cavalry and the Horse and Field Artillery, which, as we know, are very delicate arms and cannot possibly be improvised, there is no change whatever. The Household Cavalry have not been altered; they stand as before. The Cavalry of the Line on October 1, 1905, numbered 18,365 men; on October 1. 1910, there were 18,285. The Cavalry, therefore, are exactly as they stood before. The Royal Horse and Field Artillery numbered 29,363 in 1905; they number 29,587 in the present year; so that they have increased by 224. Then I come to reductions. There has been a large reduction in the Garrison Artillery, but, as the Secretary of State for War has explained very fully in another place, his main reason for changing these was to convert them into a sort of Reserve of the Royal Artillery. He found that of the batteries to go with the Expeditionary Force only 42 out of 54 batteries could be completed, so he turned some of the Garrison Artillery into ammunition columns and the Reserve of the Artillery. The Garrison Artillery, therefore, which stood at 23,121 on October 1905, stood at 17,592 in October, 1910, showing a reduction of 5,529.<lb/>
Now I come to the great reductions to which my noble friend has alluded. In the Infantry of the Line in the time of the noble Viscount opposite there were 146,147 men; now there are 137,390, or a reduction of 8,757. Noble Lords will recollect that during the war there were certain regiments, particularly the Northumberland Fusiliers and the Lancashire Fusiliers, which were increased from two to four battalions, but it was obvious that these were actually redundant to the general
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0468"/>
<col>885</col>
system. They were the only regiments which had four battalions except the Rifles, and therefore my noble friend took the opportunity of reducing those extra battalions in order that they might be fitted into his scheme, which was, that there should be exactly the same number of battalions abroad as at home, viz.: 74 at home and 74 abroad. Then there was a reduction in the Colonial Corps from 6,023 in 1905 to 3,830 in 1910&#x2014;a reduction of 2,993. There is also a reduction in the Guards of 650&#x2014;namely, from 7,730 in 1905 to 7,080 in 1910; but the fact was that the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, when in charge of the Department, raised those extra battalions of Guards in order that they might relieve the Mediterranean garrisons, to which they never went at all, and consequently they were found to be redundant. Two battalions were about to be disbanded, but one was found to be wanted in Egypt, so that battalion was saved from extinction, and one battalion only was reduced as redundant&#x2014;namely, the extra battalion of the Scots Guards.<lb/>
The total of the whole strength of officers in 1905 was 10,788; they are now 10,722. Warrant officers numbered 1,310 in 1905; now they number 1,292. Noncommissioned officers and rank and file numbered 260,035 in 1905; they now number 240,479. That is where, I think, the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts, was a little wrong. The aggregate reduction is, of course, 19,500; but you will find on looking at the Returns that 1,000 of these men are accounted for because in the time of Viscount Midleton 5,000 men were taken from the Indian Line and employed in China and in other garrisons, and only 4,000 in the present year. Fewer men by 1,000 were borrowed from the Indian list, but are not reduced, and that makes the total reductions only 18,500. I think we ought to see what we have got in compensation for these reductions. The first is the splendid Reserve which we possess. The Army Reserve in September, 1905, taking sections A, B, and D, was 94,770. The present total of the Army Reserve, taking the same sections, is 135,712&#x2014;a magnificent Reserve, and I believe my noble friend the Secretary of State for War stated the other day that it has since increased to 137,000.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01764"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to hear it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01765"><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: I wish first to say that of this splendid list of 137,000 men there are 93,000 under thirty years of age, and 132,000, virtually all, under thirty-five years of age. All these men have gone through Colour service, some for seven years and some for less, but they are all seasoned soldiers it the prime of life. When connected with the War Office I had the opportunity of seeing them when called out, owl except being slightly older, they could not, be distinguished from their comrades. I am aware, of course, that there will be a large reduction in two or three years time, when men will go out, and we shall have the normal Reserve very much reduced, but it will be reduced only to about 103,000 men; it will still be, according to my noble friend's calculations, over 100,000. But there is this to be remembered, that if the men are not in the Reserve they are longer in the ranks, and that is a very important consideration. If they are to remain seven years in the ranks, they will be equally as good as if they are in the Reserve. In addition to that, it is possible that my noble friend the Secretary of State for War may increase the feeding cadres, and then you would have larger numbers going to the Reserve. There is such a plan as giving men bounties to exchange from the Line into the Reserve. There are various ways, but you cannot tell what the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War will do two years hence. He is, however, keenly alive to the need of keeping up this magnificent Reserve; in fact, he pledges himself to watch carefully how it is reduced, and will take steps to see that the Reserve is not emptied too rapidly.<lb/>
Then my noble friend spoke of the Expeditionary Force. As to that I think we only require to hear what the Secretary of State for War said in the other House&#x2014;
<quote>"The six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force, as I said last year, have the whole of their fighting personnel, non-commissioned officers and men, ready. The equipment and stores are there."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0469"/>
<col>887</col>
I do not think we need be very much afraid as far as the Expeditionary Force is concerned. But I would like to say a word with regard to the supply of officers after the Expeditionary Force is supposed to have gone. There, I think, my noble friend has some apprehensions, but he has taken precautions to find a very large number of officers by means of the Officers Training Corps, and it is now of very considerable strength. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War said on March 7, 1910&#x2014;
<quote>"For efficient mobilisation we look to the Officers Training Corps, which was called into existence for the purpose. To mobilise the six Divisions there is no deficiency, but to provide for units left at home be should require to draw largely from the Reserve of officers."</quote>
The great benefit of the Officers Training Corps is that it is worked in connection with the public schools and the Universities. The young men are selected for their physique by their masters, and are given particular advantages in obtaining commissions. If they pass certificate A they get off three months, if they pass certificate B they get off six months, and these are great attractions to them in qualifying for commissions. The noble Viscount was able to say in March, 1910&#x2014;
<quote>"The Officers Training Corps, which was designed to give us the means of tilling up our great deficiency&#x2014;namely, subalterns&#x2014;will, I hope, next year reach the very respectable total of 21,000 candidates in the public schools and Universities. Just now it is nearly 20,000."</quote>
There is every reason to hope that we shall obtain the 21,000 in the current year. Besides that, the noble Viscount is taking other steps. He has spent a large sum upon the enlargement of Sandhurst, and the terms are all changed now, so that a very much longer course is given to the officers who join there. But what I think noble Lords will look upon with great sympathy is the system of scholarships inaugurated by my noble friend, because although we may not look upon it as a magnificent thing when a man gets a scholarship of &#x00A3;50 a year and a grant of &#x00A3;35 for his outfit, yet it is established that when these candidates are successful they will save one half of their expenses in their Sandhurst course. The most excellent part of that is, that it will attract a great number of the sons of clergymen and barristers, and so on, and will enable people of that class to send their sons into the Army at much less expense than heretofore.<lb/>
<col>888</col>
I will say one or two words about the Territorial Army. I happen to be the Chairman of one of the County Associations, and I must say we are very much indebted to the noble Viscount for what he has done for us this year. For the moment I should like to compare this Force with the old Volunteers. The Volunteers were isolated corps, scattered in different parts of the country, and never called together except in a battalion. They rarely had a Brigade drill. They were inspected once a year, perhaps, by a General officer who never saw them again. Now we have a great force, larger than the Volunteers, divided into fourteen Divisions, every one of which is commanded by an officer of distinction. They have Brigadiers and Brigade Majors from the Regulars. A certain proportion of the Force were taken for man&#x0153;uvres this autumn with Regular troops, and went out on absolutely campaign conditions. But the best feature of all is the number who attended camp. There were 168,000, including 7,000 officers, who attended camp for fifteen days, and 73,000 for eight days or less. Including the Yeomanry, 243,000 members of the Territorial Force attended camp last year, and that is against 179,000 who attended camp in the year before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01766"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to interrupt the noble Lord, but perhaps he will state how many did not attend camp. That is the other side of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01767"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: It would be very few out of 277,000. Of course, there must be a considerable number of so large a force who were away on reasonable excuse, although I know there were a few who had no excuse. Altogether 62 per cent. attended camp for fifteen days, and 28 per cent. for eight days&#x2014;that is 90 per cent. of the total number. In addition to that, upwards of 1,000 officers and 17,000 men have undertaken engagement for foreign service. Something has been said as to the statement which fell from my noble friend in reference to the meeting at which Colonel Repington's paper was read. We had important evidence from the General officers who attended that dinner, and who expressed their opinion of the Territorial Force. I will quote them. General Macready said that&#x2014;
<quote>"Discipline was the paramount necessity of good fighting, and in that matter the Territorials were far superior to the old Volunteers."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0470"/>
<col>889</col>
General Bullock said&#x2014;
<quote>"They who were working with the Territorial Force believed that the present system of the Territorial Army was a scientific and honest endeavour to give them the defensive force they required."</quote>
I think that is very important. General Bethune said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Territorial Force in West Lancashire had increased in efficiency from top to bottom about 20 per cent. in each of the last two years."</quote>
General Henniker said&#x2014;
<quote>"There was an enormous improvement in the Artillery, which only wanted more training."</quote>
I am very glad to give those views, because I think we ought to have some counterblast to the rather cold douche which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal poured upon us from the Cross Benches.<lb/>
I should like to bear my testimony to the gallant way in which my noble friend Viscount Haldane has supported the Territorial Force this year. He is going to spend the sum of &#x00A3;206,000 more. He is going to add &#x00A3;68,000 to the establishment grant. Travelling expenses are to be increased from 127,000 to &#x00A3;45,000 to enable men to attend drills. The sum of &#x00A3;30,000 is to be given to General officers' for carrying out training, and &#x00A3;50,000 for the upkeep of targets and rifle ranges. We wish to thank him very much for all that. We had a meeting on Saturday of my Territorial Association, and every officer was loud in praise of the way in which the noble Viscount has treated us. It is not only that he has given us money. He has settled, as Lord Dartmouth well knows, a very difficult question. He has settled the vexed question of the secretaries' salaries by raising the maximum to &#x00A3;170 a year, and, as I said before, he has given us a large sum which we may use for travelling allowances in bringing men up to drill and to meet the battalions. I have felt it my duty to say these things on behalf of the Territorial Force, and I am sure that the noble Viscount, when he gives up his office, will be able to feel that in establishing the Territorial Force he has added very much to the security and strength, and, therefore, to the material prosperity of this country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01772"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: If you wait till tomorrow, perhaps you will see. I would like before I pass from the last speaker to ask one question. I agree with most of the laudatory comments which were made on the part of the Generals who attended the dinner the other night. I would entirely subscribe to what was said as to the encouragement which the noble. Viscount the Secretary of State for War has given to the Territorial Force, and especially the great thought and care which he has taken in every particular branch of it. I recognise the admirable work which these men have done, the attempts that the officers have made to qualify themselves for the work, and the improvement which has been made in the Territorial Force. But I would like to ask, Did any one of those Generals say that these men were fit to take their place in war? As to the 90,000 men who the noble Lord (Lord Haversham) said were not counted, but who would reinforce&#x2014;"stiffen" was the word used&#x2014;the Territorial Force, I think the only way I should be able to use that term towards those 90,000 men would be in the way that a Scottish gillie talks of a fish being stiff at the bottom of a pool. Certainly any one who examined these 90,000 men would see that almost all of them are under twenty years of age; they are not organised in brigades; the majority of them would join the Special Reserve, but they have no means of transport. How they would "stiffen" the Territorial Force is not exactly to be seen on the face of it. If they would stiffen them, they would stiffen them in the sense of remaining behind while the others would do the fighting.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0471"/>
<col>891</col>
There is no means of knowing how these 90,000 boys would be taken into the field, so that the term "stiffen" is not altogether applicable.<lb/>
I turn to the speech made by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War. He raised certain points which I would like for a moment to consider. The first of these, on which he based a great deal of his argument, was the question of naval opinion. Earl Stanhope has dealt admirably with that question. But may I be allowed to add a few instances to show how naval opinion has always said invasion was impossible? The noble Viscount referred to a certain meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence at which this matter of invasion was considered. May I remind him of instances where naval opinion went wrong? The most recent, and the most often quoted, of course, is that of Russian naval opinion, which definitely laid down that invasion was absolutely impossible as long as the Russian Fleet remained in being. Lord Nelson was one of the Admirals quoted by the Secretary of State for War. May I mention also that Lord Nelson, to a large extent, held that opinion. Yet at one of the most critical times in our history he was three weeks late with the whole of our Fleet. Naval opinion is a thing we can use for argument, but it is not one necessarily on which we can absolutely rely.<lb/>
There is a second point in this connection. The Secretary of State for War referred to the two Committees on which he sat and which considered the question of invasion. The first Committee, which sat under Mr. Balfour, gave a limit of 10,000 men. The next Committee gave the figure of the possible invading force as 70.000. Admitting the last figure, and that 70,000 men landed, those 70,000 men can tie exactly the same number of men as the original 10,000, and therefore, <i>pro tanto</i>, our Expeditionary Force and the Fleet is constantly reduced. The noble Viscount passed on to another point; in fact, it was almost the most important point that he made in his speech; and that was the question of the "possible" and the "reasonably probable." He said that we were not to consider a combination of Powers which was not of a reasonably probable order. The weak point of this argument lies in this, that what is reasonably probable to-day need
<col>892</col>
not be reasonably probable five years hence. It takes ten years to create an Army. I need not argue that point. We have seen the experience of Germany, and we know that of France. In every case ten years is the time accepted by military critics. Let us glance at the big Powers of Europe, and see how we stood with them ten years ago. With Russia we are friendly to-day. Who could have said that ten years ago? Germany in those days was our friend, and France was supposed to be the most likely nation to invade us. Well, we have France now on the best of terms. Can any one prophesy what, ten years hence, may be the combinations against us? I think this absolutely breaks down the question of the logically possible and the reasonably probable.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, raised another point about the question of submarines and the fleet of transports which is to come across to these shores. He says that even if this fleet escaped our battleships, how would they escape our submarines? Why should not the Germans blow up some of our: battleships? This is one of the largest of all assumptions. Why should our Fleets be able to lie off the large German ports from which invasion is possible, when we know that for five years now Germany has been pushing on with submarines at the rate of a million a year in their Naval Estimates? Why should we imagine that one of our battleships could lie off a port&#x2014;a most dangerous naval operation&#x2014;whilst no,-, one of the enemy's warships had been placed on the protection of the transports which were to fall victims to our submarines?<lb/>
We have had now from headquarters a statement that the Territorial Army in theory is never to be an efficient Army in time of peace. We have heard the reassertion of that wonderful old idea that we are going to have six months' war before we need use our Territorial Force. Our Expeditionary Force cannot be in two places at one time. If you send two Divisions away, no one can tell when you will want others to reinforce them, and if you send any considerable portion of your Expeditionary Force away it presupposes absolutely that at any moment it may have to be reinforced with the remainder or you abandon those two or three Divisions to their fate. It is curious that we should
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0472"/>
<col>893</col>
go back to this six months idea. If you took abroad you see the nations straining at the leash. I went along the French frontier not long ago, and visited some of the houses there. Every peasant knew exactly where he had to go and where to send his horse and his cows on the outbreak of war. At a single moment everybody and everything was to go to the appointed place. It was the question of a day that they were reckoning on. Here we are counting on six months. The whole of Europe is turned into one great armed camp, and still we talk of six months notice before anything is to happen at all. I am sure that future generations will wonder, when they come to read the reports of the various debates on this question, that there were people who imagined there would be this warning of six months.<lb/>
We do not wish in this debate to make disparaging remarks about the Territorial Army. We want to get the Territorial Army up to that point which we wish it to arrive at&#x2014;namely, that it shall be properly efficient and be of real serviceable use to the country. I would recall the quotation made by the Secretary of State for War from what fell from Colonel Repington, to the effect that at the present moment two regiments of Yeomanry were equal to one regiment of Regular Cavalry, and that after two and a-half months training two Yeomanry regiments would be practically equal to a Continental Cavalry regiment. I do not wish, of course, to doubt the noble Viscount's statement, because he read it from a newspaper But two Generals who were at the dinner stated that Colonel Repington made the statement only for purposes of discussion when he raised these two points. I challenge him to prove it in any print he wishes. He has great opportunities of stating his views in <i>The Times</i>, and perhaps he will show exactly on what he bases this statement that two Yeomanry regiments are equal to one Continental Cavalry regiment. Look for a moment to the two things. The period of training of the British Yeomanry is very short in comparison with that of the Cavalry in Continental armies. Our Yeomanry have no training with the <i>arme blanche</i>. The Japanese, so far as the bayonet is concerned, give their men the most excellent training. Yet we have no bayonet in the Yeomanry; we have not seen a bayonet;
<col>894</col>
at least, we have not seen one for three years. Neither have we swords. If we are attacked by Cavalry we have no bayonets with which to drive them off.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01773"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Lord suggest that the Cavalry should be armed with bayonets</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01774"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I believe the Germans are going to retain the lance and give their Cavalry the bayonet.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01776"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I am delighted to supply it. Then with regard to the rifle, may I point out that our Yeomanry would be armed with weapons with fixed sights at 500 yards. The Continental Cavalry have rifles which have fixed sights at over 300 yards further. We do not compete on fair terms. If there was one point which the Boer war brought out absolutely&#x2014;and I am sure all Cavalry men will support me in this&#x2014;it was the fact that we went into that war with a very inferior weapon. I am sure that the noble and gallant Field-Marshal will support me in that, that no body of men could have been in a worse condition than our Cavalry were when they fought the Boers. On the question of horses I need not say anything to-night, as I understand that Lord Willoughby de Broke will speak on that. On the question of Staff, I may say that if we are to wait until the day of mobilisation occurs we shall not be as right as the Germans. Then with regard to the question of the movement, of Brigades. There are very few officers who handle Brigades twice in a year, and that as a rule in camp. The average Brigadier only handles Yeomanry four or eight times in the whole of his period. The handling of a Yeomanry Brigade is quite different from the handling of a Cavalry Brigade. The time and calculation and space are all different. They are absolutely and entirely opposite. And finally, you have the question of the machine guns and transports. We have a very second rate machine gun. Almost all Continental armies have a very much better one, and one which is fairly easy and much better to manipulate. As regards transport, Cavalry transport is practically universally conducted now on motors and by rapid methods of that sort, while we still have our improvised trans-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0473"/>
<col>895</col>
port, without general service wagons. I do not wish to labour this point; but Colonel Repington's statement that one regiment of Yeomanry to-day is equal to half its weight of Cavalry trained on the Continental system is one that it is very difficult to defend. I do not wish for a moment to ignore what the Yeomanry have done. I believe the keenness of the Yeomanry throughout is excellent; but can you expect these men to do in a few days training the proper amount of work necessary to pit themselves in any way against Continental trained troops or to face anything like a fifth of their own number? The noble Lord, Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, has challenged us for not producing some scheme. I do not think it lies with the Back Benches of the Opposition to produce any scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01777"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I did not challenge the noble Lord. I challenged the noble and gallant Field-Marshal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01778"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I beg your pardon; but Lord Roberts sits on the Cross Benches, so he has still even less opportunity for producing a scheme. But if we do not produce a scheme, we can produce an object; and the object of the majority of noble Lords on this side of the House and of the nation is that we should have a sufficient defence force for this country so as to free absolutely our Fleet to carry out its duties anywhere in the world and to free the whole of our Expeditionary Force to leave these shores.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01779"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when the formation of the Territorial Force was under discussion your Lordships were good enough to allow me on two or three different occasions to speak more or less on the Territorial Artillery, because that is a question on which I have a certain amount of experience, and I think perhaps I was the only one in this House who had done any actual work with the old Volunteer Artillery previous to the formation of the Territorial Force. For that reason, I do not want to touch much upon the general question to-day, except to say that it seems to me that all this talk in which we are indulging with regard to the Expeditionary Force, and 150,000, or 70,000, or any other number, is so purely conjectural as to be really rather beating the bush, and almost a waste of time when we are considering the very much larger questions
<col>896</col>
raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Milner. What I think we have to remember is that great and important <i>r&#x00F4;le</i> which this country might be called upon to take in having to bear a share in the preservation of the balance of power in Europe, and that the. possibility of offensive action along with another nation on the other side of the Channel may be, after all, the real means of defending this country against dangers which we cannot combat afterwards. That is the great question which we have to remember, and it opens up the weak point in the Territorial Army&#x2014;the weak point of the scheme which says that the Territorial Army is not really supposed to be ready for immediate use because it will always have six months to prepare during which time the Expeditionary Force will remain in this country. If the Expeditionary Force have to leave in a hurry in order to take its part in preserving the balance of power in Europe and preventing a situation which would afterwards produce a sort of panic on our shores, then it is all the more necessary that our Second Line should be as well prepared as we are able to get it.<lb/>
And that brings me to the question of the Artillery, because it is a notorious fact admitted by everybody, that the Artillery is a branch which it is most difficult to train. It not only takes longer to train than any other, but it requires certain special circumstances and facilities to enable you to train it at all. There is no denying the fact, therefore, that if you admit that the Expeditionary Force might be called away upon very short notice, it is all the more important that the Artillery upon which the Territorial Force will have to rely should be really effective, and should not be a sham force which might simply be an encumbrance to other troops when they came to enclosed and difficult country. When we had the discussions in your Lordships' House with regard to the formation of the Territorial Force the point which I ventured to bring out as a result of my own experience and observation of several years was that I did not believe in the possibility of the effectual training of large forces of Territorial Artillery in this country. I do not in the least wish to depreciate the hard work which is done by all the Territorial Artillery, both officers and men. I join in everything which fell from my noble friend behind me and from the noble
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0474"/>
<col>897</col>
Lord opposite, who spoke in favour of the spirit of the Territorial troops and the way in which they work, the keenness whit they display, and the remarkable manner in which they have improved since they came into being; but I do maintain, with regard to the Territorial Artillery, that I is quite impossible that a large force o Territorial Artillery such as we have at the present moment can have a fair chance o making themselves really efficient under the circumstances in which they have t work. The main reason is that with a volunteer force such as the Territorial Fore you are obliged to study the convenience of the members of that force. If you do riot, you will not get the men. You an obliged to study their convenience ii laying down the times that they are to come out into camp, the length of time they are to stay there, and the stringency of the regulations which you are going to impose upon them for the purpose o trying to get them to stay the full length of time. You may have all sorts of systems of fines and regulations, but any practical man knows perfectly well that if you are going to make these fines and regulations too hard or too stringent; if you are not going to allow individual cases of hardship amongst the men to be considered; if you are not going to give them leave to be absent from camp on very likely what appears to be flimsy excuses but which may be very important ones connected with their private business, you will injure recruiting, and you will not get the men. There is no getting away from that. Therefore you must administer the regulations in what may be regarded as a somewhat lax spirit. The fact remains that as long as you have this volunteer force, you are obliged to consider the convenience of the men and the officers as to when you are going to get them out to training.<lb/>
The time of training, unfortunately, owing to these considerations, has to be very limited. The greater portion of the Territorial Force are obliged to come out either at Whitsuntide or the first fortnight in August. Now, what does the training of Territorial Artillery consist of? Some- times attention is called to the actual time they are in camp and the practical work they do there. That is of the utmost importance; in fact, it is quite impossible to train them properly unless you get your men in camp. At the same time I think
<col>898</col>
it is an exaggeration of the case to ignore too much the excellent work which is done by the Territorial troops at their head, quarters and on odd days during the year, without which it would be quite impossible for them to put themselves into such a state of efficiency as to make their time in camp really useful.<lb/>
Let us see what the training of the Army really consists of. You have, first of all, your company training. You have your battalion training and your Brigade training. You harden your men by constant marches; you do night work and other sort of work, finally culminating in a great burst of autumn man&#x0153;uvres where yon put to a practical test all that the men are supposed to have learned during the drill season. I submit, as the result of expel licence now extending over a good many years, that the only way in which you can get work out of Auxiliary Artillery is by making the culminating point during the year their camp, followed immediately by practice on the range. There is a good deal of work that can be taught in barracks. You can teach the ordinary Artilleryman, the gunner, five-sixths of his work in barracks, because modern gun drill is so very much mechanical, and the gunner is more or less a machine. The whole efficiency of the Artillery depends upon its working together, under the commanding officer and the officers. The whole efficiency of the Artillery depends upon the powers of observation of the commanding officer, and the efficiency of the gunners. If the commanding officer cannot be certain of the precision with which the gun layers have laid the gun; if they say they have laid it right and they have laid it wrong, it is perfectly impossible for him to have a correct observation of fire, and if his gun-layers play him tricks simply from the fact of their bad training, it is impossible for any commanding officer to conduct good gun practice with any battery. Therefore the efficiency of the Artillery depends upon the accurate preparation of the men, working, if you like, like machines, but at the same time it is absolutely necessary that the commanding officer and the gun-layers and the officers should have practised outside the barrack square, because you want to make them realise what distance targets are, and you want to teach your gun-layers that laying on a distance target 3,000 or 4,000 yards
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0475"/>
<col>899</col>
away is a totally different thing from laying on a white spot on a barrack wall at 50 yards range. Those are all practical questions which very likely do not appeal to the ordinary person who has not had experience of Artillery, but the point is this, that all this work, in order to be really effective, should be followed by your camp, where you teach your men in man&#x0153;uvres; and in man&#x0153;uvres it is quite as important as shooting, though not quite, that you must be able to get your battery into a certain position and get it away if necessary with case and speed. At the same time it is not a bit of good getting a battery into position if it cannot shoot, but man&#x0153;uvring is nearly as important as the actual shooting, and you have the practice in that culminating in what ought to be three or four days at least of actual practice upon your gun range.<lb/>
One of the noble Lords who spoke tonight&#x2014;I think it was 'Lord Stanhope&#x2014;spoke of the drudgery which has to be undergone by the ordinary individual who comes from civil life and sets himself to work to learn the duties of a soldier. If you want men to put themselves not only to very great inconvenience in giving up their private time, but very often to considerable personal loss in neglecting their business to undergo this drudgery, it is of the greatest importance to make that drudgery as interesting as possible. If you do, you get it done twice as well. My experience is that you can make the work of Artillery fifty times more interesting if you can cultivate a spirit of emulation amongst your different batteries, and if you can close your season with gun practice, the results of which will enable you to see, and also allow the men to see for themselves, what the real efficiency of the battery is in practical work. But, unfortunately, the time is short, as I said before. You can only bring out your men as a rule at two periods in the year. The ranges available in this country are few. All the Regular forces have to be trained as well as the Territorial Force, and the result is that during the last five years practice has been absolutely spoiled for the whole of the Territorial Artillery, and has been reduced very nearly to a farce. Ever since Salisbury Plain was opened in the year 1900 I have been down there with the two batteries which I have the honour to command. For the first eight years up till the time of
<col>900</col>
the formation of the Territorial Force we conducted our practice upon the lines which I have mentioned. We carried out our work at headquarters, and had a great deal of drill on Saturday afternoons, in which we were greatly helped by the Horse Artillery at St. John's Wood and by odd afternoons at Aldershot, where we were also helped by the Horse Artillery, and then we went down to Salisbury Plain and finished up by having our three days gun practice upon the ranges there. I am perfectly certain that the good reputation which I am proud to think the Artillery batteries earned amongst Artillery officers was very largely caused by our being able to follow that routine.<lb/>
What happened when the Territorial Force was created? There was a general scramble for the ranges, and the result was they were spoiled for everybody. The year before last we were all down at Salisbury Plain. It was impossible to use the ranges there, and batteries had to be sent down to Okehampton. They went down by night train, with their horses, arriving at Okehampton about 6 o'clock in the morning; they went on parade about 8 o'clock, fired off a great many rounds in a very hurried way for three hours in the morning, and the same thing next morning, and then went back again. They were replaced by another battery, which also came down in the night. One battery followed another at these Okehampton ranges, with the result that although we had a great many recruits that year no one got proper instruction, and I maintain that the practice was to a great extent wasted. Last year the whole of the practice that our two batteries got was confined to one day, as it was impossible to get half the batteries on to the ranges. This year we were to be permitted to go down for two Saturday afternoons to Shoeburyness&#x2014;an absolute waste of ammunition and public money&#x2014;for the purpose of training Horse Artillery. Fortunately I had been able to arrange something. I found there was a <i>hiatus</i> between two Regular brigades at Salisbury Plain just when we were in camp, and so by special favour of the officers commanding the Royal Horse Artillery Camp we were able to make arrangements to have our three days practice there this year, but it was pure chance that we were able to get on.<lb/>
That sort of thing is going on all over the country, and I respectfully maintain that it
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0476"/>
<col>901</col>
is perfectly impossible to train a large force. of Auxiliary Artillery upon lines of this description. One thing is most important&#x2014;it is too often overlooked&#x2014;namely, that you must have ample opportunities beforehand of teaching your men to ride and drive before they go down to camp. If when your men arrive in camp they are not well up in what I will call the elementals, a great deal of your time in camp is wasted, and therefore the practicability of training Territorial Artillery depends, in my humble judgment, very largely upon the locality in which they are. I do not believe it is possible to efficiently train this large force of Territorial Artillery at the present moment; but I believe if you select your place, more especially in conjunction with batteries of Regular Artillery, and where it is possible for them to go out into the country and get some experience of working in close country, which we cannot possibly do in London&#x2014;and that is one reason why London is an unsuitable place for a large force of the Territorial Artillery&#x2014;if you do that, you have a much better chance of making your batteries really efficient and able to do useful work when you do get them into camp.<lb/>
I do not wish to labour these details too much, but still they are details upon which the whole question of Artillery training depends, and it is a great mistake to ignore the opinions of those who have had the working of them and who realise their importance. Therefore it comes down to this, that it is quite possible to have a certain number of very useful and efficient auxiliary batteries of Artillery in this country, but if you want to have and to continue to maintain the large force of Artillery which you have at present, you must be content to regard them not as efficient Artillery to your Territorial Force, but merely as a sort of reserve of men accustomed to the handling of guns and ammunition. I can tell the Secretary of State for War that that is the deliberate opinion expressed to me in private conversation of officers high up in the Royal Artillery, who have had ample opportunities of judging for themselves of the real value of the Territorial Artillery. I do not know what they may put in official reports, but very often people say a great deal more of what they think in private conversation than they do in official reports; and what I have been told by men whose judgment I am certain the Secretary of State for War
<col>902</col>
himself would place great reliance in is that you must not look upon the large mass of Territorial Artillery as more than reserves of men who have learned gun drill, and who may very likely be wanted as extra reinforcements to the general forces of Artillery in the event of war.<lb/>
There is only one point of detail I should like to mention. It is as to whether we have not far too many of these batteries armed with field gum. I am sure it would be very much more practical to arm them instead with what is known as "pom poms," or a weapon of that description, which would be of more use, and more handy for the class of fighting which would probably go on in our enclosed country, in our country lanes and in the parts of the country where you can very often get a range of not more than about 1,500 to 2,000 yards on account of the hedge rows and the hedge-row timber. I do not believe it would be possible in many places in our eastern counties to do any good whatever with large forces of Artillery. I believe that in the event of fighting in many of our enclosed districts the Artillery work would very likely be carried on by sections of Artillery. It would not be a question of fighting Artillery in mass but in sections, and very often the work would have to be quick and sharp and the Artillery would have to be moved about from one place to another.<lb/>
It would be of very great assistance if some arrangements could be made for providing a range or an exercise ground where the Territorial Artillery could have some experience of work Jin enclosed country. Take these London batteries; they never get anywhere except to Wormwood Scrubbs, Primrose Hill, or Woolwich Common. They go into camp, at Aldershot or Shoeburyness or Salisbury Plain, but they never get an opportunity of going down a country lane, or going in and out of a gate, or of man&#x0153;uvring in enclosed country such as they would be obliged to move in if they were called upon in an emergency to meet a foreign invader on these shores. We never train our men to fight upon the very places which we know would only be chosen by an invading army. We give them no possible opportunities of perfecting themselves in work on enclosed country. No wonder our Territorial batteries ate found deficient in training. One noble Lord whose military opinions I know your Lordships all value
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0477"/>
<col>903</col>
very much&#x2014;I will not mention his name&#x2014;was telling me this afternoon of an incident which came under his notice in connection with a Territorial battery last autumn. He went to look at it, and saw the gate through which they had passed on turning out of the road. He was particularly gratified that they had not carried away the gate posts, and he remarked upon this fact, but a farmer who was standing there and had seen them come through made an observation which caused the noble Lord to inquire further, and he found that they had carefully taken their horses out, and drawn the guns through the gate by hand. There was no difficulty with regard to this particular gate, but still you cannot expect troops even to try to perform simple man&#x0153;uvres such as going through a gate unless you give them proper opportunities of practising.<lb/>
I thank your Lordships for allowing me to give vent to these particular views on this subject. I only wish to say, in conclusion, that I cordially join with all that has been said with regard to the many good points in the Territorial scheme. I do not deny for one minute that the Territorial Forces are a very great advance upon the old Volunteer Forces. The organisation is a great improvement. The work done by the men is a great improvement. I think the County Associations were a stroke of genius on the part of the Secretary of State for War, and have been the means of bringing public interest into the life of the Territorial Force. The Officers Training Corps is a very valuable institution, and altogether the spirit and work of the men are of the very best. But we cannot expect impossibilities. We have to remember that the good points which have been praised must always be taken in conjunction with the phrase which fell from Lord Stanhope&#x2014;" Under the circumstances." I do not believe that it is possible to have a really practical and efficient force of Territorial Artillery and one which can be regarded as competent to take its line and place, even after a considerable amount of training, if it is necessary to maintain so large a one as we have at present in the Territorial Artillery.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01780"><member>LORD WYNFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to support the Motion which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal has moved I shall confine my remarks, as the previous
<col>904</col>
speaker, Lord Denbigh, did, to the Territorial Artillery. I have paid some attention to this branch of the Territorial Army, and I am bound to confess that I view their slow progress with considerable concern. In saying this it is far from my desire to disparage the efforts of the noncommissioned officers and men of these batteries, for I can say with all sincerity that I have never come across more zealous and painstaking soldiers. But I honestly think, more so now than ever, that under the present system of training you will be unable to get efficient Field Artillery, and I am still of the opinion expressed by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal some three years ago that partially trained Artillery in war are useless, and only a danger to their own side.<lb/>
I presume that nobody will deny that these Territorial batteries at the present moment are quite unable to take the field against trained Artillery, leaving aside entirely the very serious question of the provision of horses. I think their staunchest adherents will admit that. What we have to consider is whether under their present system of training these batteries will ever be able to reach such a standard even at the end of the six months training which our opponents are to so graciously allow us that they will be fit to meet trained Artillery in the field. I think I can convince your Lordships that, generally speaking, they will not be able to do so. I say generally speaking, because units vary to a great extent. I have in my mind one or two in a northern county and one in a midland county commanded by officers whom it would be very hard to replace, and units which are trained under these exceptional circumstances might prove of some service. I also except, of course, the Honourable Artillery Company, where the batteries have existed for many years and where there is an excellent school of training. They are commanded by Lord Denbigh, an able Artillery officer who has been a great factor in promoting their efficiency.<lb/>
A battery must be able to move, and it must be able to shoot. If it fails in either respect, it is useless for war purposes. Let me first take the question of mobility. One of the lessons that we learned during the South African war was the waste of horse flesh owing, to a very large extent, to a lack of the most elementary principles
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0478"/>
<col>905</col>
of horsemanship. Yet His Majesty's Government expect three untrained men&#x2014;I will not call them untrained, but under-trained men&#x2014;to drive six untrained horses, arid to take a ton and a half any distance and get into any position. The experiment was carried out last, autumn, when a Division was mobilised at the man&#x0153;uvres, and Special Reservists were employed as drivers of the ammunition wagons. Your Lordships are, of course, unaware of the difficulties that Regular officers in charge of these men have to contend against, moving along roads with untrained horses and with drivers who have only had six months training. Can Territorial Artillery drivers be expected to do any better, particularly when you have only very inexperienced officers to assist them? The Secretary of State for War can, no doubt quote opinions of General officers on the excellence of the driving of these batteries in the past year, but I think Lord Stanhope brought out the same point that I wish to make&#x2014;namely, that if you examine these reports carefully, in nearly every case you will find some such qualifying remark as "considering the amount of training," or "under the circumstances."<lb/>
It must not be forgotten, also, that these batteries carried no service ammunition, which means a very great reduction of weight behind the horses. I will only add that at one practice camp last year serious delay occurred and considerable difficulty was experienced in bringing a battery into action, and that over a distance of only a few hundred yards. What will such batteries do on service? Last autumn the practice of some of these batteries, presumably the pick of them, came under my personal observation. I will acknowledge that the drill of the organised part of the service was quite good. They were quick and smart in the little details of the service, and all ranks exhibited intense keenness, but to those who know and understand the general effect was very slow. The work of the specialist was very indifferent and unreliable, the observation of fire was bad, and the results of the practice extremely poor. And this against an easy target visible to the naked eye, one that would rarely occur on service, and one that would make a Regular battery commander's mouth water. The optimistic statements on public platforms and the glowing accounts in the newspapers each year
<col>906</col>
give, to my mind, an entirely false idea to the public of the standard which has been achieved.<lb/>
I will ask you to allow me to quote one such account, by no means the most flattering or eulogistic, to serve my purpose. The <i>Daily Chronide</i> at the end of last September, in describing a practice which had taken place, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The tests to which le specific batteries were subjected at Okehampton were the same that would be applied to Regulars, and they were judged by Regular officers."</quote>
Of course, these batteries were not judged by the same standard as Regular batteries, neither in respect to their drill, nor the conduct of fire, nor of the length of time that they were firing. I am quite convinced that the practice shooting of the Territorial Field Artillery, as they are being trained at present and as at present constituted, will never be more than purely instructional and elementary. If it is the case that their training is carried out. as it is now under the supervision of efficient Regular officers with instructors and with horses which are easily obtainable, how in the world will they be able to reach the necessary standard after mobilisation in the stress and strain which will inevitably occur, when there will be immense difficulty in providing the necessary instructors and horses, and when all the batteries would be required to use a limited number of ranges at about the same time?<lb/>
I think I am right in stating that at the present moment there are only three ranges available in this country where practice can be carried out. I am not counting the one in Ire/and. There is, I believe, no range in the north of England; it has yet, to be provided. No doubt it is partly owing to the paucity of ranges that the Secretary of State for War stated that Territorial batteries would practice every other year instead of annually. So that instead of the opportunities for shooting being increased, they will actually he diminished. To obtain anything approaching efficient Territorial Artillery you must either considerably lengthen the present period of annual training and give them more officers as instructors and a larger Permanent Staff, or you must train them on the lines of the Special Reserve by giving them their initial training of six months with a shorter period in successive years. In present conditions I do
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0479"/>
<col>907</col>
not see how they are to improve themselves. The officers and non-commissioned officers have not had sufficient experience to instruct their men, and they have to rely on the Permanent Staff and the adjutants. A great many of the adjutants are subalterns of only a few years service, and it is perfectly ridiculous to suppose that under these conditions the senior ranks can be properly instructed in practical work. One thing I am quite sure of, and that is that if hard work and zeal could make a battery we should have the finest Artillery in the world, but the business of the drill book and all the rest of the work have to be applied on the field, and there is no opportunity, or very scanty opportunity, for doing this.<lb/>
The Military Correspondent of <i>The Times</i>, in an issue of that paper last October, compared the French methods of Artillery with our own. I do not intend to express an opinion on that matter now; but I should like to mention that a very capable Artillery officer and one very well able to give an opinion wrote an article in the <i>Artillery Journal</i> last December, in which he explained that our Artillery had been armed on certain principles of conduct of fire, and that the adoption of the French method would probably entail the rearmament of the whole of our Artillery. But the writer of the article in <i>The Times</i> endeavoured to show that the simpler methods of our neighbours were far better suited to Territorials. I will ask you to believe me when I say that celerity of decision and promptness of action are of equal importance in either case, and these cannot be obtained without experience and practice, in addition to which under the French method the waste of ammunition is a very serious consideration indeed. Under modern conditions the battery gains which is quickest in finding the range and bringing an effective fire to bear on its opponent. Not only that, but it would probably be only with great difficulty that the beaten battery would be able to withdraw its guns into safety. No preponderance of numbers would be of any use, since it is perfectly possible&#x2014;I know the noble and gallant Field-Marshal will bear me out&#x2014;for one effective battery to silence three of its inefficient opponents. Moreover, as the noble Earl, Lord Denbigh, stated, it is questionable whether we require this enormous number of batteries, whether in such enclosed country as this is we would
<col>908</col>
ever be able to find positions for them. We are wasting money, I maintain, on our Territorial Artillery under present conditions, and, what is far more important, we are wasting excellent <i>personnel</i>. We have zealous officers and very keen men, and I am firmly convinced that we could get better value out of them by using them in other arms.<lb/>
I cannot conclude my remarks without referring to the criticisms of the Territorial Force by the German officer, Colonel G&#x00E4;dke, a summary of which appeared in most of the daily papers towards the end of last September. He thought that of the three arms the Artillery was the best, and he mentioned that the shooting left nothing to be desired. I have been at considerable pains to discover what practice this particular colonel attended, and I have been unable to learn that he attended any last year; hut taking for granted that he did, if His Majesty's Government are prepared to place any value, which I am not, on his favourable remarks, they must put an equal value upon the unfavourable remarks which he made on the troops of the Regular Army which took part in the man&#x0153;uvres. One would be almost inclined to think that Colonel G&#x00E3;dke wishes us to give up our Regular Army and to rely entirely on our Territorials.<lb/>
There is one other quotation I should like to make before I sit down. I should like to quote to your Lordships the opinion of an officer who was not long ago one of our most gallant opponents but who is now one of His Majesty's most loyal subjects. General Smuts described what should be the military policy of South Africa at Pretoria on August 10 last year, and a month ago, in the Union Parliament in Cape Colony, he used these words in describing the military policy&#x2014;
<quote>"The country did not want a large Army, but the training of citizens in a manner similar to the Swiss system with a small nucleus of a striking force which could be mobilised at a moment's notice, with a permanent corps of instructors and a permanent Artillery service."</quote>
He has learned a lesson which I hope His Majesty's Government will follow. I will not say more, except to again join in supporting the noble and gallant Field-Marshal in the Motion which he has moved. I view with considerable concern the continued tendency of His Majesty's Government to rely on these untrained batteries for service, and in saying so I believe I express the opinion of a vast
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0480"/>
<col>909</col>
majority of the officers who are best able to judge in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01781"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War alluded to Lord St. Vincent having said that if an invasion of this country took place the invaders would not come by sea. But that was at a time when our superiority at sea was acknowledged on all sides, and we had many more ships and far better officers and men than the French, the French Navy, whose officers were nearly all Royalists, having been ruined by the Revolution. If Villeneuve had beaten Nelson, he would have had to win two more battles with his damaged fleet before he could have protected the landing of a French army in England. There are undoubtedly great difficulties connected with invasion, but they have been much exaggerated. It is often assumed that as much tonnage per man is required for a North Sea voyage as for one to the Cape. For instance, the noble Viscount, in his introduction to the booklet on "Compulsory Service" recently published by General Sir Ian Hamilton, quotes as an authority a most misleading article that appeared in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> in February, 1909, signed "Master Mariner.' The writer assumes that an invader would bring with him. 14,000 horses and any number of transport wagons. I think it unlikely that our enemy would be such an utter fool as to take the trouble to bring with him anything that he could obtain with greater facility by commandeering. "Master Mariner" can never have studied the campaigns of Wallenstein, of Napoleon, or other Generals, or he would know that there is such a thing as living on the country, and making war support war wherever the population is sufficiently dense.<lb/>
An invader might be expected to bring with him guns and harness for his Artillery, saddlery for his Cavalry, bicycles for his Scouts, and plenty of ammunition. His troops could carry three days' rations on their backs, and rely on England to provide them with food, horses, carts, and wagons. With the help of various printed documents any intelligent soldier would know on what farms to find them. They would soon be as well horsed as our Territorials were at man&#x0153;uvres. An enemy would not attempt to bring horses and wagons unless he had full command of the sea, or had already seized a harbour. The noble Viscount's
<col>910</col>
"Master Mariner" allows 200,000 tons of shipping to carry 70,000 men. That is about three tons per man. Now one ton per man, and room to lie down, is all that is required by our own Board of Trade Regulations for vessels carrying passengers to ports between Brest and Hamburg; and one ton per man is quite enough for troops coming from ports between Jutland and Brest. Being under discipline, soldiers would not crowd up and inconvenience one another as much as independent tourists would. Why a soldier should be expected to require treble the tonnage of an ordinary passenger to carry him is one of those things that I do not understand. The weight of the necessary ammunition, harness, and field pieces would be scarcely enough to ballast the ships. The requirements of a Horse Artillery Battery, without horses, amount to about thirty-five tons. Until they had captured horses, the gunners could use drag ropes, as sailors do, and take up positions to protect the disembarkation as soon as they were landed.<lb/>
" Master Mariner calculates that 150 ships are to carry 70,000 men, which works out at 470 per ship. Why, we did better than that in the Crimean War. Some ships took 1,000 men from England to the Crimea. I myself came home from the Crimea in a ship with about 900 men on board besides her crew. There are many German ships capable of carrying 4,000 or 5,000 men for a short voyage. Allowing 2,000 men per ship, only thirty-six ships would be required to carry 70,000 men. If 3,000 men are taken as an average, then only twenty-four ships would be required instead of 150. "Master Mariner" talks about the convoy of ships covering at least twenty miles from van to rear. The length of a column of thirty-six ships at three cables distance, in three columns, would be under four miles, of twenty-four ships about three miles. He then goes on to talk about three weeks elapsing from the first move in the game to the day on which the invading army would be ready to advance inland. This last sentence appears to be too much even for the noble Viscount, for in a note he says that it must not be assumed that the General Staff adopts this conclusion as the basis of its preparations. If it had done so, I should consider that the General Staff had gone mad. But if the General Staff are not in agreement with "Master Mariner" why did the noble Viscount quote such a misleading authority? I should like to know where "Master Mariner" gained
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0481"/>
<col>911</col>
his experience. I doubt if lie has seen much of short voyages with troops in times of pressure. Certainly he has never studied the German mobilisation of 1870, and he evidently knows nothing of the greater rapidity with which German troops can now be assembled.<lb/>
Besides many other experiences of the same kind, I have served as second in command of two different troopships, and have been responsible for the details connected with the embarkation and disembarkation of thousands of troops under most varied conditions as regards climates, landing places, anchorages, and weather. I have also been present at the embarkation of troops belonging to foreign. Powers. I wonder if the Vikings and other hardy Norsemen allowed more than one ton to a man in the time of King Alfred and the other Saxon Monarchs? Many of those who believe an invasion impossible talk of the necessity of assembling armies in one place, near one harbour for embarkation, as Napoleon did at Boulogne, before railways, steamers and telegraph wires were thought of. They forget that few Continental barracks are more than five miles from a railway, and that there are at least a dozen places from which troops can be embarked between Emden and the Frisian Islands. If we can send a hundred thousand undisciplined men to a racecourse and back in a day, how much easier it must be to handle a disciplined crowd of the same number. There need be no accumulation of troops until the troopships meet at sea at a pre-arranged point. An invader's armies are by no means likely to land all in one place, but would try several places, at some of which they might not be completely successful. Harold Hardrada's failure was the chief cause of William the Conqueror's success. Had there been no battle of Stamford Bridge, we should have won the battle of Hastings. If the enemy run their troopships on shore, it will not be possible to sink them with torpedoes. Submarines will then be harmless, the troops would be safe from being drowned, and the hull of the ship would serve as a breakwater for landing the men in boats. If we were beaten, England would have to pay for the ships. Now the difficulty of bringing over an invading army increases at a greater ratio than its numerical proportion. I consider that it is four times as difficult to bring over 50,000 men as it is to bring over 25,000. So that if we are able to beat a
<col>912</col>
fairly large army it will never attempt to come until our naval powers of resistance have been destroyed or temporarily interfered with.<lb/>
On this question of the possibility of invasion naval opinion is divided. The present system under which very few officers on the Active List express their opinions and retired officers who write or speak are denounced by a portion of the Press as holding obsolete opinions is one I that I consider to be fraught with danger to the country. Senior Naval Lords ought certainly to be unmuzzled. Naval Lords may not ask it for themselves, and personally it may be inconvenient for them that they should be, but it would certainly be to the advantage of the country. They ought to be <i>ex-officio</i> Peers, and retain their Peerages for life after having been Senior Naval Lords for one year. Of course the Senior Naval Lord could not be expected to attend this House regularly or to take part in public affairs unconnected with the Navy, but he could attend whenever naval questions came on, and he should while holding office, sit on the Cross Benches. I must say that I wish Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson had a seat in this House on those Cross Benches so as to be able to explain to us the full meaning of the Memorandum that has been recently published by the noble Viscount. Sir Arthur Wilson's Memorandum concludes by saying that an enemy would probably decide, as the Admiralty have done, that an invasion on even the moderate scale of 70,000 men would be practically impossible. On October 10, 1903, similar assurances were given by the Chief of the Russian Naval Staff to their own military authorities. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"So long as our Fleet is not destroyed, the operations named are absolutely impossible."</quote>
Yet four months after, the Japanese armies were landing wherever they chose, regardless of a Fleet still in being. Let us hope that history will not repeat itself.<lb/>
I take Sir Arthur Wilson's Memorandum as meaning that we require a standard of two and a-half keels to one as compared with any Continental Power if we are to be absolutely certain of being able to stop invasion and protect our commerce, and shall give my reasons for doing so. Two years ago I moved for a Return of the number of days in a year that our newer battleships and cruisers were in dockyard hands. The average is over three months.
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0482"/>
<col>913</col>
So that you require twelve ships on our coasts to meet nine of the enemy's if you wish always to be able to meet him with equal numbers. For the weaker Power can choose the day for his sortie, leaving the stronger Power in command of the sea until the day that all his ships are ready, the day in question remaining a State secret. We ought, therefore, always to be prepared to accept his challenge on any day he may select. This gives the weaker Power an immense advantage. We should recollect that there are two exits from the North Sea, one through the Channel and another round Scotland, and that the close blockade of a shallow coast, suitable for the employment of mines, is not practicable. Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson talks about the possibility of an enemy drawing off half our Fleet. That assumes that the Admiral in command of one half of our Fleet believes himself to be strong enough to beat the whole of the enemy's Fleet if he can catch it, and that the other half of our Fleet is strong enough to beat him also if he attempts to return. Taking into consideration the ships in dockyard hands that will not be able to take a part in the contest, we should require at least a two and a-half keel to one standard if we are to be absolutely certain of being able to do this. Students of German naval literature know that schemes for dropping mines at the entrances of the naval harbours of Great Britain before this country is aware that hostilities have commenced have been worked out in detail. It will take some days to clear away these mines, and that will be the opportunity of the invader. It is true that we may go to sleep in our beds, but we may wake up some fine morning and find our harbours blocked, and our big ships unable to come out. I have seen it stated in the Press that between 1908 and 1911 we have spent &#x00A3;34,500,000 on new construction, as against &#x00A3;29,500,000 spent by Germany. This will not give us a two keel to one standard, as Germany builds almost as cheaply as we do.<lb/>
Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson commences by stating that the danger of interruption of our trade and destruction of our merchant shipping is more to be feared than an invasion. There I agree with him. But if our Fleets are to be always in the North Sea because we have no Home Army, how is our trade on the high seas to be protected against the fast armed merchant-ships that will start up from the distant seas to prey upon our commerce? Every one of our
<col>914</col>
enemy's converted traders ought to have a man-of-war of greater power and greater speed in chase of her, shepherding her as the phrase is; and if the greater part of our ships and men are to be kept near our coasts, how can this be done?<lb/>
The German Government are utilising their own Socialists by permitting them, nay encouraging them, to mislead their British comrades by inculcating a belief among them that they arc strong enough to prevent war, and thereby enabling our Socialists to preach that it is unnecessary for England to be prepared for eventualities. Our political Parties in these islands are unfortunately so balanced that it may be possible for the Keir Hardies to prevent our preparations from being made in time. But the German Socialists are but a fly on the wheel of the German Government, and will no more influence its proceedings than they did those of Bismarck in 1866. Few wars have been more unpopular than that of 1866 in Prussia, yet every man marched and fought well when the order was given. On peace being made the people forgave their Government because it had been successful. It is no new thing fog the German Government to utilise their Socialists. I recollect a speech of Bismarck' 3, who, when called to task for having in his younger days entered into a political flirtation with Lasalle, declared that he and Lasalle had many points of agreement, one of them being that Lasalle was in favour of German unity. "The chief difference between them," he said, "was that when unity was once established Lasalle would have preferred a Lasalle dynasty, whereas he (Bismarck) was satisfied with that of the Hohenzollerns." lie had utilised Lasalle, just as the German Government are utilising their own Socialists and ours. Mr. Keir Hardie and his supporters are mere puppets dancing on strings pulled by the German Government.<lb/>
Not long ago I received a circular, described as a "Notable Pronouncement," signed by a number of labour leaders who objected to universal service. I should recommend them and their co-signatories to read a work recently published in the United States called "The Valour of Ignorance." They will then have a better understanding of the problems they attempt to deal with in such a light-hearted and optimistic manner. The cost of universal service will be largely, if not completely, recouped by the habits of punctuality and exactitude that will be taught to the men
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0483"/>
<col>915</col>
in their early youth. Universal service would also provide us with officers. Men who objected to serving in the ranks would make themselves efficient as officers, learning their work as cadets, largely at their own expense. After 1870, substitutes were abolished in the French Army, and in consequence it is much better officered than it used to be.<lb/>
I honour the Territorials for coming forward to learn what they can under the present system. But to rely on volunteering alone for a Home Army, is, I think, most unfair on the Territorials. Why should they alone pay in their own person the tax for self-defence? The whole country benefits by it. Try a volunteer Income Tax. Let those pay who choose to do so. How much would the Chancellor of the Exchequer get? No heroism that is too late can save the situation. This country can never be in the position of Spain a century ago. A thinly-populated, mountainous country may defeat a more powerful enemy by pertinacity and heroism, but in England there would be nothing left
<col>916</col>
to do but to sit down and starve if once a foreigner could land and seize our chief railways, or interfere with our food supplies at sea. Every man who is physically fit to serve ought to have some place in the arrangements for the defence of the liberties won by our ancestors. Every able-bodied man ought to have his station, just as in the case of a ship when the fire-bell rings. I hope the noble and gallant Field-Marshal will continue his campaign in the education of the people on this matter. I think opinion is growing, and I hope it will grow still more and that before my lifetime is out public opinion will enable the occupants of both Front Benches to take up this question prior to the disaster which we are told must happen before the question is effectually dealt with.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01797">Debate on the Motion of the Earl Roberts to resolve, That, in view of the altered strategic conditions in Europe, this House views with grave and growing concern the inadequate military arrangements of His Majesty's Government for the defence of this country and of His Majesty's Oversea Dominions; <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01798"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is not the first of the discussions on the general military situation of the country into which we have been drawn in the course of the last two or three years, and I confess I should have deprecated a further reiteration of facts which are already so well known if it were not that I think the situation with which we have to deal becomes yearly more acute and the public becomes more apathetic as to the condition of our military affairs. But if justification were necessary for specially pressing this question in the very strong and impressive language used by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal last night, I think it is shown in the speech in which the Secretary of State replied. I confess that that speech was to me, as I believe it was to many members of this House, a profound disappointment.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0485"/>
<col>919</col>
What was the position? We had had an indictment, drawn on the highest authority, going through the whole circumstances of the numbers, the training, and the quality of our troops left at home for the defence of the kingdom, and also a fair and reasoned estimate of the possible source of attack. That was the case as it stood when the Minister for War rose to reply. What did we hear in reply? We were met with absolutely no challenge of the figures; we were met with some question as to the quality; we were, I think, not reassured at all on the training; but, unfortunately, the greater part of the noble Viscount's speech was devoted to a number of generalities which had absolutely no bearing, I submit, on the speech which was under reply, and a number of details were dragged into the discussion, details which had never been challenged, of proposals which had never been made, and a coloured presentment of a case to which the noble Viscount had never been asked to reply was put before your Lordships, much in the same way as in legal circles they say "No case; abuse the plaintiff's attorney." I should like to made good those statements.<lb/>
In the first place, the noble Viscount went back to Von Moltke, and referred to Von Moltke's answer when asked whether Prussia was organised to meet France, Austria, and Russia combined&#x2014;"We must defend ourselves as best we can." But that was not the sort of case which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal put last night. The question is whether, after you have sent your organised Army abroad in answer to a call from a distant part of the Empire, you are in a position to defend this country against any attack which may be reasonably expected at home. In the same spirit the noble Viscount discussed an alternative which he drew from a book, inspired, no doubt, by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, but from a part of it which was not written by the noble Earl, and he compared the proposed force of 300,000 men having a year's training with our present Expeditionary Force, trained for a minimum of three years. But the point of Lord Roberts's observations lay in the comparison of the force which had had a year's training with a Territorial Army which only had a fortnight's training. The noble Viscount forced an open door, and so gained an easy victory. It is just that which makes me speak of his speech as a succession of <i>non sequiturs</i> and consequently a great
<col>920</col>
disappointment to us, who had hoped to hear this great question dealt with, not by debating points and a soothing pronouncement, but by a broad view of our responsibilities.<lb/>
In the same way I confess I grudge the time out of the noble Viscount's speech which was devoted to the proposition that there might be circumstances in which a blow struck in Europe would neutralise a possible attack on these islands. I will not say that is a far-fetched theory. I will not say that there are no circumstances under which it may be necessary for us at some time or another to act as a make-weight on the Continent. But I do venture to say that we should limit the discussion of this Motion to the words of the Motion. The whole question before us to-day is whether the troops we have left at home and the Army generally are adequate for the defence of His Majesty's Dominions here and overseas. There is no question before us of landing a large force on the Continent to take a hand in Continental affairs. There is no question of landing 300,000 men in Belgium. Difficult as it is at this moment to persuade anybody of our danger or to make the necessary sacrifices, it would be infinitely harder if the public were persuaded to read into the policy of the noble and gallant Earl a determination that we should attempt to rival Continental armies or turn that which is only asked for to defend our shores into a large offensive object. I deprecate strongly on the one side the ambitious proposals of those who would inspire a policy for which the nation is not prepared to make the necessary sacrifices, and I deprecate on the other the too confident reassuring statements by which the nation is encouraged to believe that no extra sacrifice is entailed upon it in order to maintain the integrity of our own Dominions against very highly organised neighbours, some of whom are also acquisitive neighbours.<lb/>
I am sure there has not been anything of Party controversy introduced into this debate up to now. I would propose only to argue this case by contrasting the proposals of the noble Viscount, made after due examination of our position, with that which he has been able to achieve after an uninterrupted period of office of five years. The noble Viscount has stood, and stands now, in an almost peculiar position. He has been Secretary of State for War longer than
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0486"/>
<col>921</col>
any man in the last fifty years&#x2014;I am not sure that I might not say in the last one hundred years. During that period he has not had his hands hampered by providing even for small wars. He has enjoyed the absolute loyalty of his colleagues, the sympathy of the public, and the unstinted support of his political opponents in carrying out his policy. He has been perfectly clear as to where he was going and what he wanted to do. He knows that inside this House there is not only no difference from him on the ground of Party, but there is no difference on the ground of policy as regards what he aimed at when he took office. We might object to his methods, but oil general policy we were at one with him. It is not too much, I think, to ask that I should be allowed to state what it was he aimed at and what it is he has achieved, and at the end I believe you will come to this conclusion. If such a man, with such a backing, still leaves grave gaps in our defences and is forced to fall hack on the vague assertion that in case of emergency we must defend ourselves as best we can, we must come to the conclusion that the problem is insoluble under present conditions, or we must ask why, if the noble Viscount wants to obtain an equipoise between his aspirations and his actions, it is not he instead of Lord Roberts who is moving this Motion and asking your Lordships to accompany us into the Lobby into which we must go to-night.<lb/>
In 1906 the noble Viscount paid a tribute to the Army. He said that the Army was in a condition it had never been in before, both in quantity and quality; but lie said that it was too costly and he hoped to reduce its cost. I am averse to troubling your Lordships with figures, but I have prepared sonic figures on this subject, and I hope I may be allowed to cite them. The cost of the Army when the noble Viscount took it over was about &#x00A3; 28,500,000, but to that may be added some capital expenditure out of loans on barracks. What is the present state of the Estimates? They are &#x00A3; 1,000,000 less, but they provide for 74,000 fewer troops than they did five years ago. If those 74,000 troops according to their relative cost were still on the Estimates the cost would be about&#x2014;2,000,000. Therefore the sum of&#x2014;1,000,000 has been saved&#x2014;whtether well or not I will leave your Lordships to consider&#x2014;and &#x00A3;1,000,000 has been spent. The sum of &#x00A3;1,000,000 has been taken off the Regular Army and added to the Territorial Army. The cost of the Volun-
<col>922</col>
teers was about &#x00A3;7 10s. per head; the cost of the Territorials is half as much a: fain. The cost of a Militiaman was &#x00A3;22; the cost of a Special Reservist is &#x00A3;28. It is easy for any soldier to decide, even if the advantage of the Special Reservist is greater than the Militia, whether the improvement in the Territorial Army justifies the cost having been raised by fifty per cent. But in any case this Army, which was too costly, has had to give up a large number&#x2014;Lord Roberts stated last night 30,000 men&#x2014;in order to supply this deficit in the home force. I will ask presently whether that home force has been made adequate to our needs by this great sacrifice of the Regular Army.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said that there were gaps to be made up and superfluities to be knocked off, that we were wanting in proper training, that he was going to place us on two lines instead. of three, that we lacked the power of expansion, and he said he proposed, and he has since endeavoured, to meet all these difficulties. With regard to superfluities, the noble Viscount said he would provide what was necessary and lop off what was unnecessary. He has lopped off one battalion of Guards&#x2014;the finest troops in the Army&#x2014;eight battalions of the Line, and eighty men of each of the home battalions. He will not know what he has lost, in those eight battalions of the Line unless lie finds himself in the position which Lord Lansdowne occupied at the beginning of the South African war, when almost his last battalion of the Line had had to be sent abroad. He has already found what it was to knock off eighty men from each of the hone battalions, because he has this year had to send extra men to battalions unable to supply the regiments abroad because the establishment had been reduced too low. Then, again, there was a proposal to reduce the Artillery. I am not going to trouble your Lordships by going into that to-night. It has been most vigorously protested against in this House, and if these debates have done nothing else they have done one great thing in that they have forced the Government to recognise that this proposed reduction in Artillery must be given up. The reduction has been given up, and I will only say that there is much joy in this House in consequence.<lb/>
Then take the question of gaps. After five years there are certain gaps which we
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0487"/>
<col>923</col>
might have hoped to see filled up. Take the question of officers. I admit that when the late Government left office we had not solved to the full the question of obtaining sufficient officers for our home troops. But has the noble Viscount solved it? When we left office five years ago there were 10,788 Regular officers. There are now, according to the latest returns, 10,705. I regret to find that it is impossible at present to obtain candidates for Sandhurst and Woolwich without greatly lowering the standard, and I cannot help feeling, in a day of almost universal progress with regard to payments, that the time has come when you must pay officers more. The Militia five years ago had 2,450 officers; the Special Reserve has to-day 1,840, and is short of its numbers by 1,167, according to the latest figures given to the public. The Territorial Army, despite all the efforts of Lords-Lieutenant and County Associations, has 9,7:50 officers, or 1,500 short of its strength. You cannot say that a Regular Army which is barely officered, a Regular Army which has not got a Reserve which will enable it to mobilise the Expeditionary Force without drawing on the officers who are attached to the Special Reserve at home, and which, therefore, has to absorb for the Expeditionary Force all those officers who were expected to remain here to give a nucleus to the home defence force&#x2014;you cannot say that that Regular Army is more than supplied, and you find the Special Reserve short of 1,100 officers and the Territorial Force short of 1,500 officers. Surely I have made my point that the noble Viscount has not by his voluntary system been able to supply us with the all-important substratum of our military strength&#x2014;a proper number of officers. I say nothing&#x2014;Rome was not built in a day&#x2014;about transport for the home Army; I say nothing about horses; I say nothing on this occasion about stores, though the return of stores has given some of us who have served in the War Office great anxiety. But I do submit that, great as have been the exertions of the noble Viscount, if he were to leave office to-morrow and an impartial critic were to take his place, the impartial critic would say that he had to clothe the skeleton of the noble Viscount's scheme in order to give it flesh and blood and reality for action in the field.<lb/>
Then we were told we should have a power of expansion of the Regular Army.<lb/>
<col>924</col>
The Secretary of State has on several occasions told the country that the Regular Army was 90,000 stronger in the five years since he took office. He added what he hoped he would get in the Special Reserve to the Army Reserve which now exists, but which by his admission will be diminished in a few years, and he made out a figure of 90,000, which I have often invited him to substantiate. The real number is not 90,000 but 20,000. It is quite true that by taking 65,000 of the Special Reserve, men trained for six months and then for three weeks a year, and adding them to his Army reduced by 20,000 and his Reserve reduced by between 10,000 and 20,000, he gets an increase of a little over 20,000 men who are liable to go abroad and support the Regular Army on an emergency. I do not wish to say a word against the Special Reserve, but read the noble Viscount's own aspiration in 1907. He objected to the Militia, which he was about to do away with, on the ground that many battalions enlisted youths of only seventeen years of age who could not be taken into the Line and would he useless for war. But does the noble Viscount cease to enlist these youths? They are enlisted now at the age of seventeen for the Special Reserve, and those very boys who he said were useless for war when in the Militia are now placed on the roll of the Army Reserve to support the Regular Army in the tropics. Yet the supporters of the noble Viscount have twitted us that he, with a reduction of &#x00A3;1,000,000 in the Army Estimates, has been able to add to our striking force.<lb/>
Next I come to the question of training. We were to have boys trained at the schools&#x2014;a most desirable plan, but a plan that was abandoned on the first trumpet call of the Labour Party in another place. I cannot understand how any man who has the interests of the country at heart can surrender to those who are not anxious for defence when training of that kind is so necessary. Next the men were to be better trained and longer trained. It has been found impossible to force the whole of the Territorial Army to the longer training. Officers were also to be trained quite differently from the Militia officers. In a. Memorandum issued a fortnight ago to officers of the Special Reserve battalions the Secretary of State for War mentions the large deficiency of subalterns, and proceeds&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0488"/>
<col>925</col>
<quote>"There is reason to think that one of the principal obstacles experienced by candidates is the length of the period of probationary training, twelve months. While that period cannot be considered longer than is desirable for the training of an officer at the present day, it is useless to maintain a standard which experience has shown to be prohibitive. It has, therefore, been decided to reduce the period of twelve months for Infantry Officers to six months."</quote>
Can your Lordships have a stronger proof than that that, with the best will in the world, the standards laid down by the noble Viscount himself cannot be maintained, and that you are asked to accept officers with much less than the minimum training originally laid down because they are not to be obtained otherwise. Last night the noble Viscount disclaimed the statement attributed to him that he had at one time the idea of a Territorial Force of 900,000 men. That idea had been current in the country for a long time before the noble Viscount thought it necessary to dissociate himself from it.</membercontribution></p>

<col>926</col>
now available to keep up our fighting force abroad is very much the same as before, because the noble Viscount has brought home a good many regiments from South Africa and elsewhere which before were not so available. But the point is, what remains at home? A nucleus of 20,000, 30,000, or 40,000 organised Regular troops may not seem a large number, but they mean forty regiments of infantry, which in a force largely composed of partially trained troops supply exactly that nucleus on which every commander has insisted. That nucleus has been cut away. What remains behind? The noble Duke on the Back Bench (the Duke of Bedford) had intended, and I hope still intends, to show what is the value of the various units remaining behind, and the number of men attached to no unit at all. But I am not going beyond the truth when I say that those units must be hastily put together, that they have no cohesion, that they will have no, or very few, Regular officers, and that they will be milked for drafts. Therefore you have to depend almost exclusively for home defence on the Territorial Army.<lb/>
Testimony was given last night to the increased value of the Territorial Army. I believe the noble Viscount was fully justified in claiming that the organisation of the Territorial Army has greatly improved, and I think we should be wanting in gratitude to both officers and men and also to those who have helped in the organisation if we did not acknowledge the patriotism and self-sacrifice with which a large number of individuals who could ill afford the time have endeavoured to fit themselves for duty. Having said that, I hope I may be pardoned if I do not reiterate another word of compliment to the Territorial Force. I ant going upon facts, and when we are asked in the face of military opinion to accept this Force without backing or stiffening of Regulars to meet a possible invasion by a force of 70,000 trained men, I think we are entitled to ask what really is the value of the Force upon the bare facts. I deeply regret that in the part of his speech dealing with this matter the noble Viscount misled us last night. He quoted in defence of his view the words of Colonel Repington that the Territorial Force might in a majority of three to one encounter picked Continental troops, and that after six months training they might encounter Continental troops
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0489"/>
<col>927</col>
in the majority of two to one. But here he stopped. Why did the noble Viscount not proceed to give Colonel Repington's opinion of the value of the Force as a whole, not the relative value. On December 10 last Colonel Repington gave that opinion, and I will read it, He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Is the Territorial Force ready to undertake this great and responsible mission'? "&#x2014;</quote>
that is, of home defence&#x2014;
<quote>"It is easy to explain why the Force is not yet ready for war. Numbers are not yet made up, and establishments if filled are insufficient. The training, though almost as good in the Midlands as it could be made with a fifteen-day camp, is not up to the standard that war requires. The mobilisation stores and First Line transport are not complete. Your mission in war may not be bootless, but fear that some of your men will be&#x2026; Horses, wagons, and motor-lorries you will have to whistle for until the census and classification arc everywhere in force. Finally, the Force is not suited to long embodiment under arms."</quote>
That is the testimony of the officer who was cited to us last night by the noble Viscount to confound Lord Roberts as to the value of the Territorial Force for the defence of the country.<lb/>
Giving every credit that can be given to the Force, when out of 265,000 men there are 134,000 with a period of service under two years, when 83,000 are under twenty years of age, when 100,000 did not fire their musketry course last year, when 24,000 were unable to attend camp, and when the Force is short of 1,500 officers, am I not justified in saying that this is a rather rickety parapet for the edge of an abyss at the bottom of which is our absolute destruction as a first-class Power. I sometimes fear when I think of the 30,000 Regulars cut off to make improvements in the Territorial Force, that the noble Viscount may have exchanged susbtance for shadow. Possible invasion by a force of 70,000 men has been spoken of, but two steamers&#x2014;and there is one now building&#x2014;might carry the 70,000 up to 100,000. I suggest that there is no finality in this matter. We are not dealing with an exact science, and I hardly think that in those circumstances it is fair for the noble Viscount to say, as he did last night, that he may exclude from consideration such an invasion in the handling of practical affairs. If that be so, why all this paraphernalia of County Associations, Territorial man&#x0153;uvres and all that is being done in order to try and bring the Force up to the necessary standard '? The noble Viscount told us that
<col>928</col>
we might just as much exclude this as a noble Lord would exclude the risk of being run over by a motor car. I would put it differently. I would say that no one if he were crippled and unable, as other men, to hold his own, would be wise to venture into the middle of crowded traffic; and the men you would put into the field would have to meet men of the first class.<lb/>
When I heard the beginning of this debate I wondered by what military opinion the present position would be supported. It is remarkable that, with the unexampled array of high military authorities this House supplies, the views of the noble Viscount have not received military support. We have five Field-Marshals in this House. One has spoken already. Lord Grenfell on a previous occasion supported every word said by Lord Roberts. Does any one doubt that if that illustrious Field-Marshal who was Inspector-General of the Forces for three years were able to support the view which is taken by the Government he would be absent to-night and unwilling to rise in his place to reassure us? Can any one doubt that if Lord Kitchener, a member of the Defence Committee, were in sympathy with the policy of the noble Viscount, that if he were able to say "ditto" to Sir Ian Hamilton, he would not be encouraged to be in his place also to reassure us? I listened to speech after speech last night by men who have served in every category of our Forces, and in not one of them did I hear that the Force on which such great reliance is placed was fit for the task to be entrusted to it. The noble Viscount himself, in a speech which will never be forgotten, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I think we can dismiss from our minds all notion of organising ourselves voluntarily up to the war standard in time of peace&#x2014;all notion of playing at soldiers which we shall never be&#x2014;and spend the money&#x2014;in organising ourselves in skeleton."</quote>
I want to know by what military authorities that view is supported. I venture to say that it is not an undue demand to make that some military authority, utterly unbiassed by politics and entirely uncommitted to any of these schemes, should be allowed to examine the state of the Forces of this country after the main Army has embarked, and tell us whether the state of those Forces is adequate to the danger which His Majesty's Government admit they may have to face. Until we have some pronouncement of that kind from an independent authority we cannot be censured if we feel that the views expressed are not the views
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0490"/>
<col>929</col>
of the Army but the views of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
I for one deeply regret that the office of Commander-in-Chief was ever abolished. If I had realised that the results of Lord Esher's Committee&#x2014;the determination to establish a board on the principle of the Board of Admiralty&#x2014;would have had the effect of condemning to complete silence all the soldiers whose opinions we had most right to hear, and whose opinions have, been voiced from the Front Cross Bench in your Lordships' House for fifty years by successive Commanders-in-Chief, I confess I would sooner have resigned my office than have been a party to placing the Army in the position it has been for the past five years. W can never get from the Government now a vestige of idea whether the opinions they express and the proposals they put forward are backed by the military authorities or not. We are sometimes twitted with not having a scheme of our own. It is not the business of the Opposition to put forward a scheme. Amateurs or professional soldiers who are not themselves responsible are heard with great respect, but, of course, it is on the military advisers of the Government that the responsibility falls, and those are the very men whose opinions in the mass we are never allowed to hear.<lb/>
I make one appeal to the noble Viscount before I sit down. I thought that his speech last night was too much on the line of special pleading, and that it dealt too little with the deficiences and defects which he himself would be the first to acknowledge. I remember his Bill of 1907 being before your Lordships' House. After long discussion in the House of Commons questions in that Bill were debated here with absolute freedom from Party and with a determination to get at the truth; concession after concession was induced from the Government, and the measure finally left this House a very different measure from the one that came here. Will the noble Viscount tell me whether he has ever felt cause to regret any single one of those concessions? 1 ask him to regard the opinions expressed in this debate from the same standpoint. What we are asked to do is to acquiesce in a state of affairs which no other country in the world which has any care for its defence has ever agreed to. We are the only nation in the world which, with all the lessons we have received in the past and all
<col>930</col>
the mistakes made in military strategy in South Africa, is encouraged to accept naval opinion as though it were absolutely final and conclusive on every detail in a science which cannot be an exact science, and in which we are gambling absolutely with the very life and existence of the nation. I know that nothing is more unpopular than to speak out truthfully and with sincerity on these things. My noble friend Lord Milner dealt with this point last night, and showed that the very step which we are assured by the Government would cripple the Navy would actually set the Navy free for its operations. While other nations cease their military preparations on the day war begins, we are the only nation whose main preparation is not to begin until the first gun has been fired. Great nations in the past have come to grief because they believed they could rot ask their democracy to make sacrifices which were really necessary. If with this record of facts before us, and with the knowledge of the constant endeavour and high purpose which have stimulated the War Office during the last five years, we see results which no soldier can look at and justify; if we sit down and accept the impotent conclusion that we can do no more and must defend ourselves as best we can, then I say His Majesty's Government and the country must absolve those who sit on this side of the House from any share of responsibility for a want of preparedness which we have clearly foreseen and pointed out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01806"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to follow the noble Viscount very far into the realm of figures. We have had a great many discussions on figures, and I have to the best of my ability opposed the figures he has offered with figures which I believed, obtained as they had been from the best sources, to be strictly accurate. First of all the noble Viscount accused my noble friend of having reduced the strength of the Infantry because he reduced its establishment shortly after he came into office. He did reduce the establishment, but my noble friend was very far when he did that from reducing its strength. He was simply bringing the establishment into some sort of accord with the strength. The noble Viscount opposite accuses us of having made reductions in Artillery. No reductions were made in the Artillery. Then he made a comparison between our military position in 1905 and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0491"/>
<col>931</col>
the position as it was last year. On that I would point out that the position in 1905 was imaginary in so far as the strength on mobilisation depended almost entirely upon a Reserve which never existed. When he says we have reduced the fighting strength of the Army I would like to put before your Lordships what the actual position was when my noble friend took office.<lb/>
We fall into the error, in discussing these matters in this House, of discussing the question, not from the point of view of what the fighting strength is that you can mobilise, but the actual numbers of men that you have in your Army irrespective of what organised force you could form out of them. When my noble friend first took office and worked out the possibility of mobilising an Expeditionary Force of six Divisions he found that there were considerable deficiencies. The noble Viscount opposite has twitted us with the fact_that we are going to call upon the Special Reserve to provide some of the officers required on mobilisation. It may possibly be news to the noble Viscount to know that to have organised a similar Expeditionary Force in 1905 would have required 1,677 officers and 26,147 men of different arms who were not on the peace establishment of the Army. That, I would remind the noble Viscount, was the position for mobilisation of an Expeditionary Force of 160,000 men in the early part of 1906.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01807"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I have had to observe on many occasions that you cannot create an Army in a year or two. You must wait and compare the normal when the men who have enlisted have gone to the Reserve. Our Reserve was then 94,000, and would have been very much larger long before now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01808"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The system organised by the noble Viscount was completely overthrown by his successor long before my noble friend Lord Haldane took office. The position was as I have said. You could not mobilise six Divisions nor go anywhere near mobilising six Divisions. There was a deficiency of officers then, but it is rather less now than then, and there was a very much larger deficiency of men. Allowing that the system of the noble Viscount opposite had been permitted to attain the normal, he could not have mobilised a larger Expeditionary Force in terms of Divisions than is possible now. He might possibly have mobilised six
<col>932</col>
Divisions, but six Divisions was the utmost that could have been mobilised then. We do not deny that reductions have been made in the Regular Army, but we have set ourselves to mobilise an Expeditionary Force of six Divisions, and when the noble Viscount twits us with having made comparatively small saving in expenditure I would only say that the saving would have been considerably more had the holes that he left to be filled up been smaller. After all, a great deal had to be done in order to complete mobilisation arrangements. The Special Reserve in its present form is a far more valuable part of the military system than the old Militia, on which a considerable sum of money had to be expended. An attempt has been made to provide for the known deficiency of officers by the institution of the Officers-Training Corps. Another equally important matter has been the formation of depot machinery for the purpose of training drafts. The result of all this is that at the present moment, in spite of having a slightly smaller Army, we can mobilise just as large a force as would have been possible under the noble Viscount's scheme, and. can maintain it longer in the field than he could ever have done.<lb/>
A great deal of yesterday's debate consisted of complaints as to the details of the present system. Admittedly there are a great many details to be filled in and a great many points that will require attention; but there is one thing which you have to thank for that, and one thing alone, and that is the lack of continuity which has always existed in military affairs. Ever since the attention of the country has been seriously turned to the Army it has been going through a series of the most important and fundamental changes. Principles and details cannot be settled at the same time. My noble friend has done more in the time that he has been at the War Office than I think anybody else. He has settled the principles, and I hope has settled them for a long time to come; but there are, as I have said, a great many details which remain to be settled. It is only when you have got the principles settled that you can work out the innumerable details. Under that head I place the matter of horses and other things of the greatest importance. If the present system is allowed to continue for another five years I venture to say that the great part of those numerous details will have been
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0492"/>
<col>933</col>
settled. We are not offered continuity. Instead of being offered anything like continuity, the Motion before the House, if it were carried into effect, would involve the complete upheaval and destruction of the present system.<lb/>
I confess that in view of what the noble Viscount who has just spoken said I find myself in a certain amount of difficulty. I remember the debate which took place about eighteen months ago in this House on the Motion of Lord Roberts, when about half way through the debate the speakers for the National Service League began to disclaim the documents which had been put forward as being their scheme. I do not know if we may regard the noble Viscount as one of the speakers for the National Service League, but he has certainly disclaimed the scheme which is before the country under the <i>aegis</i> of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal&#x2014;namely, the scheme contained in the book which bears his name. We who lack information to the contrary, and that includes the country at large, are going to continue to consider that the schemes which are laid down in that book are to be regarded as the schemes of the National Service League. The noble Viscount declared that it was not the business of the Opposition to produce a scheme. Our complaint is not that they have not produced a scheme, but that they have produced too many schemes in the last few years. The noble Viscount, it is true, did not produce a scheme, and I confess that as I listened to his speech I was puzzled to know whether he favours the scheme advocated by the National Service League. I think that we have every reason to consider that we are entitled under the very wide terms of the Motion before the House to discuss the schemes contained in Lord Roberts' book, although there is one part of that book which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal does not accept in its entirety.<lb/>
The scheme which is the constructive part of the book, and which proposes a definite military policy as an alternative to the present organisation of our Regular Army, has taken four or five years, I presume, to produce. The writer of it has suffered no limitation; he has had no Chancellor of the Exchequer to pull him up in the matter of finance, no Adjutant-General to warn him as to the effect of his scheme on recruiting, no one to tell him
<col>934</col>
that the necessary supply of officers was not forthcoming. The writer has been his own General Staff and has laid down his own standard of training. I would like to take that scheme and institute some sort of comparison between it and our present military system. This new proposal would divide the Army into several categories. First, there are the foreign garrisons. They are to consist of men all of whom had enlisted for twenty-one years, and all of whom would be entitled to pensions on leaving the Army. That system of long service foreign garrisons has been tried in this country and deliberately discarded because it was wasteful, costly, and for military purposes inefficient. The fact is, soldiers cannot serve for a long time abroad in tropical climates without deteriorating in fighting qualities and without costing very large sums for invalidity and pensions. There is no soldier who will not say that the Cardwell system gives you better foreign garrisons than this proposal. Therefore in the first category the present system is better than the proposed new one.<lb/>
Then I come to the second category&#x2014;the Expeditionary Force. With all deference to the noble Viscount I maintain that the speech of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, and particularly the speech of Lord 'Milner and tilt book itself, all point to the same thing, and all say that this Expeditionary Force is to be used for immediate foreign service on the Continent and elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01809"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Not the Expeditionary Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01810"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes, the Expeditionary Force of 300,000 men. I am quoting from the book. No reason has been given for the selection of that number, and why it should not be 200,000 or 400,000. That Force, which, as I have said, is to be available for immediate foreign service on the Continent or elsewhere, is to depend for its existence upon the small proportion of long service men who happen to be at home, and on obtaining 70,000 recruits each year&#x2014;more than double the number of recruits obtained at present for the Regular Army. In view of what my noble friend the Secretary of State said yesterday as to the impossibility of having a compulsory system and a voluntary system existing side by side, the proposal
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0493"/>
<col>935</col>
to get 70,000 recruits annually must be regarded as in the nature of an extremely dangerous gamble. I believe that every soldier would say that the greater part of the proposed Expeditionary Force would be undertrained for the purpose for which it is intended, and that many would prefer to lead in a campaign 170,000 men of the present Expeditionary Force than 300,000 of the proposed force; and I have no hesitation in saying that if there was the faintest chance of this scheme being carried into effect it would create consternation in the minds of the best soldiers in the British Army at the present time.<lb/>
I pass to the third category&#x2014;the question of home defence. The scheme of the National Service League remains unchanged from what it was about two years ago. At that time we ventured to make certain criticisms upon it based on the opinions of experts, the principal one of which was that for the purpose for which it was intended&#x2014;namely, to encounter a large invading force of Continental troops at very short notice&#x2014;it was not suitable, for the reason that, first of all, the force would never have sufficient embodied training, and, secondly, that no measures were indicated whatever for the provision and training of officers. I do not think that the National Service League have made any reply. They certainly did not at the time. We see no proposals on their part to improve the home defence force in any respect. Fortunately, however, both for the National Service League and for us the problem of invasion is not as they have stated it. We have had reason, I know, to deplore the fact that when we have been discussing this very important question in this House we have not had at our disposal expert naval opinion. That, I am glad to say, is not the case at the present moment. Now we have expert naval opinion on the question of invasion crystallised in the recently published Admiralty Memorandum on the Navy, and I think it is a significant fact that not a single speaker on behalf of the National Service League has made the faintest attempt to criticise or try to refute the principles of home defence laid down in that Memorandum.<lb/>
There has been a good deal of comment upon the details of the Memorandum. Everybody who has mentioned this Memorandum seems to have skipped the first three paragraphs. The points which are
<col>936</col>
germane to this particular question are quite short. I will read them. The Memorandum begins&#x2014;
<quote>"The really serious danger that this country has to guard against in war is not invasion but interruption of our trade and destruction of our merchant shipping."</quote>
And it goes on in the third paragraph to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The main object aimed at by our Fleet, whether for the defence of commerce or for any other purpose, is to prevent any ship of the enemy from getting to sea far enough to do any mischief before she is brought to action."</quote>
My Lords, that is the naval position on this question. What does it mean? It means that the defence of this country is not what it is described to be by the various speakers on the subject as tying the hands and destroying the initiative of the Navy, but that it is an incident in the first and paramount duty of the Navy which is to keep open the trade routes for the supply of food to this country. Just as the part is less than the whole, so is the defence of these coasts less than the task of the necessary command of the sea for the purpose of keeping clear our trade routes. If the Navy cannot do that; if the Navy is unable, in the words I have quoted, to prevent the enemy's fleet from getting to sea far enough to do any mischief before being brought to action, which is necessary to prevent invasion, how is it going to be possible for them to keep open the trade routes for the food supply of this country? If the Navy is unable to carry out that part of their task, of what use is one million, two million, or three million bayonets in this country? You may make invasion impossible, but if you let the enemy's Navy out, invasion is no longer a necessity for them; the thing they will have to do, instead of invading this country, will be to close the trade routes. Therefore, my Lords, that is the position as it stands at the present moment. The vital thing is to keep open the trade routes. The methods that the Navy propose to use for that purpose will automatically save us from invasion. That is a point that has not been tackled, as I say, by any speaker yet on behalf of the National Service League. They have not proved the case which, after all, is the foundation of their whole scheme&#x2014;that this country is liable to invasion; and I therefore submit that the view of the Committee of Imperial Defence, of the Government, and of the two great Departments which are chiefly concerned carries
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0494"/>
<col>937</col>
the day. According to that view, allowing for everything in the way of accidents and mishaps and miscalculations and over-calculations, 70,000 men is the maximum number that can under any possible circumstances come to this country. And, my Lords, I further submit this, that the force which we shall have in this country at our weakest moment immediately after mobilisation and if the whole of our Expeditionary Force is out of this country, will be capable of dealing with that 70,000 men. We shall have fourteen Territorial Divisions and fourteen Mounted Brigades. We shall be able, if it is necessary to do so, to bring them up to their war establishment by means of the Territorial Reserve, which includes not only men who have served in the Territorials but also ex-Regulars and ex-Special Reservists and Militiamen, and, if necessary, we shall be able to stiffen them&#x2014;that is, fill their ranks&#x2014;with some of those Regulars left in this country. In addition to the fourteen Divisions and fourteen Mounted Brigades, we shall have besides 160,000 men composed of Regulars, Regular Reservists, and Special Reservists. I believe that that is a force which is absolutely adequate for dealing with any invasion or raid up to the size&#x2014;allowing for an ample margin of safety as we have done&#x2014;that it is possible to land on these shores.<lb/>
Now I come to the final point, on which undoubtedly the scheme detailed in the noble Earl's book is superior to the present scheme. What its value is, I hesitate to say. I refer to the question of the Reserve that you will have behind your organised forces. You are to have, as I understand, this mass of half a million or so of men behind your Territorial Force, and you are to have a figure, which is not quite so easy to determine from the book, but something like 500,000 Reservists behind your Expeditionary Force. They are to be used, as we understand, for the possibility of expansion. I am extremely doubtful, when it comes to the practical test, as to how you are going to use those men for expansion. At any rate you will be only able to use them to a limited extent, and nothing like the extent that would be conveyed by their total numbers; for this simple reason, that you confessedly do not have in peace time any sort of organisation for them, and especially no officers. You can use those men to maintain drafts, and, to a limited extent, for forming new units, but to think that you are going in a
<col>938</col>
comparatively short time to form them into Battalions, Brigades, Divisions, and all that kind of thing, means that you are leaving out all the most important part of the machinery of an Army&#x2014;that is, the Staff work generally and the higher commands. It is quite true that on those lines you have provided ample material of men, but it has never been laid down clearly exactly for what purpose or how you are going to use them, beyond the rather vague word "expansion." After all, to have a big Reserve of that kind is not the monopoly of the compulsory system. You can have it, if you want it, under the voluntary system as well. Suppose the necessity were proved&#x2014;it has not been proved yet, and I think it would be a difficult thing to prove&#x2014;of having behind your organised forces hundreds of thousands of Reservists. The voluntary system passes men out of it at somewhere near 100,000 a year, and if some change took place which suddenly made it necessary to increase your home defence forces, or to build up a great Reserve, it is by no means beyond the wit of man, especially when that wit is coupled with the power of the purse and you are prepared to spend a good deal upon it, to arrange for those men as they are passed out to spend one, two, three, or four years, if you like, in a Reserve, with liability for Home defence, and you can by that means, and at far less expenditure than anything contemplated here, provide a Reserve numbering some hundreds of thousands. Therefore, even on that point I do not see that there is any very greatly marked advantage in the proposed compulsory system over what our present system could provide.<lb/>
My Lords, you are asked to break up everything that has been built up for so long in this country&#x2014;a system which has been made after great care, great trouble, and great experiment to fit into our requirements for peace, and, as far as we know, to our requirements for war as well&#x2014;and to replace tha-5 system by a system which is going to cost you far more; how much more it will cost I hesitate to say, but certainly a great deal more than the figures in the book, which leave out of account altogether such very important items as the whole of the pensions for your twenty-one years' service men, and there are a number of other errors equally big. You are asked to replace that by a system which, first of all, is going to be immensely more costly;
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0495"/>
<col>939</col>
which is going to be, with regard to certain definite points at any rate, of marked inferiority to your present system; which is based on most tremendous uncertainty on such points as recruiting; anti which is, admittedly, a scheme to meet, not what my noble friend so rightly calls the reasonable probabilities of war, but to meet a situation with regard to invasion to prove the correctness of which I submit the National Service League has signally failed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01813">The noble Duke said: My Lords, I rise to support the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. One of my reasons for so doing is the inadequacy of the troops available for home defence after the departure of the Expeditionary Force. The Secretary of State for War on February 28 last gave a table of these forces. That table I have reproduced in my Notice on the Paper. It shows our military forces left at home under six heads&#x2014;five being the Regular Forces and one the Territorial. I take the Regular Forces first; 55,988 Regular soldiers serving with the Colours are shown as left in the United Kingdom. Of these 29,623 would be, by the statement of the Secretary of State for War on March 1, 1911, under twenty years of age. We should, therefore, have at home 26,365 serving soldiers of over twenty years of age. It is I know said that there is no good reason for distinguishing between soldiers above and below twenty years of age. The noble Lord, Lord Haversham, in a discussion which took place in the House a short time ago, reminded us that boys of under twenty had fought at Waterloo and in the Crimea. But the noble Lord omitted to remind us of what happened to the boy
<col>940</col>
soldiers in the Crimea. May I therefore quote the account of an eye-witness? Sir William Russell in his "British Expedition to the Crimea," describing the failure of the attack on the Redan on September 8, 1855, writes as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The rapidly increasing swarms of wounded men, some of whom had left their arms behind them, at last gave rise to suspicions of the truth, but their answers to many eager questioners were not very decisive or intelligible, and some of them did not even know what they had been attacking. One poor young fellow, who was stumping stiffly up with a broken arm and a ball through his shoulder carried off his firelock with him, but he made the naive confession that he had never 'fired it off, for he could not.' The piece turned out to be in excellent order. it struck one that such men as these, however brave, were scarcely a lit match for the well-drilled soldiers of Russia; and yet we were trusting the honour, reputation and glory of Great Britain to undisciplined lads from the plough, or the lanes of our towns and villages. Nor can it be considered as ought but ominous of evil that there have been two Courts of Inquiry recently held concerning two most distinguished regiments&#x2014;one, indeed, belonging to the highest rank of Infantry; and the other a well-tried and gallant regiment, which was engaged in this very attack&#x2014;in consequence of the alleged misconduct of their young soldiers during night affairs in the trenches."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01814">Surely we do not want to repeat these failures. We are warned against their recurrence by those who are responsible. For instance, the Report on the health of the Army for the year ended 1909 comments on the want of maturity in our recruits, and ends by stating that&#x2014;
<quote>"it should not be forgotten that many of the lads will be incapable of doing the work of a seasoned soldier for at least two or three years."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01815">A similar report was made in 1907 and 1908.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01816">The second heading in the Table is the Regular Reserve, the strength of which after the departure of the Expeditionary Force is estimated at 34,871. The number of the Regular Reserve, according to the Army Estimates of 1911, is 136,337. Of these 85,023 are required for the Expeditionary Force by Table I of the Army Memorandum of April 8, 1907, leaving a surplus of 51,314. The following extra demands, not mentioned in the Army Memorandum of 1907, must, however, be made upon the strength of the Regular Reserve. By the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on November 15 last there would be required from the Regular Reserve to fill the deficiency in the Special Contingent 6,622 men; to serve with the Army Medical Corps, 1,739; for the Regular. Mounted Infantry in place of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0496"/>
<col>941</col>
non-Regular Cavalry for six Divisions, 2,016; for the two Mounted Brigades, 5,765. These additional demands total up to 16,142, thus making the total number required from the Regular Reserve up to 101,165, leaving 35,172. But of these 7,225 are resident abroad. We have therefore at home 27,94-7. Lord Lucas, when Tinder-Secretary of State for War, informed us on February 22 that it was necessary to allow on first calling up the Reserve ten per cent. for men who are unfit. Ten per cent. of the total strength of the Regular Reserve, less the number abroad, represents 12,911. Therefore, the number of the Regular Reservists at home fit for the field would be at present 15,036. We must, however, look ahead for a bit&#x2014;not more than eighteen months&#x2014;to the moment when the reductions initiated by the Government in the Regular Army have been fully realised. In 1913 the estimated strength of the first-class Regular Reserve is 106,372, a drop of 30,000 men. These 30,000 men will have left the Army Reserve without being replaced. We see, therefore, that in 1913 the figure of 34,871 given as surplus Reservists in the Table will be cancelled by the reductions now in process.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01817">In explaining the Army Estimates the noble Viscount said&#x2014;
<quote>"Inasmuch as the Reserve in 1913 would be the product of the system of nine years service with the Colours and three in the Reserve the battalion being full of nine years trained men would require fewer Reservists to mobilise."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01818">This means that when there is a drop of 30,000 men in the Reserve, there will be a corresponding increase in the number of men serving with the Colours of over twenty years of age. In short, the men for the Expeditionary Force will come from the Colours instead of from the Reserve. Now if 30.000 more men go abroad from the Colours and 30,000 men are gone from the Reserve, that makes a difference of 60,000 men of the Regular Army in the number left at home. Thus we see that in 1913 there will be 25,000 soldiers of the Regular Army left at home, and no surplus first-class Regular Reservists. This situation I believe the noble Viscount is trying to meet by forming pools of unallotted men, and by reopening the second class of the Army Reserve, that is Section D, for enlistment. The present pool is 3,700 men, lint how is that going to produce a Reserve of 30,000 men? We know for a fact that 30,000 men
<col>942</col>
disappear from the Regular Army by 1913. We know for a fact that nine Infantry battalions have been destroyed, and that the establishment of all Infantry battalions at home has been reduced by-thirty men per battalion&#x2014;that is a total of 2,220 men, a number equal to three Infantry battalions. We have thus lost the numerical equivalent of twelve Infantry reserve-creating <i>cadres</i>. The noble Viscount, in explaining the Army Estimates, stated that the wastage is now so much less that a battalion of 720 is equal or even better to-day as a reserve-creating machine than one of 800 was in the time of his predecessor. But whether this will prove to be the case or not we must "wait and see." Anyhow it cannot affect the difference which must be made in the numbers of the Reserve due to the loss of nine Infantry reserve-creating <i>cadres</i>.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01819">The third heading is the Special Reserve, of which 59,455 are tabled as available after the departure of the Expeditionary Force. By the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on November 15 last, 15,175 Special Reservists are required to form the Special Contingent of the Expeditionary Force on mobilisation, and to go abroad. The 59,455 less 15,175 leaves 44,280. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, told us that forty-seven per cent. of the Special Reserve go direct into the Line. In other words, forty-seven per cent. of the Special Reservists are Line recruits. I have before now alluded to the fact of such recruits being counted twice over, and I am now glad to see that this fact is recognised in the last Army Annual Return, which states&#x2014;
<quote>"Amongst the men entered as recruits for the Militia or Special Rese7ve are included a number who subsequently joined the Regular Forces; thus some are counted twic3 over as recruits, but so long as they are permitted to pass from one force to another this is not to be avoided."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01820">The available strength, then, of the Special Reserve is 44,280, but of these it must be remembered that by the Army Annual Return a considerable proportion must have been counted twice over&#x2014;with the Line and with the Special Reserve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01821">The fifth heading on the Table is the Militia and Militia Reserve showing a strength of 4,076. Since the Table from which I quote was made the number has already fallen, according to the Army Estimates of 1911 -1912, to 3,239. No
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0497"/>
<col>943</col>
future establishment is laid down. This is a moribund force, and I pass on to the last heading of 7,225 Regular Reservists residing abroad. In 1906 a Bill was passed giving powers to the Secretary of State for War to allow 10,000 Regular Reservists to reside abroad, but with a view to their services being of advantage to the military authorities on the spot, whether India, South Africa, or the Crown Colonies. Anyhow, it is obvious that since they are abroad they cannot be available for home defence or yet for embarking with the Expeditionary Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01822">Before considering the Territorial Army it would be well to examine the organisation and the composition of our Regualr Army of 100,000 men returned as available for home defence. On the departure of the Expeditionary Force we are left at home with four Regular Infantry battalions, three regiments of cavalry, and twenty-three service batteries of Artillery. I have already shown in detail in your Lordships' House&#x2014;and my figures were not challenged&#x2014;that if every Regular officer is taken from the four home battalions. then the Expeditionary Force would still be 575 Regular Infantry officers deficient, and we should not have a single Regular Infantry officer in the Army of the four home battalions. As regards the Infantry of the Special Reserve, there are seventy-four third or depot battalions and twenty-seven fourth battalions. The seventy-four depot battalions absorb all the unfit and immature men from the Line and all the incapable men from the Regular Reserve. None of these depot battalions are intended to be used as battalions in the field. They are deficient in officers and non-commissioned officers. In the whole Special Reserve Infantry there ought to be 1,915 subalterns. By the Return of February 27, 1911, there are 648 subalterns, a deficiency of 1,267. But by the Army Order of December 23, 1907, every Special Reserve and extra Special Reserve battalion must send four subaltern officers to the Line on mobilisation&#x2014;that is 404. This leaves 244, rather less than two and a half subalterns per battalion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01823">As regards non-commissioned officers a Line battalion would take into the field a staff of eighty non-commissioned officers for 880 trained men in the ranks. For the Special Reserve battalion a staff of thirty-two Regular non-commissioned officers is allowed to manage 1,000 or more
<col>944</col>
men and boys collected from different sources and devoid of all regimental discipline and feeling. Battalions so composed are' not battalions at all. They are mere crowds of men and boys, quite incapable of performing any military duty pertaining to a battalion. The fourth battalions have an establishment of 530 men; but many are below establishment. They have no Reserve and receive no additional men on mobilisation. They are intended, according to the statement of the noble Viscount on March 14 last, to go abroad in the same way as the old Militia battalions. One battalion, however, is short by twenty officers. Two more are each eighteen officers short, and none are less than ten officers deficient. Moreover, they have just been deprived of all their Regular officers with the exception of their adjutants. For foreign service they would not average more than 370 men per battalion. At present they are quite unfit for foreign service, and there is no prospect of their becoming fit for that duty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01824">It is true that it is proposed to increase their establishment up to 750 non-commissioned officers and men, but seeing that the Special Reserve Infantry is now more than 7,000 short of its establishment it is not easy to see how the additional 5,940 recruits are going to be obtained. I read in the Army Annual Report of 1911 that 7,503 less recruits were obtained for the Special Reserve than in the previous year, and that in spite of having reduced the height in October, 1909 to 5 ft. 2 in. You are at present 7,000 short in the Special Reserve Infantry, and you propose to increase the establishment by 5,940. You want to raise 12,940 additional recruits for the Special Reserve Infantry. Does the noble Viscount really imagine he is going to get these men? There are but two ways of increasing the intake of recruits; the first is to offer bounties, and the second to lower the standard. You cannot offer bounties for recruiting the Special Reserve without upsetting the whole recruiting of the Army. You certainly cannot lower the standard. We have just had an instance of what the present standard for the Special Reserve really is. A Special Reserve recruit was charged with desertion before the magistrate at the West London Police Court last 'February. The magistrate described the deserter as a child dressed as a soldier, and remitted the boy to the Children's
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0498"/>
<col>945</col>
Court, because he proved to be not sixteen years of ago. Now the noble Viscount, in answer to a question addressed to him on February 22 last, stated that this recruit, described by the magistrate as a child, was enlisted because he was up to the physical standard now in force. If the standard under which children are enlisted into the Special Reserve is lowered it means that you will open that force for the enlistment of infants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01825">The noble. Viscount, however, falls back upon the abnormal outflow, which, by the way, will cease in two years time, from the large Reserve created by his predecessors, and trusts to this to get him out of his difficulty. Hence the proposal for adding to the numbers of the extra Special Reserve battalions by re-enlisting men who have passed out of the Reserve of the Regular Army. At the moment when the Special Reserve was first created, enlistment into the second class of the Army Reserve&#x2014;that is Section D&#x2014;was closed. The proposal was then made to enlist men after twelve years of Colour and Reserve service into the Special Reserve. In the Army Annual Report for 1908 the point is dealt with as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The maximum age for a recruit, of the Special Reserve has been fixed at thirty. This limit has caused considerable comment and it has been pointed out that ex-soldiers are thereby debarred from enlisting into the Special Reserve on the termination of their Army and Reserve service. The point, however, is overlooked that these Special Reservists are required to take their places as drafts of the Regular Army. An ex-soldier on completion of his twelve years cannot he less than thirty and may be considerably more, while if he takes advantage of his opportunities and enlists in Section D he must be at least thirty-four. To enlist such ex-soldiers into the Special Reserve would mean that drafts for the Regular Army in time of war would be liable to be composed of men to a considerable extent who would be less fitted to undergo the arduous work of a campaign."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01826">On March 9, 1910, the noble Viscount objected to a proposal to allow men to reengage in the Army on completion of their first period of service with the Colours at the age of twenty-six on the score that "he did not want old stiff soldiers." Now, however, a man after he has been four years in Section D, the second class Army Reserve, is to be eligible for enlistment into the Special Reserve at about thirty-four years of age. The noble Viscount described these men on March 14 last, not as "old stiff soldiers," but as "youthful veterans." The noble Viscount and the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, differ widely in
<col>946</col>
their views as to which force the men are likely to prefer, whether they will re-enlist in Section D or go at once to the fourth battalions of the Special Reserve. Lord Lucas, in a letter to the Press on July 18 last, wrote as follow.
<quote>"Section D fills quickly whenever it is opened, and if the Army Council decide to keep it open for the next three or four years, we can say with Conviction based on yews of experience that it will contain from 15,000 to 20,000 men in 1011"</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01827">Then on. November 10, 1910, the noble Lord estimated the strength of Section D in 1913 at 24,895. On February 22 the noble Lord estimated the strength at 26,000 men. Then comes the noble Viscount, who, in explaining the Army Estimates, states that "comparatively few men go to Section D."</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01828">On consideration I expect the noble Viscount must hope that he is in the wrong and that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is in the right, because if there are not 25,000 men in Section D then the Expeditionary Force is absolutely bankrupt in the matter of numbers. But this is not only a question of quantity; it is a question of quality. The question I should like to put to the noble Viscount is this. Can he assure us that the men in Section D, the second class Army Reserve, upon whom he relies to make good the deficiencies in the first class Army Reserve, are in any way fit for the purpose for which he is going to use them? The noble Viscount must, in order to complete the numbers of his Expeditionary Force, send the Section D men abroad at once on mobilisation. We know from the evidence of Lord Methuen and Sir Thomas Kelly-Kenny that these men proved unfit for service in South Africa. Why, then, should they now prove fit for service in Europe or elsewhere That is a most important question, and I hope the noble Viscount will tell us something about it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01829">It is necessary to remember that the whole principle of the re-organisation of the Army was to substitute two lines for three. The Special Reserve and the Regular Army are to become one line on mobilisation. There is no force between the Regular Army and the Territorial Army. Now we have been told by the noble Viscount on June 27, 1910, that "the Special Reserve is not for mobilisation," and it is obvious from the nature of its composition that it cannot be used
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0499"/>
<col>947</col>
for that purpose. The Infantry has no Brigade organisation and has no transport. Therefore on the departure of the Expeditionary Force there is nothing left in the shape of an Army except the Territorial Force. The strength of the Territorial Army by the Table is 260,981 noncommissioned officers and men. The noble Viscount has told us that the full establishment of 303,257 non-commissioned officers and men is the minimum consistent with safety. When explaining the Army Estimates the noble Viscount did not anticipate a strength of more than 250,000 noncommissioned officers and men in time of peace. But still if 303,527 is the minimum consistent with safety, it would certainly seem that 250,000 were inconsistent with security. The noble Viscount is, of course, well aware that 166,093&#x2014;that is more than two-thirds of the number now serving&#x2014;become time-expired between 1911 and 1913. In less than two years 166,093 recruits must be raised to maintain the Territorial Army at its present strength of 260,981.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01830">It may be said that of course some men will re-engage. According to the figures given by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on July 18 last, nine per cent. had re-engaged during that quarter. That rate of nine per cent. will not do more than balance the rate of wastage amongst the 95,000 men whose term of service does not expire till a later date. It comes to this: if the noble Viscount raises 155,000 recruits in the course of the next two years he will then get his 250,000 non-commissioned officers and men. But it means that he must almost double for two years in succession the last Year's intake of 42,000. It seems to me, therefore, that the noble Viscount's estimate of 250,000 men as the future strength of the Territorial Army is an impossible one. The number of men in the Territorial Army on January 1, 1911, was 257,156. Of these, according to the statement of Lord Lucas, on March 20 last, 195,000 men ought to have fired their musketry course. In musketry 180,724 were tested. The number that failed to qualify was 53,812 and the number not tested 15,000, but 62,156 men were not required to do any musketry training at all. This large number of men not required to do musketry I do not understand, but it follows from the statement made by the noble Lord on March 20. Deducting men not qualified, men not tested, men not
<col>948</col>
required to do musketry&#x2014;a total of 131,000&#x2014;it leaves available for the firing line 126,000 men. But deductions must be made from that number for men who are unfit on mobilisation, for men who remain absent at home, for men who have emigrated abroad, and for recruits who are untrained. Then there were by the last Return 83,088 boys of under twenty years of age. Thousands of these boys do not weigh 1201bs. apiece. You have only to look at them to tell that. How can they carry a kit of 601bs., half their own weight, and march and fight? If they cannot carry ball ammunition, which is heavy, and a great coat and some rations, they are useless for active service. There are now in the Territorial Army 1,025 officers and 17,459 non-commissioned officers and men who have agreed to serve abroad on mobilisation and who will be absorbed by the Expeditionary Force. At least 45,000 men must be sent to garrison Ireland, which is left without any Regular regiments at all. Finally, a large number&#x2014;I cannot give figures because those are the secrets figures of mobilisation&#x2014;must be allotted for coast defences and for garrison duties in Great Britain, from which it is impossible to remove them in time of war.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01831">One conclusion only can be drawn from a careful study of these War Office figures and Returns, and it is this, that although we now have a gross total of 422,596 men remaining at home after the departure of the Expeditionary Force, yet in eighteen months time, when the reductions initiated in the Regular Army by the Government have been fully realised, we shall not have a field force of more than 60,000 men available for the defence of Great Britain. We have at length been told the use of the Territorial Army. We have been a long time arriving at it, but now we really have got at it, and it is this. The Territorial Army is to compel the invader to come with a force of not less than 70,000 men. In that event the Fleet undertake to swallow him up. It is all so easy and so simple, if the invader does just as we expect. But surely the strength of the invasion will depend, not upon the value which we attach to our Territorial troops, but upon the military value which the invader puts upon them. Possibly military history may influence him in forming his opinion upon this point. The later phases of the Franco-German war furnish examples of a citizen Army opposed to a Regular
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0500"/>
<col>949</col>
Army. On November 28, 1871, at Beaune- la-Rolande a French Army of 60,000 men with 138 guns was opposed to a German force of 11,000 men with seventy guns. Now here was a great opportunity for the citizen Army, with a superiority of five and a half to one in men and two to one in guns, to fall upon the invaders and crush them by sheer weight of numbers. The result of the action was that the Germans were victorious. The French lost 1,300 killed and wounded, and 1,800 unwounded prisoners. The German loss was 900 killed and wounded. I take the figures from the German official history of the war compiled by the General Staff.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01832">Now why should the invader trouble to come with 70,000 men when 15,000 men would be sufficient? It may be said that it is absurd to talk about the invasion of England with 15,000 men. But given that 15,000 men were once landed, it is not absurd to say that they will win their first action. On the contrary it is precisely what you must expect from the teaching of military history and from the quality and the quantity of the opposing forces. Imagine the consternation throughout the Empire and the wonder throughout the world when it was known that the invasion of England was an accomplished fact, and that the Territorial Army had been defeated in their first action. If my criticisms of our forces are of a destructive character it is not because I underrate the immense difficulty of creating an Army for the defence of our Empire under the altered strategic conditions of Europe. I fully recognise the difficulty. I admire the ability, the zeal, and the untiring energy displayed by the noble Viscount opposite in his attempt to reorganise our Army. But T do protest and shall always protest against any attempt to hypnotise the country with imposing displays of paper figures which lull the nation into a false sense of security by producing an exaggerated idea of the real value of its defensive forces. For these reasons, my Lords, if the noble and gallant Field-Marshal goes to a Division I shall have much pleasure in giving him my vote.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01833"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War will allow me to introduce myself to him as a not unfriendly critic of his administration. Indeed I am a warm
<col>950</col>
admirer of many things that he has done, and since he cannot have any knowledge of my obscure activities I should like to take this opportunity of telling him that in the many speeches I make in different parts of the country on the subject of National Defence, I very seldom lose the opportunity of asserting that the nation owes him a debt of gratitude for a great deal of his work, and particularly for the untiring and resourceful energy with which he has done that work. I am also one of those political opponents whom the noble Viscount has so dexterously employed to assist him in making the Territorial Force a success. I know that the political friends of the noble Viscount think it extremely wrong for chairmen of County Associations to criticise the Territorial scheme, but I am sure the noble Viscount himself does not share that view. On the contrary, he must think, as we do, that those who are privileged to take part in the administration of a national system are under a special duty and obligation to point out to their fellow-countrymen whether that system is satisfactory, and whether in their opinion it is working well or not. It is from that point of view, as well as from the point of view of one who has had twenty-five years of personal experience as a Volunteer, that have felt bound to take part in the criticism of our military system, and to study, to the best of my humble ability, the great military problem in which it is a factor.<lb/>
But before I venture to address any further remarks to the noble Viscount, I should like to say a few words in reply to his late Lieutenant. I am sure the House will be with me when I say that we congratulate the noble Lord on his promotion to another sphere, and that we all recognise the great gallantry and resourcefulness with which he has faced overwhelming numbers of antagonists in controversy. The noble Lord, I thought, rather wasted his time in criticising the <i>obiter dicta</i>, or tentative suggestions, put forward by the writer who assisted the noble and gallant Field-Marshal in his book, instead of criticising the proposals of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal himself. The noble Lord spent all his time in endeavouring to ridicule a scheme which has no authority except that of the writer of the second part of this book, which has not even been discussed by anybody else, and which on the face of it is merely put forward as a tenta-
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0501"/>
<col>951</col>
tive suggestion. In the circumstances, I do not think it necessary to take up the criticisms of the noble Lord. But I cannot help thinking that the reason why lie adopted that course is the same as that which actuated General Sir Ian Hamilton when he devoted the greater part of his memorable document to the criticism of schemes which had never been put forward by anybody. It was simply because the noble Lord was not able to answer my noble and gallant friend on the Cross Benches. That is why he preferred to answer an anonymous writer who was speaking only for himself. The other complaint of my noble friend opposite was that nobody had dealt with Sir Arthur Wilson's Memorandum. I confess that that statement astonished me, for it seemed to me that the whole of the speech of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal was in effect a reply to that Memorandum. I have a very distinct recollection of his pointing out in considerable detail that Sir Arthur Wilson had assumed that the enemy would have everything against them and that we should have everything in our favour. Therefore, again, I do not think it necessary to repeat arguments which have already been so fully given, and I will only express my surprise that they should have escaped the recollection of the noble Lord.<lb/>
But there is one of his remarks to which F should like to call attention, for it was singular enough. He told us, and presumably he speaks for the Government, that the Navy, in the course of defending our trade routes, would automatically save us from invasion. Well, my Lords, that is a view which we cannot accept in spite of any expert opinion. We do not believe that the Navy will automatically save us, and the mere fact that it is considered necessary to have a Home Defence Army at all is surely sufficient to prove that we cannot rely on the automatic action of the Navy. Lastly, the noble Lord told us that it would be possible to provide for expansion by building up a Reserve from the Territorial Force, and he hinted that that could be done by means of the power of the purse. In default of details as to the amount which would be given to each soldier to enrol himself in the Reserve and as to other particulars, it is hardly worth while to speculate upon that possibility. But I should like to say this in regard to the concluding remarks which my noble friend made. He accused us of
<col>952</col>
wishing to break up the existing system. Speaking from the point of view of the National Service League, I say that that is an entire misapprehension of our objects, for we assert on every platform that we have no desire to break up the Territorial scheme. What we want to do is to give it the two things which are essential to its success&#x2014;sufficiency of numbers and sufficiency of training.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I turn once more to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War. The greatest service which he has rendered to the nation is that he has undoubtedly aroused widespread and unprecedented interest in the questions of national defence and military administration, and also that he has enjoined the practice of clear thinking on the military problem. Since the noble Viscount commenced that process and set that fashion, many others have been endeavouring to follow his example. The result is that we have gone some way beyond the old idea that all that was necessary was to tinker at the existing system. We have thought it best to go to the root of things. Instead of considering only how the Army can be improved, we have asked ourselves as a necessary preliminary what the Army is for, and whether it is in every respect suitable for the purpose for which we believe it to exist and for which indeed we believe every army to exist. We have begun to realise also, thanks to the precepts of the noble Viscount, that circumstances have changed, not only our circumstances but also those of other nations, and that a system that suited our needs fifty years ago is not necessarily suitable at the present time. We agree with the noble Viscount that there is still that same strip of sea between us and the Continent, but we cannot fail to perceive that the means of crossing that strip have been considerably improved.<lb/>
For generations past our forefathers were able to sleep in their beds with the comfortable assurance that British sea power was unchallenged and unchallengeable. But has not that changed? Is there anybody who can say at the present day that our seapower is unchallenged? We know that it has been challenged, and by a competitor who makes no idle boast. In short, we have begun to ask ourselves whether the armed forces of the Crown
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0502"/>
<col>953</col>
are ready for a European war at any moment. That. I am sure the noble Viscount will admit is within the scope of reasonable possibility, which is the standard he himself laid clown. We may possibly be obliged in the future, as we have often been obliged in the past, to engage in a war with one of the nations of Europe, or to take part in a war in which several of the nations of Europe are engaged. That surely is a proposition which does not need to be established by any argument. It is self-evident. If it were otherwise, why should we be obliged to maintain a powerful Fleet in European waters, and why should we need to have a Home Defence Army at all? My Lords, were such a war unhappily to be forced upon us, we might have to fight upon land as well as at sea. That also I venture to think is self-evident. It is unnecessary, and perhaps undesirable, to suggest possible contingencies. Past history affords us many examples, and the principles of strategy seem to show us that it is not possible to bring a war to a successful conclusion at sea alone. And looking at the political situation there is nothing in the present state of Europe to render it impossible&#x2014;I will not put it higher than that&#x2014;that we might once again be obliged to fight on land, and on the Continent, for our own safety and our own independence. It seems to me that our security and our freedom depend no less upon the maintenance of the balance of power in. Europe than they did in the days of Napoleon and at other periods of our history. It follows therefore, it seems to into, quite logically that the real problem is whether our armed forces are ready for such a contingency. I need not discuss how, when, or where it might arise. Are they ready now to deal with any strategical situation in which we might reasonably expect to be involved at the outbreak of a war in Europe? That is the question.<lb/>
My Lords, what is the situation so far as our armed strength is concerned? I shall endeavour to deal with generalities, rather than with the details, of which we have had such able and copious exposition. The situation is this. We have a magnificent Navy which we believe to be in the highest possible state of efficiency and readiness, and which for the present is up to the standard of numerical strength which for a long time past we have believed to be essential to our needs. Whether we are likely to maintain
<col>954</col>
that standard during the next few years, and whether we shall be able to maintain it in the more remote future, are questions which it would not be appropriate to discuss at this moment. But our Fleets are not free to go anywhere to fight our battles, which is the proper function of Fleets, because they are hampered by the necessity of guarding their base&#x2014;that is to say, of guarding these shores. The idea which is gaining ground, in violation of all strategical principles. is that the Navy is to he used primarily as a coast-guard for these shores. The noble Viscount himself fully accepts the doctrine which has indeed at all times been one, of the first axioms of strategy, that there is no sure defence except unhampered power of attack, but he does not seem to recognise that until we can depend upon our land forces to prevent invasion the Navy will not be absolutely free to seek out and attack our enemy wherever that enemy may be. Our Navy, therefore, is not as free to act as are the Fleets of foreign nations, none of which are fettered in the same way. But we may have to fight on land and on the Continent of Europe, and for that purpose we have what is called a striking Force, and that very term surely admits the truth of the doctrine that in order to be able to defend ourselves we must also be able to attack. The question, therefore, is whether our Striking Force is able to strike&#x2014;is able to strike at once and. with full strength. It is surely unnecessary to argue that a blow which is given too late or without sufficient force is not likely to be effective. It may also be necessary to repeat the blow, and therefore a Striking Force or an Expeditionary Force has to be maintained in the field.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said last night that we could mobilise the whole of our six Divisions; but that is not a complete answer. That does not allay the anxiety which has given rise to this debate. What we want to know is, How soon can he mobilise those Divisions '? Can he mobilise them within the first ten days of the war? According to the opinions of all experts anything later than that is likely to be too late. Neither did the noble Viscount tell us with what detriment to the Reserve and the Home Defence Army he would be able to carry out his promise to mobilise the Expeditionary Force. Here, again, we are hampered. by the defencelessness of our base. Even if we could send away the whole
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0503"/>
<col>955</col>
of our Expeditionary Force at once in good time and maintain it in the field, we should not dare to do so&#x2014;this has appeared from all that has been said&#x2014;because part of it is required to defend this country from invasion, a function which ought to be left to the Home Defence Army. It is required, we are told, and the late Under-Secretary repeated it, to stiffen the Territorials until they have been sufficiently trained. But unfortunately we know, what is worse, that the whole Expeditionary Force cannot be mobilised at once&#x2014;that is to say, within the first few days after the outbreak of war&#x2014;days and therefore our Regular Army also is not as ready or as free to act as are the armies of other European nations. Thirdly, what about the so-called Home Defence Army&#x2014;the Territorial Force? After all that has been said, it is not necessary to say more than that it is not sufficient in numbers or sufficiently trained to be available for effective use at short notice. That is a proposition from which I am sure nobody will dissent. The position, therefore, which is manifest to anybody who is acquainted with the simple facts&#x2014;for they are simple enough to those who will take the trouble to think&#x2014;is that none of our armed forces are ready for immediate and unfettered action. They are all hampered by being tied together. Instead of being able to co-operate and help one another by the full and free use of their individual powers, they are mischievously dependent upon one another, and both the Navy and the Army are hampered by the weakness and the unreadiness of the Territorial Force. This is a sufficiently disquieting and unsatisfactory result of the expenditure of millions of money, and of constant alterations and reforms in our system.<lb/>
It would seem to be imperative, at any rate to ordinary people, to find a remedy. But the remedy, so far as this part of the problem is concerned, seems also to ordinary people to be fairly obvious. It is to make the Territorial Force ready for use at short notice, for it is certain that we shall only get short notice in the case of a European war. That is impossible under the voluntary system. It is unnecessary to argue that which is admitted by all, and which has been proved by long experience. If we want to establish a system which is satisfactory from the point of view which I have ventured to set forth the voluntary system must go, and in one form or another we must train all our able-bodied manhood
<col>956</col>
to fight for the safety, honour, and welfare of the nation. just as do all the other nations. of Europe. We must have that "Nation in Arms" which the noble Viscount so rightly made his ideal when he commenced his great task if we are to be able to hold our own against other nations in arms. And why not? There is no reason whatever, if we go back to root principles and consider what is the object of armies of all nations. The object of armies is not so much to fight as to prevent war, and there is nothing which we all of us more fervently desire than the prevention of war. Surely we cannot be reluctant to do anything which may be necessary in order to prevent war. But the noble Viscount has thought it right&#x2014;and we of the National Service League do not blame him. for we recognise the circumstances&#x2014;to argue against the proposals for national service. He has found that it is not sufficient to tell people who have. taken to clear thinking that the Government are not going to be "dragooned" into into "Conscription." He has therefore discarded the old arguments and put forward a new one, to winch he seems to be sticking with some consistency. He tells us that national service would interfere with recruiting for the Regular Army, but unfortunately he has not told us, or attempted to tell us, why it would do so. All our experience points to the contrary, and so far as our clear thinking goes, we feel obliged to reject the assertion.<lb/>
Let us consider, in the first place, why men enlist in the Army at the present time. That is the way to get to the root of the problem. A small minority, I believe, enlist because they have a taste for military life, and it is difficult to see why such men should be deterred from following their inclinations just because their fellow-citizens were obliged to go through a period of military training. On the contrary, there is every reason to suppose that they would take a greater pride in having special and professional knowledge of that which was the business of all. Again, there are many existing prejudices against the Army which would surely disappear when every family in the kingdom contained some man who knew something about the Army and what was meant by military service. But why do the rest enlist? Simply because they are out of work, because they are hungry and cold. Now, if universal service is going to do away with that stimulus to recruiting; if it is going to bring to an
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0504"/>
<col>957</col>
end, or to materially diminish, unemployment and destitution, then for goodness sake let us have universal service. It will be the solution of one of the most pressing and cruel social evils of the time, and prove the most excellent social reform we could possibly bring about. Does the noble Viscount think that he would have the people of this country with him if he declared that unemployment and destitution must continue in order that we may have recruits for the Regular Army under the voluntary system? Yet that is the logical conclusion to which we are driven if we accept his argument, or rather his assertion, for he has not thus far supported his statement by any attempt at proof. But we do not accept his assertion, and we believe, as the result of clear thinking and actual experience, that we should get more recruits for our long range Army if we had universal service for our short range Army. The spirit of adventure is still alive in this country, and I believe there are thousands who would join the Army to-day if they were not entirely ignorant of the advantages of military life.<lb/>
I began by saying that the noble Viscount had done much good work. For that we are grateful to him, and I think there have been many admissions during the course of this debate of the sincerity of our feelings in that respect. But I venture to think that, much though he has done, he has chosen the easiest part of the great task which lay before him when he commenced his administration. He has been repairing and improving the old machine instead of setting up a new one. What we want. is an Army adapted to our present needs, and capable of dealing with any strategical necessities in which we might be involved within the scope of reasonable possibility by the changed circumstances of the European situation. We want a Striking Force that can strike, and a Citizen Army which is ready to fight at short notice. It is only thus that we can prevent war both for ourselves and for our friends and neighbours on the Continent. It is idle to suppose that an enemy ready to strike at us will wait until we are prepared to ward off his blow, or that an invader will be deterred from invading us by the existence of an Army, however numerous, which is not ready for active service. If we want to force the enemy to bring an invading force which will afford a sufficiently large target for the Fleet, it must be by means of a real Army,
<col>958</col>
an Army which is ready to fight at once. But by far the better plan is to have a Home Defence Army so strong that the would-be invader would never dream of coming at all. That is the ideal which we of the National Service League, who have taken up the noble Viscount's phrase of a "Nation in Arms," have at heart, and that is the task which the noble Viscount set himself in the beginning, and which he still has before him.<lb/>
My Lords, I have the actual words which the noble Viscount used in the speech which he told us last night had been misrepresented. I am sure your Lordships wilt not blame me for quoting them, as they are worth bearing in mind. Speaking at Newcastle-on-Tyne on September 14, 1906, the noble Viscount sail this&#x2014;
<quote>"They must look to great expansion in time of war, and for that expansion they must go to the-nation and ask for the co-operation of the nation. A nation in arms was the only safeguard for the public interests. If we had sufficient national enthusiasm we might manage to get into the field and maintain an Army of seven, eight, or nine hundred thousand men. That would require national spirit, but he thought the thing was within compass. IL did not pass human wit to devise a system under which a very much larger expansion than any that had yet been contemplated might be formed on the broad basis of the Military Cone."</quote>
That was the problem&#x2014;expansion in time of war&#x2014;and that is the task which the noble Viscount himself undertook. It still lies before him. It is for him to arouse national enthusiasm and to continue-preaching the ideal of a Nation in Arms, and so to devise that system of expansion which he tells us it does not pass human wit to devise.<lb/>
In reply to objections that were made from his side of the House, I should like to say that none of us expect the noble Viscount to bring in a Bill for universal service. We fully recognise that neither Party in the State could do that in the present condition of public opinion. We also hold that this is not a Party question. It is a national question, and a national question can only be settled by national consent. How are we to get national consent? We are doing our best to educate public opinion up to this ideal, but we shall never succeed unless they get a lead from the Statesmen and politicians who are at the head of affairs in both Parties. If the political leaders agree, the consent of the nation would follow very quickly and very easily. I, for one, do not doubt- for a single moment that the nation would
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0505"/>
<col>959</col>
unhesitatingly accept the obligation if the necessity were pointed out to them. There is nobody who is in a better position than the noble Viscount himself to make the first move, and to bring about that agreement among the leaders which would lead to national consent. He holds, as my noble friend on this Bench pointed out this afternoon, a unique position. He has established a great reputation and a great influence, and I do not doubt for one moment that anything which he declared to be necessary now would be accepted, not only by a large number of his own Party, but also by the overwhelming majority of his political opponents. The impression which the speech of the noble Viscount left on my mind, I am glad to say, was that he still retained an open mind on the question, and I hope, therefore, that he may vet crown his distinguished career by adopting a course which I fully admit would require an amount of courage and patriotism which has seldom been displayed in political life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01834"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for being the third in succession to rise on this side of the House, but perhaps it is not altogether inappropriate as I am in that undesirable position of feeling myself at the present moment not entirely in accord with either side. I certainly disagree with one statement made by my noble relative just now, when he said that never had there been a time when greater interest was taken in national defence than at the present moment. I wish he was right. I think, as a matter of fact, that never has there been more apathy shown than at the present moment. There are a great many enthusiasts working one way or the other, but the general mass of the public at the present moment is in a complete state of apathy as regards our national defence; and, if I may say so without offence, I think the reason is that both sides rather over-state their respective cases and the public, deluged with blasts of figures on one side and counter-blasts of figures on the other, cannot in the least realise what the true position is. I venture to hope that in this debate, in which figures have been placed before your Lordships with extreme moderation, we may be able to interest the public more, and that they will more clearly see what the position is at the present moment.<lb/>
I should like to say one word&#x2014;and it is the only subject with which I propose to
<col>960</col>
deal&#x2014;on the subject of the Territorial Force. I have been a great advocate of that Force, and am still a complete believer in it up to a certain point; but what I do deprecate is the way in which the Territorial Force has been spoken of, not in this debate but in the country at large. Speeches are made which begin by complimenting the Territorial Force and telling them that they are a bright example to the rest of the country, but, that having been said, the whole of the rest of those speeches is generally devoted to showing that under no circumstances could they be of any earthly use to their country if called upon. I venture to say that is just as great an exaggeration as is the statement on the other side that with a very short training they would be fit to pit against the best picked troops that might come to this country. I would ask those who do not know the Territorial Force and what they do not to judge them by the fortnight's training they undergo and by the compulsory forty drills. That is not by any means the extent of the training that they get. Many of them, I know of my own knowledge, put in scores more drills than they are compulsorily obliged to do, and they are infinitely better trained in my opinion than those figures and days would give the general public to understand. That statement is not based in any way on official reports. I never have believed for one minute in official reports. I go by what the best men who have had personal experience of the handling of these Territorials in large masses tell one privately, and I have no hesitation in saying that those I have come across are most favourably impressed with this Force&#x2014;much more favourably impressed than they expected to be when they first came into contact. with it.<lb/>
I would now like to turn to the other side, who ask the noble Viscount to use the Territorial Force as an answer to those who advocate a national service. If he is going to use that as his answer, lie must be prepared to substantiate in every way his assertion that they are up to the standard that he himself laid down. I want to ask him one or two questions on that point. The first question is with regard to numbers. When the noble Viscount first put forward his proposal for the Territorial Army he mentioned a certain figure as being the minimum number required for the safety of this country.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0506"/>
<col>961</col>
He last night told us that he had got five-sixths of that number, and he expected us to wax enthusiastic about it. Well, I refuse to do so; and I still more refuse to accept with complacency his willingness to look upon that as being a satisfactory number. I ask, At what particular percentage below the required minimum number will his complacency give way to some apprehension as to the state of that Force? And I should be still more obliged if the noble Viscount would tell us whether, in the event a its going below a new minimum he may impose, he will then be ready to take the step which I and a great many others in this House advocate&#x2014;that is, that if he cannot get the men to make up the number by voluntary means he should then employ some means of compulsion. Will he tell us, therefore, what, is the number that he is prepared to see the Force reduced to? I daresay he will answer by saying, "Oh, you can make up that sixth very easily by the number of Reserves you have got at the present moment. You will get Reserves from which you will be able to fill up the whole of your requirements." Yes, but at what expense? Does the noble Viscount not realise that to make up his deficiency from the Reserves in time of war would be to use that which ought to be utilised for the wastage of war to make good the shortage in time of peace? He ought in no way to rely on the Reserves he may have to make good the shortage, which, if it cannot be got by voluntary means in time of peace, must be got by other means.<lb/>
There is one other question to which I would refer, and that is with regard to stores. If an Army is to go into the field it must be complete not only in numbers but in stores. Last year in a debate in your Lordships' House Lord Ashby St. Ledgers made the rash statement that the Force was complete in every respect. I do not think much attention was paid to Lord Ashby St. Ledgers' statement, and it was disproved directly afterwards. I ask the noble Viscount what has been done to make that good since, and I ask him with a rather striking fact in my mind at the moment. It is a local matter, but I dare say your Lordships will forgive me for mentioning it. We are called upon in the West Lancashire Division to send a Brigade of Infantry of four battalions to the Army man&#x0153;uvres this year. We hope to send four battalions 750 strong apiece. As soon
<col>962</col>
as we knew it was to be done, a small committee was formed to find out what the requirements of that Brigade were, in order to give them what Line regiments under similar circumstances would require, and I received yesterday an estimate from the Association which tells me that, granted we can get certain things from the Government, for that one Brigade alone for a fortnight's man&#x0153;uvers we have to call on the patriotic spirit of the locality to contribute &#x00A3;3,200 to mobilise them&#x2014;that is for a fortnight of Army man&#x0153;uvres. Surely, my Lords, that speaks for itself as to the absolute deficiency there is in the way of mobilisation stores for the Territorial Army, and without mobilisation stores it is no use having your men and it is no use spending your money on those men in time of peace.<lb/>
I will go back for one minute, if I may, to the question of the deficiency of men. Personally I am generally of a sanguine nature, but I confess I am not sanguine when I think of the possibility of keeping up even to our present strength. There was a great wave of enthusiasm last year, but I am perfectly certain that there is a distinct diminution in the feeling that prompted men to come forward last year, and if I may say so with due respect to the noble Viscount, abuse of the National Service League will not help him to get men. They have in our part of the world helped us very considerably and in every way to recruit our ranks. You have to face one other point that I have not heard dealt with to-day, and that is the question of the employers. There is no doubt whatever that you are having more, and will have more, difficulty in getting permission from employers for their men to go to camp. We have found it growing every year, and it stands to reason that it should be so. It has come to personal canvassing in many cases amongst employers. Employers who are willing themselves to permit their men to absent themselves for the training are able to point to bitter rivals in business who will not allow a single one of their men to go into camp. Human nature is human nature, and men will look after themselves first, and I am sorry to say that we are finding greater difficulty in getting even the limited amount of training that is at the present moment allotted to the Territorial Force. I venture to think that the noble Viscount will have to consider the advisability of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0507"/>
<col>963</col>
some sort of compulsion being applied to force one and all to allow their men to go into the Territorial Force if into no other highly trained force.<lb/>
I am afraid I am in the difficult position of not being in entire agreement with either side, not having been wholly convinced even by the arguments that I have heard here. I confess that there is one question which I should like to have answered by the military experts of the War Office. The noble Viscount has set, if I may say so, what is a very had precedent. He has allowed a pamphlet to be written by a military expert, and has himself written the preface to it. I wish the noble Viscount would change the situation and write the pamphlet himself and let the military authorities, without fear, let, or hindrance, write the preface. I venture to think that it might have a startling effect, and I am perfectly certain it would carry great weight in the country. I for one should then be perfectly prepared to accept, as I am not at the present moment, their statement. as to the adequacy of our defence. The question which I would like the military experts to answer categorically is, Are they prepared, in the event of the Expeditionary Force being sent abroad, even with six months' training, to defend the country against the attack of 70,000 picked German troops by means of the Regulars left behind and the Territorial Force? If they say, "Yes," I confess I should be surprised, but I should accept the answer, at all events for the time, as being conclusive. I have ventured to say these few words to your Lordships although I have no new project to put forward. But I do ask the noble Viscount whether he will answer the questions I have asked him, and if he is able to answer them and to give the military hacking, if I may say so, to the statements, then I think that this debate will have done a great deal in allaying some of the anxiety which I believe the thinking part of the public have at the present moment with regard to our national defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01835"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask leave to detain your Lordships for a very few moments on the one question of home defence. I wish to emphasise as much as possible the closing words of the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Milner, yesterday afternoon. It seems to me that we have a right to ask from the men of this country those sacrifices which are necessary to secure the safety of the
<col>964</col>
country in the event of invasion. It is thought that invasion is impossible or at all events so improbable that it is a contingency which need not be seriously considered. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, if I correctly understood his remarks this afternoon, told us, on the strength of the Admiralty Memorandum, that the fear of a foreign army landing in this country is one which we may almost dismiss, that it is practically impossible and need not alarm us.<lb/>
But, my Lords, it is just those things which are most improbable and which are supposed to be impossible which do occur. Would any one have supposed antecedently that in the short period of six weeks Austria would have been left defenceless before the Prussian armies? Much less would any one have predicted that in less than a year the whole of France would have been overrun by German armies, Paris besieged and compelled by starvation to surrender, and France compelled to accept all the terms Germany chose to impose upon her. Had such prophecies been made a year or two before those occurrences they would have been dismissed as highly improbable But they did occur, and if we are wise we should take warning by what has happened in the case of our neighbours. However improbable we may think any contingency of that sort occurring to ourselves, we have a right to ask of our countrymen that they shall take those measures which are necessary to secure us from the alternative of which the noble Viscount, Lord Milner, spoke yesterday afternoon, of having to choose in such a war as might be forced upon us between sacrificing the safety of India and our Colonies and the safety of our own shores. And I believe that compulsory military training imposed upon all, from the highest to the lowest, is the only measure that will give us real security in regard to such a contingency. I do not for one single moment believe that if that question were put before the men of this country irrespective of Party they would hesitate what answer to give to it.<lb/>
My reason for that belief is this. I have taken some trouble to ascertain the general feeling of the working classes in the north of England. I have several times had to address them on various subjects. Among those subjects has been the need for the defence of this country by a system of universal compulsory military training, a
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0508"/>
<col>965</col>
system of training irrespective of class, imposed upon all from the highest to the lowest, and I have never found that expression of opinion received with anything but welcome and applause. I should like to re-echo what has been said this afternoon, that this is in no sense a Party question it is a question which concerns the safety of our country, and I believe that, over and above the security which it would give us, a universal system of compulsory military training would be of the utmost value with regard to the physique, the health, the intelligence, and the well-being of the men of this country. And if we wish for another reason why it would not be unpopular, may we not refer to the astonishing way in which the Boy Scout movement has been taken up and accepted throughout. the whole of the country? The reasons which make that movement popular are precisely those to which you would appeal by a general system of compulsory military training. My Lords, one of the reasons why I welcomed the Territorial scheme of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War was that I thought, as far as I was able to understand it, that it provided a machinery by which we might have compulsory military training which I believe to be essential for the security of the country and for the good of the country in all ways. It seems to provide a machinery for establishing that system with very little trouble, and it would put us in possession of the required training almost immediately if the matter could, as I have said, be brought before the country irrespective of Party, and we could all be stirred up to see the necessity of some such measure to place England in that position of safety and security which we all wish to see our country occupy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01836"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BELHAVEN AND STENTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to support the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, and in doing so I do not intend to take up more than a very few moments of the time of the House. The noble Viscount who has just sat down has spoken very strongly in favour of compulsory military training. That, no doubt, is a counsel of perfection which I hope some day we may see realised. But there is a great deal of difference between compulsory military training for every man who arrives at the age of eighteen or twenty, and the liability to that compulsory military training which
<col>966</col>
may be necessary for a certain number in order to fill up the gaps in our Home Defence Army. I cannot agree altogether with the scheme of the National Service League. There is one detail in the scheme laid down in the Bill which was brought forward by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal eighteen months ago of which I could not at all approve. He proposed a four or six months' preliminary training for those who were called up. If we are to have a Force which is to defend our country against the possible invasion of highly trained troops, then I consider that nothing less than one year's training is sufficient. I will say later why I mention one year. Six months training means really nothing more than making recruits of them, and I appeal to any noble Lord who has served in the Regular Army whether he would like to go into action with a body of recruits with six months' training, still less if those men after their six months' training had returned to civil life and had not used their arms except for occasional exercises for three, four, or five years.<lb/>
I base myself also on the Duke of Norfolk's Commission. In their Report they say&#x2014;&#x2014;
<quote>"we believe that the necessary thorough training could be given within one year, after which only one or two annual periods of a few weeks exercises, or man&#x0153;uvers would be needed."</quote>
With that I entirely agree. But there are other objections to the six months' training which I wish to point out. What period of the year would be selected for that six months' training? I know that that has been discussed, and it was at one time proposed that they should be trained in winter. But what sort; of a training would you give to them if you called them up on October 1 and dismissed them at the end of March? What with the dark days, the bad weather, and all the disadvantages of winter, the training that would be given would not be equal to two months' training in summer time; so that I think we may entirely dismiss the idea that the six months' training could be given in winter. Then, again, if you take the men up in the beginning of April and dismiss them at the end of September, what complaints there would be in other ways. The summer is just the time at which labour is most wanted, just the time when there are fewest unemployed. It would probably cause a great deal of inconvenience to take these men away from their work in April, and at the end of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0509"/>
<col>967</col>
September turn them off again only to join the already too numerous army of unemployed. On the other hand, if you call your men up for twelve months, you are able to call them up at the beginning of winter, say early in October. You must, of course, have drill halls and other conveniences for drilling under cover, and you would take advantage of those on the dark days and in the bad weather. Then on the fine days you could train your men in the open in marching, and so on, and so bring them up to a considerable degree of firmness of muscle by the time Spring arrived. You would then have everything you wanted in the way of weather in the open air, and you could finish up with man&#x0153;uvres in September and then dismiss your men. Let us see how this would affect the labour market. Just the same number of men that you return at the end of September to seek employment&#x2014;whether 60.000. 70,000 or 80,000&#x2014;would be called up at the beginning of October, and with judicious arrangements beforehand I believe that a billet could be found for every man whom you had trained in the filling up of the vacancies which would be created by the men who were called up to undergo their training for the next year. In this way the labour market would be affected only to a minimum degree, and I believe that the Service would be much more popular than it is likely to be by any of the other methods that have been suggested.</membercontribution></p>

LEVAN</member><membercontribution>: I have no reason to regret all that I did then to promote the efficiency of the new Territorial Force, and having commanded a Brigade for two years under the old system and two years under the new system I have had, perhaps, an unusually favourable opportunity of comparing the two, and I have no hesitation in saying that the new Force is far superior to the old one. It is superior, as we have heard before, in organisation, in training, and in the quality of the men. The noble Viscount has heard this repeated so often in the course of this debate that he must be almost tired of hearing it. but I should not like him, or anybody who knows my connection with the Force, to think that I had any reason for thinking otherwise.<lb/>
It appears to me, after listening to this debate, that the one important point which is before us is the question of the efficiency of the Territorial Force, and the question of the deficiency or insufficiency of that Force is due a great deal to the method of the training of the Force. It has been said by the noble Lords on this side of the House, and I have not heard it seriously disputed on the other side of the House, that the present training of the Territorial Force is not adequate to make them fit to meet the best foreign troops in the field. I do not think there is any question about that. It has also been pointed out that the brunt of the attack, if invasion does come about, will fall on the Territorial Force. I should have thought, that being the case, that the question of the increased training of the Territorial Force would have come before the House; but I have heard nothing from the noble Viscount opposite, or from any noble Lord who has spoken on that side of the House, to indicate any intention or any hope of their being able to give that increased training to the Territorial Force. I suppose that if we could rely upon a Territorial Force of 270,000 men sufficiently trained the minds of most of us would be considerably set at rest, but although all are agreed that the Territorial Force do not have sufficient training, we have heard of no promise or hope of that training being increased at all, or to any adequate degree. That makes it very difficult, I think, for anybody to vote
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0510"/>
<col>969</col>
against the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal.<lb/>
I quite know the difficulty there is about increasing the training&#x2014;I may say nobody more so&#x2014;and I wish to endorse as strongly as I can the words that were said just now by the noble Earl who spoke about the difficulty of the employers. It is a difficulty which employers have also put before me, and I am quite sure the noble Viscount, unless he can overcome that difficulty, which I may shortly describe as the inequality of sacrifice, will find it an increasing and serious obstacle to the welfare of his Force. At the same time, my Lords, while I find it difficult to dissent from the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, I do not wish it to be considered that one need feel bound to adopt the alternative which he has laid before the House. I think he must allow us more time to consider the situation; and though I am sure, speaking for myself, that all the time I could give to it would not result in a more useful opinion than that arrived at by him, still if I do vote in favour of his Motion I am not prepared to say that 1 would therefore accept his alternative. I thank your Lordships for listening to me on this the first time I have really addressed the House and I have only to add that I cannot consider the position of the Territorial Forces in this country a satisfactory one without the prospect of adequate training.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01841"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SEMPILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with considerable interest to the debate on this question during the past two days, and I am sorry to see that the eloquence of noble Lords on this side of the House has not altogether produced the effect that I should have hoped on noble Lords opposite. At least that is my impression and if that is the case. I think I may say of the noble Viscount opposite, in his own words, that he is in the position of one who refuses to exchange his Consols for what we believe on this side of the House would be a better form of security. It is generally admitted that national defence is not a Party question, and we have on this side of the House given the noble Viscount all the support we can in trying to forward the Territorial scheme, for which we give him every credit. I have no doubt I may
<col>970</col>
say this further to the noble Viscount, that he possibly experiences an unpaternal feeling that this Territorial child shall develop into an <i>enfant terrible</i>. We only hope it may; but, admitting; that His Majesty's Government are not in any way to accept the scheme as propounded by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, which has received so much support on this side of the House, I think with that patriotism that is felt throughout your. Lordships' House we shall only be too glad to further assist the scheme which the late Under-Secretary of State for War has suggested should be given a further five years trial. I am not saying that I agree with that scheme, but, as I say, our patriotism will carry us forward to support it to the best of our ability.<lb/>
But it is not only the Territorial scheme that calls for our attention. When I look at the General Annual Report of the British Army for the current year, I notice that the Regular Army is wanting, to complete, 3,794 men; the Special Reserve requires 23,453 men, and the Territorial Force requires 45,526. A formidable array, my Lords ! I do not desire to criticise the scheme that at present exists, but I wish to try and indicate some means by which this shortage could be met. When I turn again to the Report I find that some 63,000 odd men presented themselves as recruits for the Regular Army, but at the bottom of the page where I see the words "Joined unit "I find that the total has dwindled down to 26,386. Those casualties are very heavy. I find that, roughly speaking, about 30,000 of those men who were ready to join the Regular Forces have been rejected for physical reasons. This is a conundrum that does not face the British Army alone. To what is it due? It is due apparently to physical deterioration. Even if these men were accepted in that state of physical deterioration, we are not likely at that age to make them sound and well. I would suggest to His Majesty's Government that a scheme of training for boys should be taken up, and there is no doubt that the earlier it is taken up the better. The longer you leave the cure of physical deterioration, the less likely you are to find a panacea for it.<lb/>
I have in my hand a scheme which is being advocated in Germany, a country from which we take so many ideas, and which is always being quoted, not only with regard to naval, but with regard to military and
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0511"/>
<col>971</col>
commercial matters. The scheme is called "The Care of the Youth." I will not trouble your Lordships by reading the whole of it, nor will I, knowing what a master of the German language the Secretary of State for War is, venture into that language. I will read one or two extracts. The first runs&#x2014;
<quote>"One of the most troublesome problems facing German social reformers is the lot of the youth who has been freed from the restraints of school, and who has not attained the age for entering the Army and undergoing any kind of discipline."</quote>
I think that largely describes our own position. In another part it says that between the ages of fourteen and twenty is the time when, from the point of view of both physical and moral development, discipline and care are most needed; and it adds that compulsory continuation schools, ceasing at seventeen, are nothing like universal in Germany. Then it says&#x2014;
<quote>"The idea of the Government is to start in every district in Prussia organisations for supplying secular instruction, recreation, sport, and religious and moral teaching, and members of these organisations will not be paid. They are to be local officials, teachers, municipal workers, and also private individuals."</quote>
We do a great deal of voluntary work in this country. Then in further describing what this youth care is they say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is to work towards the creation of a social and physical efficiency, moral excellence, a youth filled with a sense of solidarity, fear of God, and love of the home and Fatherland."</quote>
Noble words, my Lords, and words which I think express very much the speech of the German Chancellor only a few days ago.<lb/>
Finally, there are to be organisations and instruction in sports and athletics. Doctors, Judges, engineers and Army officers are requested to deliver special lectures, particularly military lectures, and emphasis is to be laid on heroic and patriotic deeds of individuals. Can we have more noble sentiments than these? These are the sentiments we want to inculcate into our youth. Let them think of their country. Do not let them all think merely of football. Think of 30,000 people attending a football match&#x0021; How many of them play themselves? We want men to play the game, and not merely to look on. Why should we not have a similar scheme for the instruction of our youth between fourteen and seventeen? It would get them largely over the drudgery of a soldier's life, because they would be inculcated with the feeling of discipline, the feeling of trying to be smarter than those alongside of them.<lb/>
<col>972</col>
That would get them over the drudgery to which reference has been made, and they would be released, as it were, from the recruit's drill in whatever branch of the service they might go. There are schemes in this country which are due, not to the action of the British Government, but to the extraordinary enterprise of private individuals.<lb/>
Look even in our own times how men like Mr. Cecil Rhodes have helped to make the Empire. Look at what Sir Baden Powell has done in starting the Boy Scout movement, and instilling into the youth of our country noble sentiments which every patriotic young man ought to hold. There is a certain amount of work done by means of physical instruction in our secondary educational system, and I was sorry to observe that the noble Viscount. Lord Halifax, who is such an eloquent advocate and is so well versed in all educational systems, should not have made some reference to it in his speech to-night. I think we ought to go a little further, and endeavour to make this physical instruction general. If some scheme of this kind was devised, instead of having something like 30,000 rejected as medically unfit out of 63,000 odd recruits, we should find we had not only sufficient recruits for our Regular Forces but that there would be a surplus, many of whom I hope would go to the Territorial Army. Many of your Lordships who have been in various branches of His Majesty's Service will know that the class of man you get in the Regular Army is perhaps not exactly the same class as you get in the Territorial Force. Therefore I am not taking too much credit in thinking that this scheme would bring a surplus of men, not alone for the Regular Army and the Special Reserve, but for the Territorial Force. That is a big question. and one that would require a good deal of thinking out, but I think it is worth it.<lb/>
May I deal now with some of the minor details which would help in some way, perhaps, to make up for the deficiency in numbers in our Territorial Force. As I have already said, quoting from the Annual Report, the Force is about 45,000 short. The scheme of His Majesty's Government of course, anticipates the possibility of certain contingencies, and I presume that the establishments are drawn up with a view to meet those contingencies; but if you are 45,000 men short in your last line of defence, I that is a serious matter. Instructions have
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0512"/>
<col>973</col>
recently been issued which will somewhat alter the position of sergeant-instructors in the Territorial Force. That question was fairly and fully entered into the other night, and I will only pause for one moment to say that I believe it is a mistake to send the sergeant instructor to the Territorial Force for a very short period, because he is required to make himself acquainted with the whole of a district. When a recruit goes to a recruiting sergeant, that recruit may be taken on there and then. The sergeant does not require to know much about him. But in the case of a sergeant-instructor the position is totally different. He wants to know all about the man and his family, and, in fact, has to "nurse" the district. To do that he must, so to speak, know every individual in it, and the characteristics of the various men who come forward to join the Territorial Force. Therefore I think it would be wiser that these sergeant-instructors should be appointed for, say, a period of five years, and the officers commanding units given the option of getting rid of them at a much shorter time should they prove in any way inefficient and not up to their duties. Another point with regard to these sergeant-instructors. We have been told by the War Office&#x2014;I speak as the chairman of a Territorial Association&#x2014;-that it is impossible for us to be allowed more than eight sergeant-instructors for an Infantry battalion. Why eight? Is it because there are eight colour-sergeants in the battalion? I suppose that is the answer I shall be given, but we must look at the enormous districts in the country. In the part I come from, one sergeant-instructor has to go perhaps five-and-twenty miles to an out section. How is it possible for him to look after a company spread over miles and miles of country, and make the men efficient?<lb/>
It is admitted by many of your Lordships who represent every branch of the Territorial Force that the material is excellent, but what is lacking is the training, and the facilities for training. That being the case, possibly your Lordships will forgive me if I make a sort of personal remark about the Association with which I am connected. I refer to one of these very scattered districts, a district in Aberdeenshire. The enthusiasm of one section of a company of the Gordon Highlanders was so great that the men themselves paid a sergeant-instructor to drill them. Surely these men, if they do that from a spirit of patriotism, are
<col>974</col>
worthy of some encouragement. In the case of forces below establishment, if an excellent sergeant-instructor will produce 50 or 100 men surely he is worth having. `Then as regards these sergeant-instructors I shall be told that on mobilisation they will be supernumeraries. I do not think so at all. If a battalion is mobilised, you naturally must have a regimental sergeant-major. One of these could perform those duties. Another might be appointed to be regimental quartermaster-sergeant; so I think that argument, assuming it to be made, will fall to the ground.<lb/>
Another thing to make the Territorial Force more popular is to better equip them with rifle ranges. As it is, men very often have to go eight or nine miles in country districts to do their firing. That does not encourage the men. I am sure chairmen of County Associations in this House will bear me out when I say that we meet with all sorts of obstacles in trying to acquire ground for rifle ranges. The matter of shooting is a great inducement to the men to join the Territorial Force, and a rifle range close at hand would increase that inducement. I think that very often the expenses of going to rifle ranges would be more than counterbalanced if the War Office could see their way to put ranges closer to hand, and so encourage men to join, and give them less trouble in going both to the rifle ranges and to their drills.<lb/>
We have heard a good deal in the last two days about the drudgery of a soldier's life. I do not want to make the Territorial Force any less efficient than it is, but there is no doubt some men fear the prospects of the drudgery of drill, though, after all, recruits' drill is not really the most essential part of the training of the Territorial Force, though it is important. Some men will master in twenty drills what others will take forty or fifty to learn. It would be a saving to the Government if the adjutant or the commanding officer could have power to dismiss a likely recruit his drills as soon as he has rendered himself efficient, in the same way that a recruit is dismissed his drills in the Regular Army. Many people will say that the Territorial Force is not worth the money that is being spent on it. That is a mistake, because the Territorial Force is really being run comparatively cheaply; you are getting the free services of County Associations with every goodwill. As I have said, I ant only too ready to assist the noble Viscount the Secretary of
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0513"/>
<col>975</col>
State for War in furthering his scheme, though at the same time I should have much preferred that His Majesty's Government had lent a more willing ear to the scheme that has been propounded by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal who sits on the Cross Benches. whose Motion I shall support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01842"><sup>*</sup><member> LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only venture to intervene for a few minutes in this debate as being a humble member of the Territorial Force with a few years' experience, although I do not for one moment presume to pose as an authority on this great subject. It is impossible not to sympathise with the noble and gallant Earl, Lord Roberts, who has continually brought this important and vital subject before the country, and I hope that his efforts may be crowned with the success that they deserve. This has been mentioned very often, and it would be unbecoming of me to enlarge upon it. At the same time, it is impossible for me to refrain from sympathising with some of the difficulties which beset the War Office authorities and the Secretary of State for War. Many difficulties surround this complex question. The War Office authorities may, of course, be open to criticism. I suppose they do not mind that; and if there are things which merit criticism they ought to be spoken of and testified to in the hope that they may be remedied. Difficulties are found on every side, and I think they can be divided into two main heads&#x2014;they are of a twofold nature.<lb/>
There is, first of all, the difficulty that by our laws not a single citizen can be called upon to lift one finger for the defence or interests of this country. And it must be remembered that England has more to lose than any other civilised country in the world; perhaps it is not an exaggeration to say that she has more to lose than most of the world put together. This has been already remarked upon, and it is a most extraordinary state of affairs which hardly obtains in any other civilised nation on the face of the globe. It is quite true that in spite of this, we have got on pretty well during our history and have a splendid record. None the less it is a source of danger, and it is a thing which must be seriously dealt with in the immediate future.<lb/>
The other great difficulty with which we have to contend, and to which it is
<col>976</col>
hard to refer without indulging in the language of indignation, is the wretched abuse of the Party system which is so rife in our time. In some part of Parliament do not refer to your Lordships' House&#x2014;it would really appear as if everything of importance were relegated to this wretched Party system; not that they should be debated on their merits, but discussed with a view to the ascendency of this or that Party. The public arc deceived; the truth is kept from them. Even this great and vital question seems to be getting a sort of bone of contention in the ignoble strife between the kites and the crows. That is one of the great dangers under which we labour, and certainly one of our chief difficulties in arriving at a solution as to what is best to be done with regard to our defensive force.<lb/>
My Lords, none of the various speakers has criticised the Regular Army as far as its efficiency is concerned. All that is complained of is that it is not strong enough, and that its numbers have been somewhat unduly reduced. There is a general consensus of opinion that it is as good and as efficient a force as it can be. What we have really to consider is the question of the Territorial Army, and 'also the Special Reserve that was formerly called the Militia, because it is on those two auxiliaries that we have to depend to supplement our Regular forces, which, as has been said, are extremely efficient, hut not quite as strong as we could wish. Many things have been said about the Territorial Force. It has been said that as a half-trained Force it might be a source of serious danger if we relied too much upon it. But at any rate there is this to be said, that we have got this Force. We have a large force of men, not indeed up to the numbers that were laid down by the War Office but still we have a force of between 250,000 and 300,000 men. Your Lordships will all remember the great difficulty of recruiting. The famous cookery recipe which instructed persons how to prepare a hare for dinner, began with the immortal words "First catch your hare." Those words, I think, might be engravers on some of the doors of the War Office, because upon that question the whole thing turns.<lb/>
So far, we have caught our hares in the Territorial Army. There may be some of them good, some indifferent; but at all events, there they are, a fine body of men in the prime of life. They are
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0514"/>
<col>977</col>
absolutely loyal&#x2014;I believe there is no question of that&#x2014;and they are extremely keen and desirous of doing their best as far as they possibly can. You have got them on your list. You can get at them at any time. You can, I suppose, trace them if they move from one part of England to another. At any rate this Force is better than nothing, because if you did not have your Territorial Force, you would certainly have to fall back upon people who were absolutely ignorant, men who have not had any training whatever. I do riot know what would happen with the Territorials in case we were unhappily involved in war. I suppose they would be immediately mobilised and trained as carefully as possible and would become a reservoir of partly-trained men to supply gaps in the Regular Army as circumstances would determine. If that view is taken, I think it would be always a good thing if the Territorial Force could be more in touch with the Regular Army during their small opportunities of training than they have been. I know that that is not very easy to work out, but cannot help thinking that the more they are brought in touch with the Regulars the better the Force will be. They would see a good example before them, and would get many more chances of becoming efficient than if left to themselves.<lb/>
In this connection I think we may rather deplore the idea sometimes supported that the Territorial Force should be regarded as an independent Force, and left only half-trained to take the field against the picked troops of a hostile Continental Power. That idea, of course, will not hold water for a moment. Such a course might unhappily be forced upon us were we driven into a corner. We might have to do the best we could, but for any Government; to pursue such a course as that as though there was no sort of alternative would be only courting the destruction of the Force itself, and very likely disaster to the whole country into the bargain. If I may venture upon a detail, although it is not my intention to go into details to night, I should like to mention one which I think goes rather to the root of the difficulties in the important question of training these men, and that is with reference to the annual camp. I think if the camps were made a little more instructive than they are at present, if they could have the services
<col>978</col>
of a certain number of Regular officers who could attend part of the time, not merely as spectators or umpires, but to help in the actual training, it would get over a considerable difficulty, and tend to save time in the matter of training.<lb/>
This view was put forward in a debate last year, and if I remember aright was not received with any very great favour. It. seemed to be the contention of the Government then that it was far better that the Territorial Force should be left; to themselves and to their own officers, that they should not have too much help, and that; they should work out their own salvation in their own uninstructed and ignorant way. But it so happened that when the battalion in which I have the honour to hold a small commission actually went into camp a short time afterwards, I found that there were two or three Regular officers attached to us who did exactly what I have suggested. They went with the men, superintended the training, and gave the great benefit of their experience and advice. I will give an instance. The company to which 1 belong was ordered out for special training, and the task set before us was to practise the attack on a neighbouring hill. One of the Regular officers came with us. First of all he rather deprecated doing anything, because he said he did not wish to take the command of the company out of the hands of its own officers. I told him that we had come to learn, and legged him to give us the full benefit of his assistance. He kindly showed us the proper disposition of the troops according to his idea, took an immense deal of pains and trouble, and superintended the movement. The movement was shortly afterwards carried out, and I need not say rather badly. He very kindly criticised what was wrong. There were mistakes which were very obvious when pointed out, but which I confess had escaped the observation of both myself and the other officers. The movement was repeated more than once, and at the end he was good enough to say that although there was a good deal to be desired, the thing on the whole was done fairly well. We all felt that we had learned far inure in a couple of hours, or whatever the time was, under his instruction, than we should have learned in six months if left, at to speak, to flounder about in our own ignorance, not knowing
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0515"/>
<col>979</col>
exactly what to do, and then to have the benefit of a more or less politely worded criticism at the end of the day and no further notice taken of it. This I consider is well worthy of the attention of the authorities, because it seemed to me to meet with marked success, and it was a very valuable help to the training of the men, which is in itself a great advantage in this extremely difficult and complex problem.<lb/>
The noble Lord who last spoke mentioned the question of sergeant-instructors of the Territorial Force, and wished to know why there were no more than eight sergeant-instructors allowed to one battalion. I do not know, but I suppose one reason is that there are usually eight. companies, and one instructor is allowed to each company. I have heard it suggested that the number of these valuable sergeant-instructors should be reduced. I earnestly hope that that will not be the case, but that, if possible, their number might be multiplied, because it is no exaggeration to say that upon the sergeant-instructors almost everything depends in the way of training the men individually and collectively when they first join, of bringing them up to a proper sense of their duties, and generally giving them every help and assistance.<lb/>
The question has been asked, What is really the good of discussing this matter? Will any great good come out of this debate? This is one of those questions which requires a moment's thought before answering, but I think after a little consideration we may safely answer it in the affirmative. The people of this country may not view with equanimity the question of compulsory service. They are evidently conservative in their nature, and look askance at any chance of a change of which they do not see the whole bearing. But how is the public to be instructed unless it is spoken to by people who take an interest in these questions, who have a knowledge of them, and who speak simply from a patriotic and not from any Party point of view? It is only by instructing the people gradually that they can be brought to see the rights of this question. Whether the Motion now before the House is going to be put to a Division or not, or whether the interests we all have at heart will be best served by a Division, of course I leave to wiser heads than my own to decide. But there can be no harm whatever in ventilating this subject, and I can only
<col>980</col>
say, and I am sure you will be inclined to agree with me, that the more this subject is ventilated from an independent point of view the better, and if the words that have been spoken in this debate do tend to elucidate this thorny question and bring the public into a proper frame of mind in regard to it, they will not have been spoken in vain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01843"><member>LORD SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a new member of your Lordships' House I crave your indulgence while I say a few words in this debate. From 1892 to 1905 as a Whip in the House of Commons followed the policy adopted by Whips on our side and did not take part in debate, and from 1905 until last year during which time I had the honour of filling the office of Paymaster-General I found that the work of my Department was so admirably conducted that it never lent itself to Parliamentary criticism; so that for nearly twenty years I have been a silent member of the House of Commons. But between 1882 and 1885 I had the honour of being Member for Colchester, and in that capacity I always took an active and lively interest in all military matters, and perhaps took more interest in that branch of the work which dealt with the non-commissioned officers and men than in any other in connection with the Army. As Paymaster-General. from 1905 until last year, it was my privilege to be Chairman of the Commissioners of the Duke of York's School, and as member for West Southwark, representing a poor district of London, it has been my privilege to work amongst the boys of that crowded area, and in that way I have seen the advantage of Lads' Brigades.<lb/>
I may commence by saying that I am a whole-hearted supporter of the Secretary of State for War in his very active and energetic work, and I rise now simply to make the suggestion that the question of Cadet Corps should receive his immediate and serious consideration. I cannot help thinking that Cadet Corps would be a splendid recruiting ground for the Army. We are told in this debate that it is very difficult to find recruits, and that their numbers are very short. I think that if the question of Cadet Corps were seriously entertained by the Secretary of State for War he would find a large recruiting field. The lads of our country, and especially the poor lads, should be induced to join Cadet Corps where they would be taught
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0516"/>
<col>981</col>
self-respect, discipline, and many other things that would be of advantage both to themselves and to the country. I am not suggesting that we should bring the youth of the country up in a military spirit. Boys leave the Board Schools at the age of fourteen. What are they to do with themselves between the ages of fourteen and, say, seventeen to eighteen? Could anything be better than Cadet Corps? I am not suggesting that in school hours they should have military instruction, but I think that after their schooling, between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, they might be more or less associated with their schools, and the schools might be made drill grounds for them. I have personal experience of this in connection with the poor in Mission Halls where the lads have been looked after and where this Lads' Brigade policy has been adopted.<lb/>
If you were to go to West Southwark to-night you would probably find in most of the Board School.- drilling going on by more or less rough lads, with rough clothes, perhaps, with a little shako, and with a belt across their breasts, proud and pleased to be drilled and looked after by voluntary officers. I am connected with a Cadet Corps which is perhaps well known to many of your Lordships and in which Miss Octavia Hill takes great interest., and that corps has many companies throughout London. I was chairman of the Southwark company, and I can say that those boys are more or less connected with the Army. I believe they appear in the Army List. It is a Cadet Corps very economically managed, with very cheap clothing, but still doing a useful work amongst these poor lads. On high days and holidays and when Royalty pays a visit to Southwark these boys turn out in their uniforms and with their band, and they have formed Guards of Honour. I have had the honour of representing that district in the other House for twenty-two years, and during that time I have perceived a marked improvement in the condition of the children there, and I attribute a great deal of that to the interest that has been taken in the way that I have suggested.<lb/>
Take, again, the Duke of York's School, one of the most admirable and useful institutions in this country. It is a school that I should like to see the Secretary of State for War developing. That school,
<col>982</col>
which used to be at Chelsea, is now removed to Dover, its splendid buildings covering 140 acres of ground, with every- possibility of development. I am sorry to say that because a Scottish school of a similar character has come into vogue with a number of boys, the Duke of York's School has been reduced in numbers. I would point out to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War that if he could develop the training of a number of boys in the Duke of York's School he would have growing up die best non-commissioned officers in the Army. It is really a Lilliputian army. If you have never been in that school and have never seen those boys, I would invite any of your Lordships if you happen to be in t he neighbourhood of Dover to go to the school and ask the commander to bring out the boys. You would then see what they can do, not only in the way of drill, but in the way of drilling others. They have their sergeant, and their corporals, and they give their orders in a way that would do credit; to any officer in the Army. I suggest that this is one way of encouraging the youth of the country. These boys of the Duke of York's School, I ought to mention, are not bound to go into the Army. Many go into civil life, but they turn out most useful soldiers if they join the Army. I would suggest also that every municipality in the country might have its Cadet Corps, and those again would be ground work for recruiting. 1 thought that I might venture to intrude these observations and make these suggestions, which I hope are of a practical character, to the Secretary of State for War, and I thank your Lordships for having given me this patient hearing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01844"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the special attention of the Secretary of State for War to one or two points which I think may possibly assist his object in having a large and efficient Territorial Force. The first is a point that materially affects recruiting. There is a serious grievance now in that there is no separation allowance for the young married private. The noble Viscount has recently made some increases in the grants, but there is no provision for that, and I honestly believe that if the Regulations could be changed so as to allow of some separation allowance being given to young married men, the noble Viscount would have the satisfaction of making a very great advance in recruiting.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0517"/>
<col>983</col>
The second point is a grievance as regards officers. The officers get no encouragement whatever to go to musketry, or to attend -any assembly of officers where a war-game is being carried out, because they have to pay their own travelling expenses. Out of the allowance grants the Associations may not at present make any allowance for these purposes, a serious matter to a great many officers. You are short of officers, and one of the reasons why you are short of officers is that you are throwing upon the officer an unfair amount of expense. If the Secretary of State for War would agree to look into that matter he might possibly induce a larger number of young men to take commissions. I understand that an Army Order has been issued this year to the effect that, in the case of Territorial officers going into a class, if they did not get a certificate they should not get the pay hitherto allowed them for the time they are at that class. If I am wrong, perhaps the noble Viscount will correct me. But if my information is correct it is extremely unfair. If a Regular officer is sent to the class and does not get a certificate, you do not dock him of his pay. The Territorial officer, however, is docked, and that is a discouragement to these young men. They are busy, their first business is in a civilian profession, and they probably utilise their holidays for 'the purpose of attending these classes. I hope the Secretary of State for War will give his attention to these two points if he wants gentlemen to take commissions more readily than they do now.<lb/>
The other point in connection with the Territorial Force about which I wish we had more information is as regards the classification and the registration of horses. I heard a part of the speech of the Secretary of State for War, and I gathered that he had got a scheme. As far as I remember the noble Viscount's speeches, which I think he will admit have been extremely numerous during the last two or three years on this subject, he has always had a scheme. He rather reminds me of our old friend James Lowther when Secretary for Ireland. He used to be constantly making speeches and saying that at the time the Conservatives retired he had actually a Bill in his pocket which was going to make Ireland the best country in the world. The Secretary of State for War has always had a scheme for horses, but he has been so proud of it, so pleased
<col>984</col>
with it, that he has never disclosed it. During the last two and a half or three years that this has been going on, we have never yet discovered what the noble Viscount's scheme is with regard to horses, and unless he has got one ready to come out I do not believe he is one iota further in his scheme for registration of horses or the distribution of horses on mobilisation than he was two years ago. This is a county grievance. Two years ago the County Association to which I belong sent up a scheme, and asked that it might be tried in one regiment. It ought to have appealed to the noble Viscount, because it was not going to cost one penny more than the present grant of &#x00A3;5 a horse which a Yeomanry regiment receives. No; they had got a very much better scheme of their own, and they would prefer to try that. That was two years ago, and it has not been tried.<lb/>
I suggest that occasionally the War Office might take a little advice from outside. Here was a very practical scheme which was not going to cost any more than the present arrangement, and under it a man was to know where his horse was during the twelve months. He would be able to lay his hand upon it at any time. Under any scheme suggested to us up to now by the War Office they always had a base, and there was to be a collection of horses in large numbers at some central place in the county. The first suggestion was that all the horses were to be collected at one central place in the county of Kent, and having been brought five-and-thirty miles from one place to the central place, a horse might have to be sent back five-and-thirty miles to find the man who was to ride it, or the cart into which it was to be put. I do suggest that the scheme we asked the noble Viscount to try was rather more practical than that, because every man in the regiment would have known where his horse was on the word of mobilisation coming round, so that all he had to do was to take his saddle to the horse. Those are points as regards the Territorial Army which 1 think might with advantage be considered by the Secretary of State for War.<lb/>
As regards the general question, I have only one or two words to say. I would not venture to detain your Lordships at any length to-night, because it is hardly possible to say anything new now. This
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0518"/>
<col>985</col>
debate has lasted a considerable time, and it has been treated from many points. If the Motion proposed by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal goes to a Division I shall support him; but I am very much in the position Lord Derby is in&#x2014;I am unable to agree wholly with either side. I have taken part in too many debates on military matters to accept altogether the lurid colours in which the condition of the country and the condition of the Army is painted by one side; and upon the other side I am very doubtful, if the political pendulum were to swing and the Party that I support came into power, whether they would make very material changes in the Army system. I had the honour of representing the War Office in this House for four years, and I have five-and-thirty years experience of what is now the Territorial Force, and that is the result of my experience of many debates and much administration. But I do venture to point out to the Secretary of State for War that he has pinned his faith upon the Territorial Force and upon its being of sufficient numbers and efficient. Well, I think he must know that as regards numbers it is perilously near a failure. He is not getting the numbers that he expected, and I am very much afraid that in the next twelve months he will find that, notwithstanding the beating of the drum that is going round, notwithstanding the efforts and the influence of those to whom he has appealed&#x2014;influence which is very much decried by many members of his Party in other niatters&#x2014;notwithstanding the influence that is being brought to bear, the Territorial scheme is not going as successfully as he and all of us hoped. If that is so, I do not see that there is any alternative but a system of compulsory service for home defence.<lb/>
I am consistent in this, for I voted for it last year, and I see no reason to change my opinion now. I believe it is the best thing for the country. I believe it would make a great deal of difference to our young men. I think that the habit of discipline would have an educational effect upon many classes which would be distinctly advantageous for the country, and therefore I do not take altogether the hopeless position that some people do. I am a believer in a system of national and military training, and I live in hopes of seeing it come some day. I think the Secretary of State for War has got to recognise that
<col>986</col>
he is getting very near that. I think he will admit that the Association of which I am a member has done what he asked it to do upon the old grant. That is a fact, and we have nothing to grumble about. The new grant is so much more in our pockets, but for all our success as regards economy we cannot see that we are increasing the popularity of the Territorial Force.<lb/>
As far as the Yeomanry is concerned, they have nothing to thank the Secretary of State for. He has ill-treated them in every way he could, but, as is their custom. they have ignored that and have responded with the utmost loyalty to what he has asked of them. But as regard, the Infantry and the Artillery, the thing is not going; and I venture to suggest one or two points in which he might help to get a quicker move. Failing that, I cannot see any result for this country but to admit a system of compulsory military service for home defence. Last night the Secretary of State for War told us it was generally recognised by foreign countries that it was impossible to have the two things together&#x2014;that voluntary service and compulsory service for home defence were impossible together. He supported that by saying that that was the opinion of many distinguished Continental officers. But are they particularly good judges of what. England can do, or of what is suitable for England? I very much doubt it. We. are quite as good judges in our humble way as those distinguished Continental officers. If the Territorial scheme does not go, what is the noble Viscount going to fall back upon? I venture to say that the safest thing to fall back upon is that which was advocated by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal last year and is still advocated by a good many of my noble friends on this side of the House. At any rate, I have never seen any reason why I should change my opinion. It would not only be a good thing from the military point of' view, but an admirable thing from the civilian point of view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01845"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CRANBROOK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as chairman of a County Association I feel I have hardly a right to support the noble and gallant Field-Marshal without giving a reason why I do so. I am chairman of the County Association to which Lord Harris has referred, and which I think the Secretary of State for War will admit
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0519"/>
<col>987</col>
has done its duty to the very best of its power, and has been on the whole rather an example to other County Associations. I have felt that the country has been greatly indebted to the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, more for the introduction of the Territorial system than any change in the Army regulations. During my comparatively long life, and it is now more than fifty years since I joined the Army, nothing so important was done. I consider that the Territorial Force is as superior to the old Volunteers as is the Regular Army to the Territorials. We have an organisation which I will not say is perfect, but it is very satisfactory, and we find that those who do join are willing and able to make highly satisfactory soldiers if not all that we could wish.<lb/>
But I regret to say I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to keep up the numbers of the Territorial Force, and I am convinced that, if we are to be safe at home, instead of our numbers becoming less they should become greater. We should have at least 500,000 men in the Territorial Army. Therefore I reluctantly come to the conclusion that without some form of compulsory service it will be impossible to keep up the numbers of the Territorial Force. The two next years are very serious, and I am quite convinced you cannot get the increased numbers anticipated by the Secretary of State for War in spite of his increased liberality. I do not quite agree with what Lord Harris said on that subject. We had not been able to look after the proper equipment of our Infantry, but in consequence of the increased grants we decided that the whole of the Infantry should be put in proper equipment. That is one of the advantages of the liberality to the Territorial service. But I have come to the conclusion that we cannot make the popularity of the service so great that it will be able to keep up its numbers.<lb/>
Then I ask myself whether there is any injustice done to the people of this country in calling upon them to make the small sacrifice&#x2014;I do not believe it would be any sacrifice&#x2014;which would be required. The children of the working man are being fed and educated, old age pensions are given, and the means of getting employment are found, and there is the suggestion of the provision of insurance against unemployment. Is it any grievance that the State should ask the working man, not by himself but with the other members of the community
<col>988</col>
&#x2014;all classes&#x2014;to do his best to save his country from the attacks of an enemy? A great grievance of the working man is want of employment. If you were to take away 100,000 men every year to train them, that would give them useful employment for the benefit of their country, and it would take them out of the labour market for the time being. In my opinion we should find that the people of this country who had had twelve months' service would be far and away the best men as workmen. I know that in the north of England the services of men who have been in the Army or the Navy are preferred, because those men are all the better for the discipline they have been taught. I consider that for the benefit of all in this country we are bound to have a compulsory system of service, and the sooner it comes the better for the nation. I shall, therefore, support the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01846"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Motion before you Lordships is of a wide character, and the discussion has been of a somewhat discursive nature, but full of interest. I do not agree with the remark of my noble friend beside me that nothing new has been said upon the subject. As far as I am concerned. I certainly have nothing new to say upon it, because I long ago exhausted all the originality I possessed in making speeches in the country upon this question. But however that may be, the debate has at all events enabled the Secretary of State for War to make one of those eloquent optimistic, and complacent statements which have done so much to reassure our fellow countrymen. Whether the noble Viscount looks at the question of national defence from the point of view of international politics, from the point of view of the Navy, or from the military point of view, he finds the prospect equally reassuring and agreeable.<lb/>
The noble Viscount holds the agreeable, but in my opinion pernicious, theory that the real military and naval arbiter in this country is the Foreign Secretary. If that were so, I only wish the Foreign Secretary were my noble friend Lord Curzon, because I know he is deeply committed to the principle of universal service. But when the noble Viscount asserts, as he did yesterday, that armaments are governed by policy. I cannot help expressing the opinion that he is uttering a complete fallacy. I was for some years myself in the Diplomatic
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0520"/>
<col>989</col>
Service, and my experience goes to convince me that the exact contrary is the truth, and I think without any trouble I can adduce instances in favour of my contention. For instance, in the year 1898 a serious crisis arose between this country and France with regard to the question of Fashoda. That crisis came to an end in what way? The crisis was terminated in consequence of the fact that the French realised that they were no match for us at sea. I will take another instance. During the Transvaal War, as everybody knows&#x2014;we know it upon the most august authority&#x2014;an attempt was made to form a European coalition against this country. That coalition came to grief, as everybody also knows, because no foreign country was prepared to lose its Fleet in the event of a war with us.<lb/>
And there is another instance which occurs to my mind. Only two years ago there was an acute European crisis caused by the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria. What happened then? That question was not in the least decided upon its merits, but when war appeared almost inevitable peace was secured simply by the fact that the German Government intimated to the Russian Government that they were prepared to stand by their allies. I maintain that it would be very easy to show that all such instances in recent European history have never been decided according to the merits, but by a threat of force. The noble Viscount, holding an entirely opposite view, surveys both hemispheres, and he sees nothing which is not good. I gather from his statement made yesterday&#x2014;and he, of course. is in a position to know&#x2014;that everybody is so fond of us at the present moment that there is not the least intention on the part of anybody to put us to any trouble or inconvenience at all. Why, says the noble Viscount, we are on the point of concluding a Treaty of Arbitration with the United States ! Therefore we may, of course, at once rule out the United States from the number of possible antagonists. We have, he says an Agreement with the French, a sort of blood-brotherhood weapon. We have also an Agreement with the Russians, and, as if that were not sufficient, supposing any unfortunate incident occurred to interfere with that Agreement we have an alliance with the Japanese, a simpleminded people who, although au island Power, yet nevertheless hold that it is necessary to develop their military as well as their naval resources.<lb/>
<col>990</col>
Then we come to another potential enemy&#x2014;Germany. But the Germans, according to the view of the Secretary of State for War, are a sort of country cousins of our own, and there is not the slightest danger likely to be incurred at their hands, because they have announced that they are willing to exchange information with us with regard to naval preparations, though what consolation anybody could derive by assurances of that kind is beyond,, my comprehension altogether. Supposing I were preparing for a race or a contest with another noble Lord, it would not be any consolation to me to know how much lie was eating a day or how much weight he was putting on. H the political and the international position is thus entirely reassuring, the military and naval position as regards ourselves is not less so. We have had many reassuring optimistic statements made to us in the course of the last few years. It was not so very long ago that the Prime Minister assured us that the invasion of this country was an impossibility. The First Lord of the Admiralty announced that a boat's crew could not land upon our shores, without his express permission. A little later on grudging admission was made by the Admiralty that under peculiar circumstances as many as 5,000 men might possibly land upon these shores, and subsequently a distinguished naval authority, a member of this House, advised us to sleep quietly in our beds and pay no attention to the warnings of the National Service League or other foolish institutions of that kind. The noble Viscount followed his advice so implicitly that he wakened up and the country wakened up before long to discover that the two-Power standard had practically slipped from our grasp.<lb/>
Then we had an admission that under certain circumstances a force of 70,000 men might land in this country. But the present position is apparently infinitely superior to what it was then, because, according to the statement of the Secretary of State for War yesterday. the Admiralty have expressly asserted that invasion is an absolute impossibility. And Lori Haldane, I observe, in a speech which he made the other day, used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"We are equipped to meet all emergencies, and the person who contends that we are not is in a blue funk."</quote>
Well, we are going to translate "blue funk" into Parliamentary language. The
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0521"/>
<col>991</col>
Parliamentary language I take it which we are going to employ for the purpose is that, under the leadership of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts, we are going to express "grave and growing concern" on account of our present military situation, and as far as I am concerned that Motion does not in the least meet my own requirements. I should much prefer to vote for something more definite than that. I feel very little relieved in expressing my grave and growing concern at the inadequate military arrangements of His Majesty's Government for the defence of this country and the oversea Dominions, because that is a feeling I have experienced for a considerable time.<lb/>
What is it that has placed us, according to the noble Viscount, in this absolutely invulnerable position? It takes a great deal of clear thinking, but I realise it at last. The solid fact which places us in this perfectly invulnerable position is the possession of the Territorial Force. The Territorial Force is the glittering bait, a sort of military siren which is going to lure to his inevitable doom the invader who is going to make an attempt upon this country. It appears that any one who is senseless enough to attack this country is doomed to inevitable failure and disaster. If he comes in small detachments, he is cut to pieces&#x2014;on paper&#x2014;by Sir Ian Hamilton and the Territorial Force. If, on the other hand, he decides to come in a body amounting to 70,000, then lie is annihilated by Sir Arthur Wilson. The only comment that I have to make upon this peculiar position, and upon the question of our absolute invulnerability is this: It seems to me rather a curious thing that, in view of this abnormal arid extraordinary position, the Secretary of State for War and his friends are doing their utmost to invite all the counties in this country to form themselves into ambulance associations under the auspices of the Red Cross. The only inference which I can draw from this incitement is that the noble Viscount has not quite the same confidence in his own scheme which he would like us to think.<lb/>
Now, I am bound to confess that I think the noble Viscount has a distinct grievance. Whereas he is being constantly subjected to an enormous amount of criticism, a great deal of this criticism appears to me to be of a purely destructive character,
<col>992</col>
I am afraid that I must state as an example of the destructive critic my noble friend behind me, the Duke of Bedford. There is nothing my noble friend enjoys more than pulling to pieces the schemes of the noble Viscount by showing that his figures are all wrong, that his men are boys, and that his boys are counted several times over. At the same time I feel bound to add that my noble friend has never suggested any remedy for this appalling condition of things except one. I remember that a year or two ago he suggested that Lords Lieutenant should come to the rescue of the country and put its military system upon a sound foundation. Well, readers of Lord Beaconsfield's novels will remember a gentleman who had a scheme in his mind by which the baronets of this country were going to regenerate the British Empire. The suggestion of my noble friend has been adopted; the Lords Lieutenant have been tried; and I think it is not the Lords Lieutenant's fault that they have been found wanting and have not been able to succeed in creating a national Army and a national force, which, upon the whole, is not very surprising.<lb/>
But I am bound to add, although I feel I am doing almost more for the Secretary of State for War than lie deserves, that the criticism from the Opposition Front Bench is also of a somewhat arid and unproductive character. If we could be guaranteed that supposing a change of office were to take place Lord Curzon and Lord Milner were to be members of the Administration, we might confidently expect a radical change in our military administration; but as it is I, like my noble friend behind me, do not entertain any great expectation that supposing by some extraordinary chance a change of Government took place there would be any startling change in our military system. Noble Lords on the Front Opposition Bench are hardly candid in this way. They have never put forward any real alternative to the noble Viscount's proposal, and until they do suggest something else I shall continue to believe that if they came into office they would only continue to do what he has been doing. If I were in the position of the Secretary of State for War I confess I should not pay very much attention to criticism of this nature. I should pay attention to serious criticism, the criticism of persons like myself&#x2014;and I say this in a perfectly
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0522"/>
<col>993</col>
serious spirit&#x2014;who have really got an alternative to offer in the shape of universal and compulsory service.<lb/>
We serious people have a grievance, and a real grievance, against the noble Viscount. Our grievance is that, chiefly by his own merits and by his own talents, he has succeeded in persuading an enormous number of his countrymen that they have got something totally different from what they had before. In view of the limitations of time I cannot say as much on this as I should like, and I desire to keep my remarks as short as I can. But put shortly the situation amounts to this, that the noble Viscount has distinctly failed in his endeavour to create a national Force. When you are discussing military questions -on broad grounds like this I never think it is very much use dwelling too much upon the subject of the Regular Army, because, as I say, if the Opposition came into power again the changes which they would introduce would amount to very little. If you are going to introduce any radical change in our military system there is only one direction in which you can do it, and that is in regard to your Territorial Force.<lb/>
Now, the Secretary of State for War has, in my opinion, missed his opportunity, and the crucial fact remains that with all his influence, talents, and industry, and despite the assistance which he has received from persons professing all sorts of political opinions, he has failed in the crucial point of getting the numbers which he requires. He asked for 315,000 men&#x2014;not an extravagant number, considering the population of these islands. He has not got that number, and he knows perfectly well he never will get it; and I appeal in corroboration of my statement to what has appeared under the name of the man who has done perhaps more than anybody else, next to the noble Viscount, for the Territorial Force&#x2014;namely, Lord Esher. He has plainly intimated that the game is up; that these men cannot: be obtained. And he has also pointed out that numbers are everything, and if you cannot get the numbers no amount of rhetoric, no amount of organisation, no amount of clear thinking, will supply these deficiencies. We have got to face that fact. I would also add that if you cannot find the numbers it is not much use bringing forward testimonials to the value of the Territorial Force,
<col>994</col>
whether those testimonials proceed from Sir Ian. Hamilton or from Generals in flights of <i>post-prandial</i> oratory at the Defence Association, or from that much quoted gentleman, Colonel Repington.<lb/>
I should like to ask the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, whether he attaches any particular importance to Colonel Repington's opinion. I understand that he does. That being so, I will ask him to pay particular attention to an extract that I propose to read. It is an extract from the much-quoted authority whom we all know so well by this time. Colonel Repington said&#x2014;
<quote>"Every Statesman who from this time forward neglects to advocate national training as a public duty will assuredly deserve the maledictions of posterity, and every citizen who combats or delays the introduction of this indispensable reform deserves to be described as a public enemy and will richly deserve the worst fate that can befall him."</quote>
I have never said anything half so unkind as that of the noble Viscount and I hope that I never shall, but all the same it seems to me to express, in somewhat rough language, what is absolutely true, and I do not know why we should conceal the fact. The fact is, we have arrived at what I am sick of hearing called the parting of the ways. Everybody knows perfectly well in their hearts that there is only one possible remedy, only one thing which will alter your military system, and that is the adoption of compulsion for the Territorial Force. Nobody in his senses, not even I, would advocate compulsion if voluntary effort could meet the deficiency; but unfortunately we have arrived at a time, like every nation does, when voluntary effort is not equal to the tasks imposed upon it.<lb/>
We owe more, perhaps, than any other nation to voluntary effort, but the time has come when voluntary effort is unable to do what we require of it. Voluntary effort provides us with the work of the magistracy and local government, and provides Members for the House of Commons. Up to now it has also provided Members for this House, and it is not necessary to have recourse to compulsion in order to recruit this House, whatever may be the case in the future. But the leading instance in this country where voluntary effort proved inadequate was the case of education; and just as in 1870 it was realised that the voluntary system
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0523"/>
<col>995</col>
was inadequate for the purposes of education, so now in 1911 it ought to be realised by every reasonable person that voluntary effort is no longer equal to the purposes of national defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01847"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am really reluctant to add one more to the long and almost uninterrupted line of speakers who have addressed your Lordships on this subject from this side of the House. I say almost uninterrupted, because the sequence has only been broken to-night by Lord Southwark, whom I remember very well in the old days in the House of Commons though I do not think I ever had the pleasure of entering the Lobby with him while we were Members there together, and whose advent to this House has had to-night the result, as agreeable to us as it is evidently to him, that it has removed from his lips the gag which, as he told us. rested uneasily there for twenty years in another place.<lb/>
I cannot claim to have any of that military knowledge or experience which has justified the remarks of so many of the noble Lords who have addressed this House. But, on the other hand, I think I may say that this is not either purely or even mainly a naval or military question. It is a political, a diplomatic, an administrative, and, above all, an Imperial question, and as such any member of your Lordships' House, even a layman, is, I think, not committing an act of presumption if he says something on the matter. We have had a number of very interesting speeches this evening on different branches of Army administration. Some of them have raised rather small points which must have almost reminded the noble Viscount opposite of a debate on Army Estimates in the House of Commons. Others of them, like the speech to which we have just listened, have been the humorous and witty expressions of the views entertained by their authors. But surely I am not wrong in saving that a good many of them have wandered rather widely from the large and enormous issues which were in reality raised by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts. This has in truth been a useful debate, but perhaps its most remarkable feature has been the speech which opened it.<lb/>
Let me recall to the memory of the House what happened yesterday. At the com-
<col>996</col>
mencement of our proceedings we saw the first soldier of the Empire standing at the Table and not for the first time addressing your Lordships in grave and measured tones, equally free from panic and from passion, stating to this House his assured conviction, resting upon an experience absolutely unequalled among the commanders of this land, that the military forces of this country are inadequate both for the defence of the Empire abroad and for the protection of our shores from invasion at home. One by one Lord Roberts took the different constituents of our Army, Regular and Auxiliary, and subjected them to a searching and deadly analysis. He showed that whatever the zeal and valour and spirit by which they may be animated, they are in his opinion not fitted for war, or I at any rate for the particular kind of war which we may have to contemplate in the future. He argued to us&#x2014;and who could argue with greater authority?&#x2014;that already the lessons of the South African war are being forgotten. He told us that after ten years of experiment and of effort&#x2014;and free homage has been rendered in the course of this debate to those who have initiated those experiments and made those efforts&#x2014;that after ten years of all this the Regular Army is 30,000, if not 40,000, less than it was ten years ago&#x2014;[A NOBLE LORD: No.] Well, I have not time to go into the figures, but I believe they are capable of being sustained. He told us also that the j Special Reserve had replaced the Militia, and that the Special Reserve is 28,000 less in numbers than the old Militia; and that the place of the Volunteers has been taken by the Territorial Force, greatly superior in organisation to that which it has succeeded, but inferior in numbers, insufficient in training, and undoubtedly more expensive in cost.<lb/>
The noble and gallant Field-Marshal told us, further, that in total strength and in. readiness to take the field&#x2014;and I think this was the gravest point he made&#x2014;he believed' we were no better off than we were at the commencement of the Boer campaign. After thus demonstrating to his satisfaction that we have neither a serious Army for the purposes of our Empire abroad nor a serious Home Army for the defence of these islands, he concluded by an appeal to His Majesty's Government that these allegations should be inquired into, not by a Royal Commission or any such form of investigation, but by a committee of qualified experts who should
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0524"/>
<col>997</col>
inquire into the truth of his allegations, and before whom, I take it, he and others would be prepared to give evidence. That is the nature of the case that has been submitted to your Lordships. I may have failed to remember anything that was said upon the subject of this suggested inquiry in the speeches from the Front Bench opposite, but I think no notice whatever has been taken of that serious appeal made by Lord Roberts. I believe his views are shared by the great majority of expert military and naval opinion in this country; certainly by the great majority of military commanders. They have been endorsed in this debate by the authority of a great number of noble Lords speaking from intimate personal knowledge on the subject. They were supported to-night in the powerful and comprehensive speech made by the late Secretary of State for War, Viscount Midleton.<lb/>
What sort of reply have we had to this serious and formidable indictment? I think we might have expected from noble Lords opposite not merely an answer to the individual charges, if that is not too strong a word to apply, but a reasoned defence of our military system in all its various branches. What I should have liked to have heard still more was some examination of the strategic needs of the Empire as a whole, and the degree in which the various forces of the Crown are adjusted or capable of being adjusted to those needs. But we have had nothing of the kind. The noble and gallant Field-Marshal has recently brought out a book, assisted by two collaborators, in reply to a volume which appeared under the distinguished patronage of the noble Viscount opposite. This book consists of two or three parts, for one of which the noble and gallant Field-Marshal is explicitly responsible, but the Secretary of State for War appears to have thought that Lord Roberts was equally responsible for Part II. Had the noble Viscount looked attentively at the volume he would have seen on page 158 a foot-note in which the noble and gallant Earl expressly dissociates himself from the authorship of Part II, or from sympathy with all that is there written. I may say for my own part&#x2014;and I am a Vice-President of the National Service League&#x2014;that I never saw this article until two days ago. I was unaware of the name of this author until this afternoon, and a good many of the proposals which it contains, while they represent the views of a
<col>998</col>
very talented and accomplished writer, must not be held in any way to commit the National Service League, and certainly do not commit the noble and gallant Field-Marsh al.<lb/>
And yet the noble Lord opposite, ignoring the speech which Lord Roberts did make, proceeded to reply to a Memorandum which he did not write. A little later in the afternoon we had a speech from Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, and he taunted and twitted the noble and gallant Field-Marshal for not having either in outline or detail produced an alternative scheme at all. What an absurd position we are therefore in: one noble Lord opposite attacking the noble and gallant Earl for not producing a scheme, and the Secretary of State for War attacking him for a scheme which he did not produce. The. noble Earl cannot, under our rules of debate, reply for himself this evening; but if he could I am certain he would say this, that it would have been entirely irrelevant for him to have introduced any scheme either in outline or in detail at present. He is asking for an inquiry. If an inquiry were granted he would be quite ready to state his views before it. What his general views are is not a matter entirely bidden from this House. His views are so well known that the Secretary of State for War has thought it necessary to take the unusual step of bringing out a book in order to answer them.<lb/>
What has been the general line of defence taken by speakers on the Front Government Bench? The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War endeavoured to reassure us by telling us that we are at the beginning of a new era in which pacific intentions animate the great Statesmen of the world, and, as my noble friend Lord Newton has just pointed out, he even quoted, I might almost say with some audacity, the speech of the German Chancellor in proof of his proposition. He then went on to argue that we should indeed set a terrible and unfortunate example to the world if, at a time when these happy ideas are in the air, we showed any particular desire to look after ourselves. Now, there is not a member on this side of the House who does not welcome the speech made by Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, in the House of Commons, the other day. We warmly welcome the idea of arbitration with the United States of America, either upon a restricted or still better upon an open and unrestricted field.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0525"/>
<col>999</col>
But it is not by the United States of America that we ever run the risk of being invaded in these islands, or indeed in any part of the world except Canada, and there we regard invasion as an unthinkable proposition. For my own part, I should wait to see an Arbitration Treaty concluded between ourselves and some great Continental State, or even between any two great Continental States, before I could dispense myself from feeling any apprehension or alarm; but I should like to record my conviction that in any negotiations into which we might enter with such an object, we should stand a very much better chance of success if it were known that we had an adequate force behind us, and that we were not so feeble as to be trifled with or ignored in any diplomatic negotiations that might ensue.<lb/>
There was another remark made by the Secretary of State for War to which I ask his permission to allude. He indulged in what I cannot help thinking was a very dangerous fallacy. He said that the true commander of the naval and military forces in this country is the Foreign Secretary, and that upon him depends what our policy is to be. I dispute this proposition <i>in toto</i>. The heads of the Army and Navy in this country cannot shelve their responsibilities on to the shoulders of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Whatever the skill or diplomatic ability which he may employ, he is powerless without the sanction of the military and naval forces behind him. The Foreign Secretary in this country is in exactly the same position as Moses in the battle with the Amalekites. His two hands have to be held up by the Ministers for the Army and the Navy; and if they fail in their duty and let his arms drop to his side, the Foreign Secretary loses all power and force. The idea that the responsibility is not theirs but is his, is one which, as an old official of the Foreign Office, I must be allowed respectfully to dispute.<lb/>
What are the positions which we claim to have established in this debate? I should like to deal with them under the two heads. We have, in the first place, a Regular Army which, for zeal and efficiency and patriotism, I believe is the equal of any Regular Army of similar or even greater size in any country in the world. But our case about it is that the Regular Army is painfully small in point of numbers, and that it possesses no means of expansion
<col>1000</col>
such as it might require in the event of a long and troublesome campaign. We have an Expeditionary Force of 170,000 men on paper for service across the seas. I have listened very attentively to all that has been said in this debate about the Expeditionary Force, and I own that I have been very much alarmed at what I have heard about the shortage of officers, admitted by the Secretary of State for War himself last night, and the deficiency of horses. I wonder very much&#x2014;I wish the noble Viscount were going to reply, because I might then get an answer to this question&#x2014;I wonder how soon he thinks that after the outbreak of hostilities or the occurrence of trouble in India the whole of this Force could be despatched from these shores. Could he spare it all? How long could it be maintained relatively intact in the country to which it was sent, and, still more, how when it began to dwindle under the inevitable stress of campaign would he succeed in replenishing it from the resources left in this country? I put my observations, not in the form of statements or charges, but in the form of a question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01848"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: As I am asked a question, I may say that one of the arrangements which I believe we have made is this, that the Force can be mobilised very rapidly. I do not wish to give the exact number of this Force, but the officers are all there, and there is also machinery and provision for keeping up and repairing the wastage, and keeping the Force in existence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01849"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to hear that reply, but I confess I should like to know what the machinery is. This is a point on which we on this side of the House are very apprehensive. Many of us are very much afraid that the Expeditionary Force might never go out; that circumstances might exist in this country in which it would be unsafe to allow it to leave our shores. But that was not my point. Supposing it did go, I am indeed glad to learn that without detriment to the Territorial Force here and without detriment to those Regulars left in this country, by whom the Secretary of State for War has more than once told us the Territorial Force is to be stiffened in the event of invasion, an adequate supply to meet the diminution can be obtained. But the Secretary of State for War more than once last night endeavoured to
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0526"/>
<col>1001</col>
reassure us by another observation. He told us that we have an enormous Army. That is a description that he has more than once employed&#x2014;that we have the largest overseas Army in the world. Of course we have, because we have the largest Overseas Empire in the world. Obviously our Army must be suited to the requirements of the Empire, and the question is not whether that Army is large, nor whether it is larger than the forces of other countries that have no Empire corresponding to our own. The question is two-fold&#x2014;first, is it large enough for what it may have to do, and, in the second place, is it as large as any foreign country&#x2014;Germany for instance&#x2014;would be content with in the same circumstances? If Germany possessed the Indian Empire, for instance, would she be content with an Expeditionary Force of 170,000 men?<lb/>
I own I have been very much struck in this debate by the extent to which the Imperial aspect of the question has been ignored. Let me ask your Lordships to look at the Imperial aspect of the case. During the last fifty years, since the Cardwell system was introduced, while the organisation of our Army has not been substantially altered, and whatever alteration there has been has been in the direction of improvement, a vast and enormous change has passed over the rest of the world. All the great European States have adopted Conscription. They now possess armies amounting to millions of men, which may be said to contain the armed manhood of those nations. Simultaneously, almost without our knowledge if not behind our backs, our Empire has been swelling and extending in every portion of the globe. Compare India as it was at the time of the Mutiny with what it is now. Look at Africa. In Africa alone in the last twenty years there has sprung up an Empire larger than that of India itself. These Empires that we have acquired are not islands which can be maintained and defended by sea power alone. They are shut in and enveloped by the territories of foreign States, and no one knows better than the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, who has resumed for the time the duties of Secretary for India, that in India we have not to deal merely with the relatively feeble States of Persia and Afghanistan and Turkey and Siam or even China, but in India we are co-terminous with the great European Powers of Russia and France; and though our relations with those two
<col>1002</col>
Powers are at the moment of a friendly character, and we all hope that this will last, nobody can say that the situation is free from all risk in the future.<lb/>
Take the case of Africa. In Africa we do not merely rub shoulders with naked and unarmed savages. Our territories there are co-terminous with those of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and France. All this means an enormous addition to our responsibilities, but simultaneously there has been scarcely any corresponding increase in our forces. Further I would observe that this is not merely a question of external and territorial expansion. Grave problems are rising that may involve, as nobody knows better than the noble Viscount, internal troubles too. If trouble of a serious character were to break out in Europe, which of us can guarantee that India will preserve a surface of unruffled calm? And if internal trouble were to break out in India, which of us can be certain that European Powers might not seize that opportunity to advance hostile and inconvenient claims? In those circumstances sea power cannot avail you. Sea power cannot save India. Sea power, it is true, can prevent any European State from conveying an armed force to India. It can save India from invasion from any great State except Russia, but it cannot put clown internal rebellion in India. It would be useless for that purpose. Therefore when you are discussing the issues placed before you by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal you have very anxiously and seriously to consider the enormous addition to your responsibilities which you have unthinkingly assumed, and which, although you may be able to discharge them from day to day, might at a moment of crisis place upon you a burden under which you would break down.<lb/>
There is one branch of this subject to which I will only allude in passing, and that is the subject which was so powerfully dealt with by my noble friend Lord Milner. I mean the question of the Balance of Power. I mention this subject both for its intrinsic importance and because it ought not to be altogether shirked by any speaker in this debate. I do not take quite so high a view of the matter as Lord Milner did last night. No one, I imagine, now contemplates as at all likely that British forces will at any time in the future conduct campaigns on the Continent of Europe on the scale they did in the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0527"/>
<col>1003</col>
seventeenth, eighteenth, or even in the early part of the nineteenth century. Certainly no idea of that kind fills the mind of any Statesman of any Party in this country. That by way of qualification and of caution. But, nevertheless, the doctrine of the Balance of Power, by which I understand the resolve to prevent any dangerous predominance by any individual Power on the Continent, is still, so far as I know, part of the accepted policy of this country. It certainly has never been repudiated by any Secretary of State, and would, I believe, be acknowledged by the present Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey. So long as that doctrine forms part of our policy, it is conceivable that occasions might arise on which, in fulfilment of a treaty obligation, or to succour an ally, or for the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>, or in defence of our own position, we might require to give assistance by military aid and not by the Navy alone. I do not put it higher than that; but for such a purpose it seems to me that we require an Army which is not absolutely negligible and which may assist the Foreign Secretary in any negotiations in which he may be concerned.<lb/>
But I confess that I am far more concerned in the question of the defence of India and our Overseas Dominions than I am in the question of the balance of power in Europe. I think two contingencies arise which we must consider. The first is the contingency which I mentioned just now and to which the Secretary of State for War replied, that you may be able to despatch the Expeditionary Force, but that after it has gone out and begun to waste you may not have behind in this country the resources from which it could be replenished; and the second contingent is that you might not be able to send out your Force at all owing to the admitted inferiority of the forces on which you are depending for the defence of this country. In such a case I shudder to think of what might happen. How would you deal with a case arising in India which could only be met by the despatch of the Expeditionary Force, if the Expeditionary Force were unable to leave this country, not because you did not trust in your Fleet, but because a powerful European enemy threatened and you could not trust your Territorial Army? That is why I look with so much alarm, not merely upon the inadequate numbers of our Regular Army, but upon
<col>1004</col>
the appallingly inadequate training and equipment of our Defence Army at home.<lb/>
Before I sit down I may, perhaps, be allowed to say a word or two about this Home Army. A little earlier in the evening we had an interesting speech from my noble friend Lord Derby. He spoke out for the Territorial Army with a wholehearted and chivalrous enthusiasm, arising from a great deal of personal interest and knowledge, which I am sure delighted all those who heard it. What is our case against the Territorial Army&#x2014;or rather, I withdraw the word "against," because it may give offence to my noble friend, and we have no case against the Territorial Army. We have views about the Territorial Army, and that is the way I prefer to put it. Our case about the Territorial Army rests upon two bases. The first is the statements and admissions of the Secretary of State for War himself. He has told us over and over again that the Territorial Force never can he efficient in peace. He said this year, in the debate on the Army Estimates in the House of Commons, that at least two years would be required to place the Territorial Army man for man on an equality with an enemy whom they might have to encounter. He also said on the same occasion&#x2014;
<quote>"In its nature the Territorial Army is a half-baked Force."</quote>
I should not have dared to apply such an epithet for fear of giving offence to some of my friends on this side of the House, although my private opinion would be that the cake has scarcely got into the oven at all. However, it is upon these statements that our case rests first of all. The second part of our case rests upon the facts and figures contained in the Reports. I was astonished to hear Lord Derby say this evening that he looked with suspicion upon all official reports. I always understood that the annual report of the Post Office, which is one of the most engaging documents that comes under our attention and for which the noble Lord himself was once responsible, was au absolutely impeccable document. I myself have been responsible for issuing, and, indeed, writing, so many official reports in my day that I cannot be expected to endorse the rather cynical view with regard to them expressed by my noble friend.<lb/>
But whatever may be the general merits of the case about official reports, you cannot get away from the facts and figures
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0528"/>
<col>1005</col>
contained in this official report about the Territorial Army, all the more that they appear in a document issued by the father of the scheme, who, if he had a desire in the matter, would, of course, be anxious to represent things in the most favourable light. When you find from these official figures that in the Territorial Army there is a shortage of 1,450 officers and 44,000 men; that last year the total strength fell by 3,000 men; that the number of recruits&#x2014;and this is a more than significant symptom&#x2014;fell from 110,000 to 42,000, how can you say this Force is in a prosperous or flourishing condition? When, further, you read that it contains 13,000 boys under the age of eighteen and 83,000 lads under the age of twenty&#x2014;nearly half of the total force&#x2014;how can you say it is a mature or powerful Force? When you find that as many as 75,000 spent less than a fortnight in camp last year, and 26,000 never went into camp at all, how can you say that it is efficient for war? And when the Secretary of State for War repeats, as he constantly does, that this Force cannot be trained, and he does not expect it to be trained, until after the outbreak of hostilities, and that even then six months will be required for the purpose, how can you regard it as a serious unit in the defences of this country?<lb/>
We all know that every conceivable effort has been made to give vitality and substance to this movement. The Secretary of State for War must be tired of the congratulations which are heaped upon him in that respect. We are aware of the speeches that he has made, the prize meetings which he has attended, the books that he has fathered, the success with which he has induced even Generals and Admirals&#x2014;ordinarily the most diffident of men&#x2014;to assume with him the joint privileges of authorship. We know he has told us that in the forthcoming year he is going to spend the best part of a million on drill halls and riding schools and all sorts of paraphernalia. Yet everybody knows the Force is contracting and that its limit has been reached. You cannot hope to add to the numbers, and, as a noble Lord reminded us in this debate, it is in the year 1913, in September of that year, when 100,000 men will be eligible to take their discharge, that the real moment of crisis will occur, and we shall know then and once for all whether the Territorial Force is going to survive, or whether it is going to dwindle and finally disappear.<lb/>
<col>1006</col>
The Secretary of State for War once told us that the Territorial Army is "the last word of the voluntary system." I agree with him. I have never hidden my opinions upon this matter. I believe that compulsory training in some form or other must come in this country. I believe that many of us sitting in this House to-night will live to see it. I will not examine the somewhat difficult problem put before us by Lord Newton, who seemed to think that, whatever might be the views of some of us who sit on this Bench on the subject, no Government will ever dare to take the matter up. It is a fundamental principle of his view of politics that both Front Benches are invariably tarred with the same brush. However that may be, I am one of those who hold that the voluntary system in this country has failed, and that you can neither do your duty to the Empire at large, nor fulfil the obligations to your Allies, nor defend the United Kingdom under the voluntary system. I believe, further, that the feeling in favour of some such change is growing in this country as rapidly as it has done in the Colonies, where it is part of their accepted politics, a policy adopted by none more readily than by the Labour and Socialist Parties. I believe it is growing in this country, not on its military merits, but because of the enormous advantages, moral, physical, and industrial, which this country is gradually realising will ensue from its adoption.<lb/>
I say it is not being adopted on military grounds. Why? Because I do not think that that feeling has a chance so long as the Secretary of State for War goes about making the sort of speeches he does throughout the country. So long as the noble Viscount goes about, invested with his high responsibility, and endowed with those powers of soporific and mellifluous speech which he possesses, I do not think we have a chance. I will give the House an illustration of the sort of speech to which I refer. He went down to Grimsby on November 28 last year and said&#x2014;
<quote>"In naval and military defence we are absolutely equipped to meet all emergencies and situations."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01850"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01851"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble Lord did not say "Hear hear" from any sympathy. His cheer is one of profound surprise, if not of unmitigated disgust. But the noble Viscount went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"And the person who says we are not"&#x2014;</quote>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0529"/>
<col>1007</col>
that is to say, not absolutely equipped to meet all emergencies&#x2014;
<quote>"is in a blue funk."</quote>
Well, if that be so, most of us are in a blue funk. I at once accept the position. I take up my position in the school of "blue funk" along with the noble and gallant Field-Marshal who sits upon the Cross Benches, and all I can say is that for my own part I would sooner be in a "blue funk" with the noble and gallant Field-Marshal than I would be in an asylum for the blind with the Secretary of State for War. However, I only make that confession about compulsory training for myself. I have no right to pledge, and I would not venture to pledge, a single member who is sitting on this side of the House, or a single member who sits on this Bench on the subject. Many of them hold entirely different views, although I think there is a movement in the direction of agreement rather than from it. However, as I say, many of them hold different views. But I would certainly like to remind noble Lords that in voting for the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal you are not voting one way or the other about compulsory service. That issue is not raised. [Ironical cheers from the Government</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01852">Benches.] I do not quite understand those ironical cheers. Noble Lords opposite seem to cheer as though they had suddenly discovered that we are suffering from some undesirable incubus. I am sure, for my own part, we should be only too glad to have a vote on the question. Whereas two years ago we were, in circumstances of particular pressure, only in a minority of twenty in this House, my impression is that if we were to vote upon the question now we should be in a considerable majority. However that may be, it is not the issue before your Lordships to-night. The issue raised is that stated in the terms of the Motion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, which it seems to me has been successfully established in his speech and in the speeches which have succeeded; it has been endorsed by all competent military authority both in this country and abroad, and if your Lordships proceed to a vote I believe it will receive the acceptance of the majority of your Lordships' House.</p>

<title>SIGHT TESTS IN THE MERCANTILE<lb/> MARINE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01869"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose to call attention to the tests in colour and form vision to which candidates for Board of Trade certificates as master or mate are at present subjected, and to the form vision test which it is proposed to introduce in the year 1914; to refer to the composition of the Departmental Committee which has been appointed by the Board of Trade to inquire into and advise upon these tests; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01870">The noble Lord said: My Lords, during the session of 1909 I brought this question of sight tests to your Lordships' notice. But in view of the immense importance of it, not only from the point of view of safety of life at sea, but that under the present system it may result in men losing their means of livelihood most undeservedly through its uncertain and faulty nature, I feel that I am justified in calling attention to it once more.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01871">As your Lordships are aware, all candidates at Board of Trade examinations for certificates qualifying them to command or officer British merchant vessels must first undergo a test as to their competency and efficiency in both colour and form vision. The Board of Trade before instituting these tests consulted experts, and the present tests were adopted by the Board of Trade on the recommendations of a Committee appointed by the Royal Society for this special purpose in the year 1892. A distinguished member of this House, Lord Rayleigh, was Chairman of this Committee. I trust that nothing I may say about the Committee will be accepted in anything but a purely general sense, and I certainly
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0532"/>
<col>1013</col>
would not presume to cast a scintilla of doubt upon the noble Lord's profound knowledge and on his undoubted impartiality and good faith. But I think that the noble Lord must admit that, of late years, these eyesight tests which are applied by the Board of Trade examiners have raised a storm of hostile criticism, and there are renowned ophthalmologists, not to mention all captains and officers, who, of course, are competent to treat the matter in a sound practical light, who are emphatically of opinion that these tests are miserably inefficient and provide a ready source of grievous injustice. They may result in the failure of men whose colour and form vision are perfectly normal, whilst, on the other hand, it is contended that they may admit of dangerously colour-blind men qualifying for a certificate. An eminent ophthalmologist told me that he brought several colour-blind people to Sir William Abney, who tested them with the present official tests and declared their colour vision was all right.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01872">Your Lordships may remember the now celebrated case of Mr. John Trattles, a remarkable illustration of muddle as regards these eyesight tests. This officer went to sea in 1897. In 1904 he passed the tests and also the rest of the examination, and was granted a second mate's certificate. He served for over twelve months as second officer of a large steamer, and then presented himself for a first mate's certificate. The examiner failed him in colour-vision. On appeal to the Board of Trade he was re-examined in London by Sir William Abney and Captain Harvey, who both confirmed the failure. The Board of Trade then requested Mr. Trattles to surrender his certificate as second mate. He declined to do so, and demanded an Inquiry. In September, 1905, the Board ordered a Local Marine Board Inquiry in London. After hearing both expert and practical evidence and testing Mr. Trattles themselves, the London Local Marine Board decided that he was perfectly competent in colour-vision. Mr. Trattles then went to sea, and in April, 1906, again presented himself for examination for a first mate's certificate. He was examined in colour and form vision by the Board of Trade examiner and passed. He then passed the rest of the examination consisting of navigation, seamanship, and other matters. After passing, the Board of Trade declined to grant him his certificate on the ground that on a previous occasion
<col>1014</col>
he had been failed in colour-vision. Naturally, by this time the case was arousing a considerable amount of public interest.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01873">Fortunately fox Mr. Trattles, he was a member of the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, who spared neither effort nor expense in protecting him. Whilst withholding his first mate's certificate, the Board of Trade continued to demand the surrender of his second mate's certificate. Mr. Trattles continued, on advice, to decline to comply. Not content with the result of a previous Inquiry which they had ordered, the Board of Trade then ordered a further one under Section 471 of the Merchant Shipping Act, appointing for this purpose Sir Francis Mowatt, assisted by Mr. John Dickinson, one of the metropolitan Police magistrates. To shorten the story, amongst other practical evidence strongly upholding Mr. Trattles, both the owner and the captain of the steamer in which he had served for some considerable time were emphatically of opinion that he was perfectly competent. The Board of Trade's chief reliance rested upon their expert adviser, Sir William Abney, and the Court witnessed the tests which were applied by Sir William Abney and also by Captain Harvey, who cooperated with him. The defence rightly insisted that as the Court, had witnessed these tests they should also give Mr. Trattles the opportunity of a test of a practical nature. The Court, agreed to this, and, a Trinity steamer being lent for the purpose, the examiner appointed by the Elder Brethren of Trinity House at the request of the Court, Commander Wilson Barker, R.N.R., commanding the "Worcester," put Mr. Trattles through a searching practical test on the River Thames and its outlying waters. This test was personally witnessed by Mr. John Dickinson, a member of the Court. After this test Commander Wilson Barker gave evidence to the effect that he was convinced that Mr. Trattles was perfectly competent. The decision of the Court was to the same effect, and Mr. Trattles's certificate as second mate, which had been surrendered to Sir Francis Mowatt at the commencement of the Inquiry, was returned to him. The Imperial Merchant Service Guild then caused an application to be addressed to the Board of Trade that they would grant him his certificate as first mate, the examination for which he had passed. This was acceded to by the Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01874">I mentioned this particular case in a previous debate when moving that a Select
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0533"/>
<col>1015</col>
Committee be appointed to consider the conditions under which eyesight tests for mercantile marine certificates are conducted. Were it the only instance where most serious trouble and complications have arisen, I would not have laid too much stress upon it. I quoted it to serve as an illustration. When I moved for a Select Committee my noble friend who represents the Board of Trade in this House informed us that the Board of Trade were of opinion that these tests as at present carried out are efficient and that they did not consider that I had made out any case for a Select Committee. But, as in the case of certificates for the coasting trade which I dealt with last week, they have had to alter their views, and have been forced to give way to public opinion. They have appointed a Select Committee, or rather it is called a Departmental Committee, which has been carrying on its duties for some little time. Needless to say, the announcement that a Committee would be appointed gave, great satisfaction. But this satisfaction gave place to dismay when the actual constitution of the Committee was announced.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01875">One would naturally imagine that any Committee appointed by the Board of Trade, especially one dealing with a subject of such grave importance, would be an absolutely impartial one and untrammelled by anything which might hitherto have transpired. I feel confident that your Lordships will agree with me in this. But I trust to prove that this has been far from the case. The present eyesight tests, which were adopted on the recommendations of a Special Committee appointed by the Royal Society, have been condemned root and branch by many people whose opinions must command the greatest respect and weight. Further than this, the Marine Department of the Board of Trade must also accept considerable responsibility, as it is they who are given the powers by Parliament and who have ordered certain inquiries with the object of forcing officers to surrender the certificates which represent their livelihoods. I suggest, therefore, that any Departmental Committee appointed should bear no taint of suspicion as to undue influence being used, and that those composing the Committee should not have had in the smallest degree any connection whatever with either the Royal Society or the Board of Trade in so far as concerns the tests which
<col>1016</col>
are now forming the subject of investigation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01876">But what is the case? Lord Rayleigh, the Chairman of the Committee of the Royal Society which recommended these tests, is a leading member of the new Committee. In the course of a previous debate I was informed that the Board of Trade had communicated with Lord Rayleigh prior to its taking place in this House. It seemed that the noble Lord had written to the effect that unfortunately he could not be present, but he informed the Board that he did not think that they could be wrong in following the advice of their expert adviser Sir William Abney. It was Sir William Abney who originally failed Mr. Trattles in colour-vision, and it was he who appeared as principal witness-for the Board of Trade when they sought to take away Mr. Trattles's certificate. But from the result of the case it was clear that the Court did not accept his evidence or his tests as proof of Mr. Trattles's incompetency. Sir William Abney has not been appointed to sit on the present Committee, but one of the Secretaries of the Committee is Dr. William Watson, a Fellow of the Royal Society, who I understand was, and possibly still is, chief technical assistant to Sir William at the Royal College of Science. It is only human that Fellows of the Royal Society sitting on the present Committee will be possessed of a natural disinclination to cast any reflections on the eyesight tests which were previously recommended by the Royal Society.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01877">On the present Committee appointed by the Board of Trade, apart from Dr. William Watson, of the Royal Society, no fewer than five out of eleven of the Committee are Fellows of the Royal Society. Let me go further. One of the experts who had witnessed the tests applied by Sir William Abney when he failed Mr. Trattles was Dr. J. H. Parsons. Dr. Parsons attended the special Inquiry into the case of Mr. Trattles and strongly supported Sir William Abney's justification of the present tests. I find that. Dr. Parsons has been appointed a member of the Committee now sitting. I would ask your Lordships in all seriousness to consider whether a Committee of this sort can command the confidence of anybody. Certainly not of those connected with shipping. There is a very strong suspicion of, I will not say
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0534"/>
<col>1017</col>
jobbery, but of engineering of a very improper character, and one has reason for strongly suspecting that an effort has been made to whitewash the present tests and the action of the Board of Trade in respect to them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01878">The appointment of the Departmental Committee is unquestionably the outcome of the great outcry raised by the Imperial Merchant Service Guild. Naturally those whose livelihoods are at stake&#x2014;the captains and officers of our mercantile marine&#x2014;have a right to demand every possible consideration in this matter. But the Guild were given no opportunity of nominating a representative on the Committee, and indeed were satisfied when assured by the Board of Trade that they wished the Committee to be a perfectly impartial one. I think I have proved that the Board's assurance was a very empty one. It is true that the Committee have invited the Guild to tender evidence, but the invitation has been refused, the Guild declining to commit themselves in any war to the doings or recommendations of the Committee, and there is not the slightest reason to doubt that they could have given some very valuable information which is now lost to the investigation which is in progress. I regret that it has been necessary for me to refer at some length to this matter, but I deem it my duty in the interests of safety of life at sea and also of those who command and officer British merchant ships and who are so badly off in the way of representation in Parliament, to bring to the notice of your Lordships the extraordinary methods which are sometimes pursued by the Board of Trade, and I suggest that before the recommendations of this Committee are acted on they should be submitted to a Committee of independent and practical men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01879">I will conclude my remarks by a brief reference to the new tests in form-vision&#x2014;that is, distinguishing certain objects at a certain distance&#x2014;which are to be introduced by the Board of Trade in the year 1914. The Board have even gone further than the original Committee of the Royal Society. Their hands were forced by the last Colonial Shipping Conference, as can be seen by a reference to the Blue Book. Why our Colonies should step in and dictate to the Government on such a matter seems incomprehensible to me, but it is decided that the new tests shall be introduced. The new proposals have excited the greatest
<col>1018</col>
indignation on the part of those representing captains and officers. This indignation is also shared by the shipowners of our country. Various of their great representative associations have with complete unanimity adopted resolutions condemning the proposed tests; there is absolutely no evidence whatever that any accidents have ever arisen at sea through inefficiency in form-vision. Under the new tests, which are of the utmost severity, it amounts to a certainty that a very great proportion of candidates for certificates of competency will be failed. It is also quite certain that a very large number of those now holding certificates would be quite unable to pass the test were they subjected to it. Your Lordships will appreciate the results of all this. There will be a vast amount of suffering of a most grievous kind inflicted upon a deserving class of the community who are entitled to all possible protection and sympathy at our hands. There will be a very serious inadequacy of certificated men. If only for our safety and welfare in time of war it is imperative that there should be a full complement of responsible and certificated officers in the mercantile marine. I would ask the Government to pause in this matter before they create a sorry state of affairs. The tests which are suggested are ridiculed, and I am at a loss to understand the theory that, because a man cannot read certain letters&#x2014;each eye being separately tested&#x2014;at a distance of sixteen feet, it must therefore be assumed that his seafaring vision is defective and that he cannot discern objects or pick up lights at sea with perfect efficiency. In all earnestness I ask that renewed consideration should be devoted to this matter now, when there is ample time for doing so. If our shipowners are fully satisfied with the present tests in form-vision, surely it is folly for any Government Department to interfere at the risk of doing incalculable injury to our greatest national industry. I move for a Return showing what accidents, if any, have occurred at sea in our mercantile marine through a deficiency in form-vision amongst officers in charge of ships. I also move that the Board of Trade should furnish their reasons for adopting the new test for form-vision, and state who has recommended it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01880"><i>Moved</i>, That there be laid before the House Papers relating to the tests in colour and form vision to which candidates for Board of Trade certificates as master or
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0535"/>
<col>1019</col>
mate are at present subjected, and to the form vision test which it is proposed to introduce in the year 1914.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Muskerry</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01881"><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I enter into the other details to which the noble Lord has referred I should like to say a word with regard to the gentleman around whose name this discussion has ranged. I refer to Mr. Trattles. The noble Lord has given the House a perfectly accurate account of what happened in the case of Mr. Trattles. My right hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade has dealt with the case, which, as you have heard, was decided first one way and then another. Mr. Trattles's vision, I think we may take it, is not quite normal, though it has been decided that it is safe. My right hon. friend referred it to a further Court, and the result of that inquiry was that Mr. Trattles was given back his certificate. I should like to take this opportunity of saying, on my own behalf, that I am very glad that this gentleman, who I believe is a very efficient officer, is now in a position to carry on his profession again.<lb/>
I am afraid I cannot, enter into a discussion to-day on the merits or demerits of the Board of Trade sight tests. I hope, in saying that, that the noble Lord will not think that I am in any way trying to detract from the importance of this question, or that I am in any way discourteous to him. The reason, as your Lordships will have gathered from listening to the noble Lord's speech, is that my right hon. friend has referred the whole question to a Departmental Committee, and I think that until that Committee reports any discussion of the sort would be not only unprofitable but perhaps undesirable as well. I think I had better read to your Lordships the terms of reference to that Committee. The Committee are invited&#x2014;
<quote>"to inquire into what degree of colour blindness or defective form vision in persons holding responsible positions at sea causes them to he incompetent to discharge their duties, and to advise whether any, and if so what, alterations are desirable in the Board of Trade sight tests at present in force for persons serving or intending to serve in the merchant service or in fishing vessels, or in the way in which those tests are applied."</quote>
Your Lordships will see that the terms of reference cover the whole field of inquiry in this matter, and I am sure that when that Committee has reported my right hon. friend will review the whole matter most
<col>1020</col>
carefully, not only the colour tests, but also those tests of form vision to which the noble Lord has referred, and as to which notice has been given that it is proposed that the new tests should come into force the year after next. The whole matter will be reconsidered when this Committee has reported.<lb/>
The noble Lord has criticised the composition of this Committee. I can only say that my right hon. friend has no ulterior motive in this matter. He really is not guilty of any deep laid scheme. He has appointed a Committee to advise him on a highly scientific and technical matter connected with his Department, and he has done so with the object of ascertaining what is the best course for him to follow. I think I must read to your Lordships the names of the gentlemen who compose the Committee. The Chairman is Mr. Dyke Acland, whose name is well known to the House. Then there are Mr. Raymond Beck, the Chairman of Lloyds; Captain Thomas Golding, an Elder Brother of Trinity House; Professor Gotch, Professor of Physiology at Oxford; Mr. Norman Hill, the Secretary of the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association and Chairman of the Board of Trade Advisory Committee on Shipping; Mr. Edward Nettleship, whose name is well known as a distinguished ophthalmic surgeon now retired from practice; Dr. Parsons, to whom the noble Lord has referred, another distinguished ophthalmic surgeon who is still in practice; Professor Poynting, Professor of Physics of Birmingham University; Lord Rayleigh, who is well known to your Lordships on account of his scientific attainments; and Sir Arthur R&#x00FC;cker, a distinguished physicist. The other member was Professor Starling, who has unfortunately been obliged to resign his position owing to ill-health, and whose place has been taken by Professor Sherrington, Professor of Physiology at Liverpool University.<lb/>
That is a very strong Committee, and my right hon. friend's object in appointing it was that he believed, and he still believes, that it is a thoroughly impartial Committee which will be able to give him the best possible advice on this matter. The noble Lord has referred to the fact that some half dozen of the gentlemen composing the Committee belong to the Royal Society, and he appeared to think that members of the Royal Society might be prejudiced in
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0536"/>
<col>1021</col>
this matter because the present sight tests are founded on the Report of the Committee of the Royal Society which sat twenty years ago. I do not think that is an argument which will weigh very much with the House, particularly when we consider that science is always advancing, and I do not think that the members of the Royal Society are in the least likely to be of opinion that there is any imputation on their body if what was acknowledged to be the last word in science twenty years ago is now found to be not quite up to date. Besides, it would be as absurd to say that in composing a scientific Committee you should have no members of the Royal Society upon it as it would have been to say, when the Constitutional Conference was being got together last year, that you would have no members of the Privy Council upon it. With regard to the other two gentlemen whose appointment the noble Lord criticised, it is quite true that Dr. Parsons did give evidence against Mr. Trattles in one of the many cases with regard to Mr. Trattles, but I can explain his presence on the Committee in a manner which I am sure will be perfectly satisfactory to the House. Dr. Parsons is at present there because his name was furnished to the Board of Trade by the Royal College of Surgeons when they were asked to suggest a suitable person as a member of it. The other gentleman&#x2014;Dr. Watson&#x2014;is not really a member of the Committee at all, but is acting as Secretary. It was thought that his scientific knowledge might be of advantage to the Committee, and that is the only reason why he was appointed. I do not believe your Lordships will think that in appointing this Committee, as my right hon. friend has done, to advise him with regard to this highly scientific and technical matter and to help him in carrying out a duty which is imposed upon him by Act of Parliament, he has been actuated by any but the most transparent motives of wishing to arrive at what was the best and what was the truth in regard to this question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01882"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say one word, in reference to the Committee that has been referred to, in support of what has fallen from my noble friend who has just sat down. In the first place, if you are to have the highest scientific knowledge you must take members of the Royal Society, because the Royal Society is composed of those who are most skilled in scientific matters in all depart
<col>1022</col>
ments of science, and to suppose that the members of the Royal Society who have been appointed would be in any improper manner influenced by a Report of a Committee twenty years ago, is my noble friend will forgive me for saying, really absurd. They certainly would be influenced, of course, so far as it was right that they should be influenced, by the Report of the Committee of twenty years ago; but where advances have been made in science they would not feel themselves in the least bound by that Report or the least indisposed to take a different view if evidence was advanced in favour of a different view being taken. I happen to know some of the gentlemen on the Committee who are interested in science, and with some of the, others I am connected in matters of business, and I must say it seems to me to be a strong and excellent Committee, and one which would take a reasonable view of any matter brought before it. I think, therefore, that my noble friend who has brought forward this Motion may very well be satisfied that the matter is in very good hands, and that the Committee will certainly take a reasonable view of the whole subject, on which they are thoroughly qualified to advise the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01883"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BANGOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I would ask, Ought not the vast body of officers concerned in this important matter to have a perfect confidence in the tests to which they arc to be subjected, and on which their whole future life depends? When one hears of a man being condemned because he cannot pass certain theoretical' tests on land, and then when taken out on the ocean in a ship and tested in the practical exercise of his vocation lie is found to be perfectly competent, one naturally asks whether it would not be possible to devise some practical test in the exercise of a. man's duties as a commander or an officer to prove whether he can properly fulfil his duties or not. Surely it would not be difficult to take a malt out on a ship on a dark night and see whether or not he can properly distinguish lights, and so on.</membercontribution></p>

If a man is put on the bridge of a steamer and is taken down a river that he does not know and is able to distinguish correctly the colour of every light on shore that he passes, the lights of every vessel that he meets, and the colour of the stars, all I can say is that if all the scientific men in Europe or in the world said that that man was colour blind it would not alter my opinion that he was perfectly competent, so far as colour vision goes, to take charge of any ship.

The scheme which is the subject of my Motion was settled by the Board of Education and proposes to alter the trust of a portion of a certain Yorkshire charity. The scheme is made under the powers granted by the Endowed Schools Act of 1869, and has to be laid on the Table of both Houses for two months in order to give either House an opportunity of objecting if it desires to do so. This particular scheme was laid on the Table of your Lordships' House on February 13 last, and I do not think the Government can object to my action in calling attention to the matter, because, after all, we are only exercising our statutory right. There
<col>1024</col>
have been many precedents for successful resistance to these schemes, and I hope that I shall be able to induce the House to add one more to the list. There have been a good many different authorities entrusted with the control and management of these matters, but I do not think it is necessary to go through the whole history from the days of the special jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery and of the Charity Commissioners, who made their first appearance in 1853, up to the year 1899, when their powers were transferred to the Board of Education, in whose hands they now remain. Nor is it necessary to deal at any length with the various Acts affecting charitable educational trusts.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01890">It is, perhaps, as well to remember that the original Endowed Schools Act was passed in 1869 as the result of the Report of a Commission which sat in 1867. The Report of that Commission recommended a good many changes extending the power of the old Court of Chancery on educational lines where the original form became unsuited to the changed circumstances of the day; and I think it is important&#x2014;from my point of view it is very important&#x2014;to bear in mind that the main principle, as I think I may call it in view of the various extensions, was that where changes were made they were still to carry into effect the wishes of the original founder. That will be found, I believe, in the Preamble of the Act of 1869. So that, no matter what body has been in authority, the principle that has guided these alterations is the principle that the powers of the Board are judicial and not political.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01891">Now, my Lords, with regard to the present scheme, the only clause in it that we need deal with is Clause 2. It is a very important clause, and it proposes to repeal Clause 47 of the scheme of May 3, 1888, which clause ensures the carrying out of the wishes of the founder of the charity that the religious education given in these particular schools shall be Church of England education. I would ask your Lordships to bear that in mind. I will now leave the general question and come to the question of the particular charity which is proposed to be dealt with by this scheme. The name of it is the Wheelwright Grammar Schools at Dewsbury. On October 14, 1724, John Wheelwright by will left property to trustees to found and maintain two schools, one at Dewsbury and another at Rishworth, for the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0538"/>
<col>1025</col>
children of the poor. One of the principal clauses of that will contained these words&#x2014;
<quote>"I also will and desire that the said children be religiously and virtuously brought up and educated according to the doctrines of the Church of England."</quote>
That, my Lords, represents what were the wishes of the original founder. There is no uncertainty about it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01892">I come now to the first scheme of alteration, the scheme to which I have briefly referred, of May 3, 1888. There is some rather interesting correspondence in connection with that scheme. The scheme, roughly, was to appoint a separate body of trustees for a new part of the school in question, the school affected by this particular scheme, and it was proposed to be done by the Charity Commissioners under the Endowed Schools Act to which I have referred. The correspondence which took place between the trustees of the school and the then responsible authority, the Charity Commissioners, shows exactly what were the views of the trustees and the governors and those who were responsible for the conduct of the school. They did not approve of the scheme as suggested by the Charity Commissioners, and they stated that if the Commissioners desired the reasons why, they would give them. The Trustees went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"We think it sufficient to say that the charity was formed and endowed as a Church of England charity, and such it must remain. There is no confusion or ambiguity in the direction contained in Mr. Wheelwright's will. He directed that the children be religiously and virtuously brought up and educated according to the doctrines of the Church of England as by law established. The trustees are determined, therefore, that they have no alternative but to oppose every scheme which the Charity Commissioners may propose unless the scheme is one which, in their opinion, is within the lines of Mr. Wheelwright's will."</quote>
That was the position of the trustees, and that was accepted by the Charity Commissioners, who replied&#x2014;
<quote>"With a view to secure that the Church of England character of the Foundation shall not be impaired by an accidental majority among the governors the Commissioners have accepted the proposal made by the committee, and approved by the trustees, for a retirement by rotation of the co-optative governors first appointed. Having this provided that the first, governors shall, to the number of nine out of fourteen be members of the Church of England, and taken security against the possibility of an accidental majority the other way, and having directed in Clause 47 that religious instruction in accordance with the doctrines of the Church of England shall be given in the school the Commissioners have in
<col>1026</col>
this respect made such provision as to them appears proper and sufficient for the maintenance of the Church of England character of the Foundation."</quote>
That was the answer of the Commissioners, and that is the explanation for the introduction of Clause 47 which it is now sought to repeal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01893">The next step took place in 1899, when the authority for dealing with these things was transferred to the Board of Education; and in 1900 a new and a much wider scheme was introduced by the then authorities, which proposed an amalgamation with certain governing bodies of three other educational charities, the trust, remaining practically the same. There were grave objections to this course on the part of those representing the Wheelwright Charity on account of the alteration of the balance of the governing body, which removed the security for the maintenance of the Church of England character of the school as promised by the scheme of 1888; but an undertaking, a definite and most formal and binding undertaking, was given by all those concerned, with the approval of the authorities, especially emphasising the fact that Clause 47 was not to be interfered with. Therefore, under these various schemes the main point was driven home by those concerned&#x2014;namely, that the character of the teaching in the school should be that of the Church of England and none other; and we then said&#x2014;
<quote>"Religious instruction therefore continued to be given in the school, and, it may be added, the County Council of the West Riding of Yorkshire continued to make grants to the school under the Technical Instruction Act"</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01894">That is a point to which I shall refer later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01895">By Section 4 of the Education Act, 1902, it is enacted that a county council, when making grants out of a county fund to a secondary school, shall not require as a condition of such grants that any particular form of religious instruction shall or shall not be given in the school. Therefore that entirely debars from a county council the right to decide as to what form of religious education should be given. During all this time the West Riding County Council were giving&#x00A3;335 a year to this particular school. Now I come to the trouble with the West Riding County Council, which is really the cause, I take it, of the introduction of this extraordinary scheme. In. 1907, in spite of this section
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0539"/>
<col>1027</col>
to which I have referred, the West Riding County Council required the governors of the Wheelwright Grammar School to discontinue the Church of England religious teaching if the grants were to be continued, and for that purpose to apply for a scheme for deleting Clause 47. I will once more, if you will allow me, refer to the correspondence that took place between the Board of Education of that time and the various bodies concerned. There is a letter from the Board of Education to the Rishworth Trustees dated August 10, 1908, pressing on the trustees of this school the desirability of the governors allowing this scheme to go forward, because if they did not they would lose the grant and suffer accordingly. The words they use are these&#x2014;
<quote>"The authority [the local education authority] have up to the present year continued to aid the schools to the same extent us before the passing of the Education Act, 1902, (i.e., by a grant of&#x00A3;335 per annum conditional upon the provision of a certain number of free places to county council scholars), but they have recently intimated that unless the governors take steps to have the provision referred to removed from the Scheme&#x2014;</quote>
that is, the desire of the founder to carry on Church of England education in the schools&#x2014;
<quote>"they will withdraw all pecuniary support from the schools, and cease to recognise them for the instruction of pupil teachers and county minor scholars."</quote>
Then the letter goes on to urge upon the governing body the desirability of agreeing to this proposal on those lines, and it concludes by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"As the matter is, in its financial aspect, of vital importance to the Dewsbury Schools, which could hardly continue to exist if all county council support were withdrawn from them, the Board would be glad to have an opportunity of conferring with the Wheelwright Trustees in the matter at an early date."</quote>
That appointment took place. I would point out that what is obvious is that the Board of Education were anxious to avoid enforcing the law which required that the county council should not impose these conditions regarding religious education, and further this desire on their part to get the Rishworth Governors to do what is an illegal action was merely to save themselves, as it seems to me, and to avoid any trouble they might have had in dealing with this local education authority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01896">Then, my Lords, we get a step further. There is a further letter written from the
<col>1028</col>
Board of Education on November 13, 1908, with regard to the interview which had taken place. It proceeds to state&#x2014;
<quote>"In view of the position which has been taken up by the above-named trustees, it appears to the Board that it now rests with the governors to decide what is their duty in the circumstances, having regard on the one hand to the arrangement which was made at the time when the scheme of 1900 was established by the Charity Commissioners, and on the other to the discharge of their duties to the grammar schools. It is for the governors now to consider how far this arrangement is to be regarded as permanently binding upon them, or how far it may be necessarily liable to revision in view of the completely altered educational system which now exists. After due regard has been paid to these considerations the governors should decide whether or not a case has arisen which would justify them in declining to be bound further by that arrangement, notwithstanding the attitude which has been adopted by the Wheelwright Trustees in the matter. The Board, though willing to render such assistance as is possible to the governors, cannot, if they would, take over from them the responsibility of deciding as to the course which should be pursued in the circumstances, seeing that without the consent of the governing body the repeal of the denominational provision in Clause 47 of the scheme of May 3, 1888, cannot be effected. All that the Board can do is, in view of the risk to which the schools of the Foundation appear to lie exposed of being practically destroyed in consequence of the withdrawal by the local education authority of financial assistance, to submit the foregoing consideration for the careful attention of the governors."</quote>
But, my Lords, the responsibility does not rest with the governors; it rests with the Board of Education; it is they who are responsible and it is they who ought to decide what is to be done. It is, therefore, most unfair to put this pressure on a body like the governors of a school of this kind in order to endeavour to force them to get the authority out of a considerable difficulty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01897">As it happened, the governors, after considerable protest, accepted by a small majority the conditions which had been forced upon them. I do not think we can blame the governors, because their position was made almost impossible by the Board of Education. The governors show in their protest that they were bound by the undertaking they had given in 1900, and they were bound by every code of honour to do what they could to carry out the wishes of the founder of this charity. The subject was raised in the House of Commons recently, and the answer that was given then was that it was a pity to raise the question at all as the matter was being settled locally. I cannot imagine how anybody in authority could have made
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0540"/>
<col>1029</col>
such a defence as that. Settled locally&#x0021;Why, my Lords, every one was perfectly satisfied till the West Riding County Council interfered, and the agreement of the governors was only obtained after the pressure to which I have briefly referred was put upon them. The pressure was of the most drastic kind. It was financial, and it was put in a way that made it very difficult for the governors to resist; and I do think that it is hardly right for, the representative of a great Department like the Board of Education to claim a local settlement which is only secured by the pressure of the Board on the governors to break their trust in order to give effect to an illegal action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01898">There are a good many other points in connection with this matter to which I could refer, but I hope I have said enough. In the last session of Parliament Lord Crewe, in the speech that he delivered on the consideration of the Parliament Bill, gave a very interesting definition of what he considered to be the functions of Parliament. The first function that he gave to Parliament was "to keep in check the Executive." Now, when we find that the Executive, or part of it is endeavouring to obtain by administration what the Legislature has refused expressly, I say that we, as still a portion of the Parliament of the country, ought to exercise our function of keeping a check on the Executive. My Lords, that is on general lines. On the particular lines connected with this scheme, I would ask your Lordships to support my Motion on the ground that it is the duty of the Board of Education to enforce the law and not to facilitate violations of it; that the scheme is contrary to the principle of the Endowed Schools Act; that the object of the scheme is political and not educational; that it is a breach of the promise given by the Charity Commissioners, of whom the Board of Education is the successor; and, above all, and perhaps most important of all, on the ground that it is a violation of John Wheelwright's will, and would alienate a Church of England charity to undenominational purposes. I beg to move the Motion that stands in my name.</p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01900"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure His Majesty's Government have nothing to complain of, either in the fact that the noble Earl opposite has brought this question before your Lordships' House or with regard to the manner in which he has done so. I think we are all at one as to the main facts of the case, although naturally the Board of Education would draw a very different conclusion from the facts from that which the noble Earl has put before the House. I gathered from the remarks which the noble Earl addressed to your Lordships that he did not wish to proceed upon what I might term the strict legal interpretation of the matter. The noble Earl knows that there is a remedy on the strict legal side. There is tile possibility of at appeal to the Judicial Committee. That procedure has not been adopted. The alternative to it is to take the step, which the noble Earl has taken this afternoon, of asking your Lordships to approve of an Address to the Crown. Therefore I hope we may say that in this matter we are not dealing so much with the strictly legal aspect of it, but rather with the expediency of this scheme and the question whether or not the scheme as suggested and adopted by the Education Board is a good scheme.<lb/>
In the first place, I do not think that any noble Lord will deny, however much he might regret the fact, that the whole tendency of the administration of the Education Acts, not by one Party but by all Parties, ever since the Endowed Schools Act was passed in 1869, has been to throw down the barriers generally, social and local as well as religious barriers, and to open the benefits of school foundations&#x2014;certainly of those which came into existence before 1819&#x2014;to all comers. Those Acts provide proper machinery by which a Church of England school may be maintained intact unless the trustees consent otherwise; but where the trustees have no objection, and indeed wish to abolish the distinction, it is made easy for them under the Act to remove the tests which otherwise would exist. Therefore I think that in this case we must assume, if the noble Earl wishes to prove his point, that there are special circumstances why the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0541"/>
<col>1031</col>
distinctive character of the school should be maintained. In this matter, of course, the Board of Education must depend very largely upon the opinion of the man on the spot. We are often advised to do that in other matters, and the Board of Education is anxious to do it in a case of this kind. I do not wish to press too far the majority by which the assent to the scheme was agreed to by the local managers, but there is also the fact that the county council, representing a far larger area, is moving in the same direction.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01906"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to differ from the noble Marquess. I thought the legal remedy was by an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and that an appeal to that body had already been entered upon but not proceeded with by the noble Earl, as he preferred the present alternative. I confess that it was with some surprise I heard the noble Earl say that the responsibility for dealing with this matter rests with the Board of Education. Although he made the suggestion, he did not oblige us by going further into the matter and telling us in what way we were to insist upon our responsibility, or in what way the Board of Education were to act. Surely in this matter the whole policy of the Act of 1902 was to give the local authority power,
<col>1032</col>
and they are rather the people who are expected to act. It is they who have the money to administer, and it is they, rather than the Board of Education,' I think, to whom the noble Earl should appeal.<lb/>
But there is another aspect of the case to which I do not think very much attention has vet been paid, and that is how far the scheme as suggested by the Board of Education will be of benefit to the school itself. The school has been doing well in the past, though its financial position is not altogether reassuring as to the future. Your Lordships upon the information so far before you are not well able to decide how far this money, which is at the disposal of the West Riding County Council, is necessary for the future development and improvement of the school, and I venture to think that that is an aspect of the question to which the Board of Education is especially bound to pay attention. The governors wrote, towards the end of the year 1905, saying that there had been a considerable deficiency each year on the accounts of the schools, and that it would be necessary to reduce the staff to meet the deficiency. A reduction in the staff was made, but that was rather due to a reduction in the number of scholars. Then the governors are contemplating additions to the existing schools which will cost nearly&#x00A3;1,000. That, they say, will be met without difficulty from the school funds. The accounts for the year 1908&#x2013;9 show a total receipt of&#x00A3;3,545, of which the Board's grant was&#x00A3;1,067, but there was an expenditure of&#x00A3;3,795, making a deficit, apart from the aid given by the West Riding County Council, of no less than&#x00A3;250. There are further receipts which should be added from Hinchcliffe and Durham.<lb/>
It is probable, with the additions to the school and a new girls' school, which I understand the governors are very anxious to provide, that not only will the present county aid be necessary, but also the additional county aid, in order to maintain a financial equilibrium. So that at the present moment, so far as the schools themselves are concerned, the position is this, that with the present help they get from the West Riding County Council they are able to get along. If it were withdrawn, their position, though not desperate, would be naturally a great deal worse, and they would be largely crippled in their work.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0542"/>
<col>1033</col>
They need a larger grant in order that they may develop themselves thoroughly in the future, and in those circumstances the question is whether, after all is said and done, it would not be a wise thing for the governors to accept the grant on the terms which have been offered to them by the West Riding County Council. On that matter the Board of Education have accepted the resolution which the governors came to when they put forward this scheme. The Board of Education realise, however, that there is a great deal of objection to this scheme in your Lordships' House; and as the number of noble Lords who are present this afternoon shows how little likely we should be to successfully attempt determined resistance to the Motion of the noble Earl, we therefore shall not proceed to a Division if the general sense of the House shows itself to be determinedly hostile to the scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01907"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WAKEFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no desire to detain the House more than a moment. But as this school is situated in the diocese of Wakefield and I happen to know a good deal about the local history of the case, I may, perhaps, be allowed to say one word in answer to what has fallen from the noble Earl. The noble Earl wishes us to brush aside altogether the legal argument&#x2014;and indeed I am not qualified to express an opinion about the legal argument except as an ordinary plain man&#x2014;but I cannot think that the noble Earl would for a moment maintain that the resolution of the county council which sets aside Section 4 of the Act of 1902 can be anything but most flagrantly illegal. This is the feature of the case which, apart from all educational considerations, is really of public interest. It does seem to many of us who have studied this case very closely that it is nothing short of a scandalous thing that a powerful county council should be allowed to set aside an Act of Parliament and to say that the conditions on which it will give grants to secondary schools are conditions diametrically opposite to those expressly laid down in the Act.<lb/>
I am also very much surprised to hear from the noble Earl that he does not think that the Board of Education are responsible in a matter of this kind. It is a very difficult point, but I hope I may be able to make it clear in a few sentences. The Board of Education, in making a scheme, make it under the Endowed Schools Acts. But the scheme which they have now put
<col>1034</col>
out under the Endowed Schools Acts seeks to set aside the express undertaking honourably entered into by all parties concerned up to the time when the Charity Commissioners ceased to have jurisdiction over these schemes. The record of the Charity Commission is perfectly clean from first to last. They recognised expressly at each stage of all their schemes the Church of England character of this school. I do not wish to press this as a denominational matter. I want to press it as a matter of the maintenance of trusts, a matter of far larger importance and consequences than the mere maintenance of a denominational school. Under the Acts the Board of Education are responsible as the guardians of those trusts, and although it is perfectly true that the principles on which they have to administer the trusts in applying them to altered modern conditions are not quite so severe as those which apply to trusts under strictly <i>cy pres</i> conditions, yet it is expressly enacted, as Lord Dartmouth has pointed out, in the Preamble of the Act of 1869 that it is the will of the founder which has, as far as possible, to be carried out. Therefore, my Lords, when the noble Earl says that the Board of Education are not responsible it seems to me similar to a case where a headmaster of some great public school, on being appealed to by a helpless small boy in a lower form on account of an outrageous course of bullying on the part of the sixth form, should call him up and advise him to submit, and, on the boy still further protesting, say, "If you do not submit, I shall take the part of the sixth form." That seems to me to be the attitude of the Board of Education, and I think the analogy is pretty close. Fortunately the two Houses of Parliament are in the position of being, so to speak, the governors of that great public school, and there is a further appeal to us, and I trust your Lordships will insist that this scheme shall be referred back.<lb/>
Many other points have been mentioned by the noble Earl, but there is only one to which I will allude. He reminded your Lordships that the general trend of education has been towards the throwing down of barriers between class and class and between denomination and denomination, and he said, "Is it not a good thing that in a school like this these barriers should be thrown down?" My Lords, there are no barriers in this school to be thrown down. There is a conscience clause in operation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0543"/>
<col>1035</col>
There is the fact that no difficulty has ever arisen on the part of any parent and that very few scholars have ever been withdrawn. As a matter of fact, the Church of England teaching has never even been offered in the last few years, since the last scheme, to any except to the children of those parents who have desired in writing that their children should receive it. Therefore I am extremely sorry that the noble Earl should have put that forward. Then, again, he said, that where the trustees wish to remove tests facilities are now given to remove those tests. There are no tests whatever in this school. There are no tests for teachers, there are no tests for the religious education of the children, and there are no tests for the governors of the school. Therefore when the noble Earl tells us that this is a good scheme because it offers opportunities for throwing down barriers and for removing tests, I can only say that years ago the governors and the trustees of the charity were enlightened enough to do both things. I am sure your Lordships will believe me when I say that I have never taken an extreme or obstructive line on the matter of education, but I do believe that this scheme is inherently unjust. I believe it is a scandalous case of a great Government Department not carrying out its duty, and therefore I am very glad to support my noble friend in the Motion that he has put on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01908"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to intervene more than a very short time between your Lordships and the conclusion of this matter; but certain propositions have fallen from the right rev. Prelate which appear to me to go not only beyond the policy which Parliament has long laid down as governing these matters, but beyond the real circumstances of this case. As to the policy, is it seriously contended that the provisions in the will of the testator, a will which became operative in 1724, are to remain for all time? That is certainly not so in the case of private property where the will of the testator can only prevail for a short time. The dead hand has been given a more enduring trust in the case of charitable property, with the result that Parliament has interfered. I agree entirely with the doctrine that not only the letter but the spirit of the Act of Parliament ought to be observed, but Parliament has laid down, not merely the Preamble which the right rev. Prelate made reference to, but an express provision for
<col>1036</col>
relaxing from time to time, as the public-interest requires, the rules which had been adopted as to the way in which a charity is to be carried on. Under Section 19 of the Endowed Schools Act, 1869, it is expressly provided that, in the case of certain educational charities, you are not to make an alteration which you are otherwise entitled to make according to the general scheme of the Act unless you have the consent of the governing body. In this case you have the consent of the governing body.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01911"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The first point I am making at this stage is that you have got the consent of the governing body, and so far as any question of law is concerned with regard to that, the proper tribunal to decide it is a Court of Law and not Parliament. But I do not think it can be seriously contended that you require any other consent in this case. The Board of Education has been severely dealt with in this matter. What is the position of the Board of Education? The County Council of the West Riding, rightly or wrongly, as its policy, desires that the higher education which it assists should be free from denominational quality. They may be wrong or they may be right about that, but to say that they are acting illegally in taking that question of policy into account is more than the Act of Parliament entitles you so say. It is perfectly true that, under Section 4 of the Education Act of 1902, if the West Riding County Council were to withhold its assistance in a case where it was actually making a grant on the ground that it wished to differentiate between various forms of religious teaching, that would be illegal, and if it were acting illegally you could restrain it possibly by injunction. But under the Act the county council has a wide discretion as to how, and under what circumstances, and in the case of what bodies, it will assist higher education. Discretion has been given by Parliament in the Act of 1902 to the county councils to survey the field and say what higher education they will assist, and the condition is this, that if they do assist they are not to differentially treat different bodies on account of their religious tenets.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01913"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: There is no power to compel them to make a grant in any particular case if they chose to withhold it. That is the policy laid down in the Act, and, if that is so, then it is idle to talk of their having committed an illegal action in this case. You could not man-damns them. If they choose to withhold the money they may do so. Parliament has left it to them to say Yes or No, whether they will or will not make a grant, and you are helpless. That being so, what is the position? In the year 1900 a governing body was constituted for this school. That governing body desired to develop the school and so became dependent on the county council, and they cannot become dependent on the county council, unless they act in accordance with the wishes of the county council by getting rid of the denominational character of the teaching in the school.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01914"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Viscount seriously say that the governing body of this school desired this?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01915"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: If they did not desire to do it, I have no reason to think that they would have done it. The governing body, rather than let the school be starved, chose to take the course of promoting a scheme which got rid of the disability under which they lay, and accordingly the governing body, with its full and free consent, assented to the new scheme, and that; new scheme, which is before your Lordships' House and which was assented to by the governing body, has this clause in it which gets rid of the difficulty. Your Lordships are, of course, at liberty to take what view you like of the matter; but the governing body of this school is also at liberty to say what scheme it will consent to. It is given that power by the Act of Parliament, and that power it has exercised. The position, therefore, in which we are to-day is not to find a remedy for a wrong done; it is a question of preventing this school from developing itself, and from taking the only course which, in the opinion of those responsible for it, will make it efficient, and the only course which the Board of Education think a possible one if the school desires to progress. Your Lordships may dissent from the broad views of the County
<col>1038</col>
Council of the West Riding of Yorkshire, but, after all, then views are views which the electors have elected them to entertain. That there is any remedy for the situation, or that the rejection of the scheme will make things any better, seems to me to be out of the question. On the contrary, all that will happen will be that this school will he stunted in its development, and nobody will be any better for what has taken place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01916"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened, I need hardly say, with the greatest interest to all the speeches that have been made in the course of this debate. I do not think any one will deny that my noble friend who raised this question dealt very fully and clearly with all the details of this case, and as I listened to his speech I could not help thinking of the various occasions in your Lordships' House when we have had brought before us cases of harshness and injustice on the part of the County Council of the West Riding of Yorkshire in regard to denominational schools, but I think that a more harsh and a more unjust case has seldom been brought forward in your Lordships' House than the one we have been discussing this evening. The question, in my Mind, particularly after the speech of the noble Viscount who has just sat down, embraces possibly an even larger field than that, because, as far as I can gather, he seems to consider that the only course at the present moment for this school to pursue, if it is to enjoy prosperity, is to accede to the proposals of the county council through the Board of Education. That may be the point of view of the noble Viscount, but it certainly is not mine. This debate has shown beyond all doubt what I think is even a more serious question than that of the maintenance of the school&#x2014;namely, the political bias of a great Department in favour of its political supporters. I shall say a few words on that before I conclude, because I think that if the precedent started by the Board of Education is pursued in other Departments, the confidence which the country has at the present moment in these Departments cannot fail to be entirely lost.<lb/>
My noble friend dealt so fully with the whole question that I do not propose to go into it. But there was one expression which fell from the noble Viscount on which I should like to say a few words.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0545"/>
<col>1039</col>
He said, and very rightly, perhaps, that great changes had taken place during the past fifty or sixty years in the laws connected with the maintenance of trust property, and that it is many years now since Mr. Wheelwright demised this charity for the maintenance of what are called the Wheelwright Schools. Undoubtedly that is so. But changes have taken place in connection with the school at various intervals, and on each of those changes the stipulation was made that the school was to be a denominational school and that Church of England instruction was to be given in the school. Therefore it has been brought up to a much later date than might have been anticipated from what fell from the noble Viscount. Again, I think no one will deny that up to the year 1902, previous to the Education Act for which I specially, and the Government of which I had the honour of being a Member, was responsible, everything worked absolutely smoothly in this Dewsbury School. There were no objections made by parents to the teaching, as the right rev. Prelate stated. The children attended the school in perfect harmony and in accordance with their parents' wishes. The governors were carrying out the Government policy so far as religious instruction in secondary schools was concerned in accordance with what was called the McKenna <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i>. It was only after the passing of the Act of 1902 that this hostility, which was displayed to so many denominational schools by the West Riding County Council, for the first time developed itself. The county council took upon themselves a most arbitrary action. They told the governors of this school that if they continued to carry out the term of the trust, which was to give Church of England instruction, they would give them no grant, but if they dropped their Church of England instruction they might then have a grant. Surely that was the most extraordinary proposal that could possibly have been made. Then, in addition, the county council, as we are told, invited the governors to apply to the Board of Education for a new scheme, expunging from the old scheme of 1888 what the school had been formed for&#x2014;the provision of denominational education.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, arises the question, What ought the Board of Education to have done? I am not, going to cross swords on legal matters with the noble
<col>1040</col>
Viscount opposite, but reading the section of the Act as I do, I can only think that the Board of Education were encouraging the West Riding County Council to commit a breach of the law in agreeing to their version of the reading of that section. May I state what in my opinion was the duty of the Board of Education when they were approached by these governors, who, through the county council, were asking them to frame a scheme? To my mind the Board of Education ought to have protected the governors. They ought undoubtedly to have pointed out to them that the County Council of the West Riding was performing an illegality, and they ought to have drawn the attention of the county council to the law of the land as it existed, and if the county council had not carried out the law as it existed, then it was the duty of the Board of Education to take care that they did. They had the power to do so under mandamus. The noble Viscount opposite shakes his head, but I think he will find that on previous occasions when a mandamus has been taken out the county councils have had to do what the Board of Education told them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01917"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: That has been in quite a different case from the present case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01918"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I have not the particulars before me, but I think I am right in what I say.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01919"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Not in a case like this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01920"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I repeat that I think the Board of Education were encouraging the West Riding County Council in an illegality according to the Act of 1902. Then comes the point that the governors agreed to accept the scheme of the Board of Education. When certain changes took place the majority of the governors of the school were not denominational educationists, if I may use the expression, but they stipulated that Church of England teaching should be taught in that school. Then, as the right rev. Prelate said, considerable pressure, financial and otherwise, was brought to bear on the governors in order to induce them to accede to the present scheme, and the governors have acceded to it after great protest and under pressure. But now we come to the fact that the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0546"/>
<col>1041</col>
trustees, who, after all, are those responsible for the administration of this charity, object, and wisely object, to that scheme. That more or less is the case which is before your Lordships at the present moment.<lb/>
I would like to say a word as one who has had the honour of occupying the position of President of the Board of Education. I do regret to see the Board of Education at the present moment condoning illegal actions for what I can only call Party purposes, and I regret also to see the Board, who, as the successors to the Charity Commissioners, ought to act absolutely impartially, showing a partisan spirit instead of a judicial one. This to my mind is a very extraordinary case. It undoubtedly shows that political bias which the West Riding County Council have shown to many denominational schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire. They have shown their desire to squeeze out denominational education in the West Riding, and if the present state of things is allowed to exist, then I say that the West Riding County Council will be more or less confiscating for undenominational education a charity which was meant for denominational education. I will only say, in conclusion, that I hope the day is far distant when we shall see other Departments of the State taking the partisan and political views which the Board of Education has adopted, for, as I said before, if that state of things is allowed to exist the country will lose the confidence which it at present has in all our great Departments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01921"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War is imperfectly informed with regard to the facts of this case, and I can hardly think that he will maintain the position he appears to have taken up in view of the further facts which I may be able to put before him. Is the noble Viscount aware that the governors of the Wheelwright School only three or four years ago, during the time of these difficulties, very much objected to what was proposed to them by the local education authority&#x2014;that is, the West Riding County Education Authority?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01922"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: In 1908.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01923"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: Yes, in 1908 they entirely objected to what was proposed
<col>1042</col>
to them, and they objected so strongly that they prepared a fell and complete statement of their case and forwarded it with an appeal to the Board of Education requesting the Board to bring pressure on the county council and compel the county council to obey the law. That was their action. Not only did they do that, but the governors sent a thoroughly representative deputation to London, and their case was put before the Board, the deputation stating that the governors felt that they were bound to keep a religious clause in their scheme, and not to comply with the requirements of the local education authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01924"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It was the Wheelwright trustees, not the governing body of the school, who took action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01925"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It was the governors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01926"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Viscount's pardon. That was the action of the governors of the school in reference to what had been represented to them by the trustees of Rishworth School, the original Wheelwright trustees. I am speaking of the action of the governors of the school, and not of the Wheelwright trustees. If the noble Viscount will refer, he will see that it is the action of the governors of the school begging the Board of Education to compel the local education authority to obey the law. The only result of that deputation as far as is known is that the education authority wrote to the Wheelwright trustees stating, whit must be admitted was a very extraordinary presentment of the case, that the governors of the Dewsbury School were prepares: to comply with the requirements of the county council, and endeavouring to induce the Wheelwright trustees to relieve the governors of the Dewsbury School from the obligations they had entered into in their arrangements in 1890 and 1891. The governors of the Dewsbury School very unwillingly assented to what the Education Department proposed because they were in a very difficult position, pressure being put upon them by the Education Department, and they did not think they were going to get ordinary justice. When the governors of the Dewsbury School were told that they had been prepared to comply with the requirements of the county council, which they only learnt some months after, they at once
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0547"/>
<col>1043</col>
vehemently repudiated the statement, and as I say, it was only after finding that they could get no ordinary justice from the Board of Education, and threatened with the withdrawal of the grants by the county council, that the governors, after a strong protest and by a very narrow majority, submitted. It is perfectly untrue to say that the governors of the Dewsbury School did not do as much as they possibly could to withstand the action of the Education Department in regard to this matter.<lb/>
May I also point out this to the noble Viscount. He says that trusts from time to time have to be altered. The trusts of the Wheelwright Schools have been altered. Under the Wheelwright will the schools were elementary schools, and the trusts have been so far enlarged that instead of an elementary school the Dewsbury School has been converted into a secondary school. It had met every possible requirement; no kind of fault was found with the school; no complaint was made about its religious teaching. The only reason why the local education authority threatened to withdraw the grant was on account of the denominational teaching given in the school. There was no other reason whatever. If I might summarise the proceedings in regard to these things, I should say&#x2014;and I do not think it is open to denial&#x2014;that the local education authority, the West Riding County Council, were definitely and distinctly committing an illegal act contrary to the Education Act of 1902, which they were bound to administer. The Dewsbury governors, if they had complied with the requirements of the local education authority, would have been also performing an illegal act by disregarding Clause 47, which had been accepted all round and in consequence of which the school enjoyed its present position. Further&#x2014;and I do not think this can be denied&#x2014;the Board of Education used their power under the Endowed Schools Act by abrogating Clause 47 to enable the governors to do what would have been otherwise illegal, leaving the illegality of the local education authority exactly where it was; in fact, the Board of Education have really been using the power given to them under one Act of Parliament&#x2014;the Endowed Schools Act&#x2014;in order to violate the provisions of the Act of 1902 in regard to secondary schools.<lb/>
When we are told that it is difficult to interfere with authorities like the West Riding County Council, I should like to remind His Majesty's Government of the
<col>1044</col>
action of the Government in regard to local authorities in reference to the Small Holdings Act. What did Mr. Winston Churchill say in regard to that? He used the elegant expression that if the local authorities did not do what the Government thought right, they would have to "ginger" the local authorities. I believe that at this very moment the Board of Education is threatening to fine the London County Council to the extent of&#x00A3;50,000 if it does not do something which the Board of Education thinks necessary in regard to some of its schools.<lb/>
This is not the first time that this matter has been brought before Parliament. It was brought before the House of Commons a year or two ago, and Mr. Runciman in reply to a question, gave what I think was a very misleading account of what had occurred. He spoke about a "settlement that was pending between the Dewsbury governors and the local education authority," and said that "it was better to leave the thing quiet, and it was not for him to interfere until a settlement had been arrived at." Inasmuch as the Board of Education are responsible for the law in regard to these matters, I think their action is extremely like the case of a policeman standing by seeing a rough's hand in a lady's pocket taking her purse, and the lady appealing to the policeman for help and the policeman answering that he was waiting for a settlement to be arrived at&#x2014;the settlement taking the form of the purse being carried off and the thief getting away. A more unjust and illegal act than that proposed by the West Riding County Council, and anything more cowardly and less consistent with their duty than the action of the Education Department, I am incapable of conceiving.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01927"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not very fond of these discussions, and I do not think that most of your Lordships are very fond of them, but I feel that I ought to say a few words in order to correct a misapprehension which I think, after the speeches which have been made on behalf of the Government, might easily arise among those who only look superficially at the accounts in the newspapers of what takes place in your Lordships' House. I can well imagine its being said that what has been contended for on behalf of the Church&#x2014;it probably will be so put&#x2014;is a narrowing of liberty; and, in the next place, that what has been contended for is that
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0548"/>
<col>1045</col>
something should be done which is contrary to the wishes of the governing body of the school itself. I want, therefore, to controvert absolutely those two propositions.<lb/>
In the first place, it will very likely be said that this is one of the ordinary cases&#x2014;as some people outside would express it&#x2014;in which there is an endeavour on the part of the Church to restrict liberty in educational matters. The exact contrary is the case. If this scheme became law the liberty which now exists in the school as regards religious teaching would be restricted in a way that it has never been restricted before. It is true that the liberties restricted would be liberties now allowed to members of the Church of England; but that is no reason why its members should not have rights of conscience in such a matter, and secure for their children the teaching which the parents must definitely ask for if they wish their children to receive it. I have in my hands the rules which govern the giving of religious instruction in the school. They exclude nobody, and the regulation about denominational teaching is to the effect that religious instruction in Church of England doctrines shall only be given to pupils whose parents or guardians have in the manner specified requested the governors to provide such instruction, and no religious catechism or formulary distinctive of any particular denomination shall be taught in the school to any pupil whose parent or guardian has not made such request. What is proposed to be done, therefore, will restrict and not enlarge the liberty which now exists. I want to make that quite clear.<lb/>
In the next place, my Lords, it has been implied by the noble Viscount, whose forensic skill is an asset of very great value now added to his side of the House, that if we pass this Motion we shall be overriding the wishes of the governors of the school. The exact contrary would be the case. To make that quite clear let me quote from the report of the governors of the school upon the interview they had with the local education authority and the coercion that was applied to them. The governors state, in a letter to the Education Department in Whitehall, that on October 22, 1907, at a conference held at Wakefield, they were distinctly informed that although the Board of Education were satisfied with their acceptance of Article 5 (a), they, the county council, would accept nothing short of the absolute deletion of the denominational clause,
<col>1046</col>
Clause 47, of the scheme. The report goes on to say that it was also intimated that unless that was done absolutely and unconditionally, the West Riding County Council would not only refuse, as hitherto, to give any additional grants to the schools but would withdraw the grants they were then making&#x2014;namely, the&#x00A3;335 per annum. The tone of the local education authority was so uncompromising throughout that the governors felt that no arguments they could adduce would shake their resolution and the conference came to an abrupt conclusion. These unhappy men then went back, and finding that those central administrators on whom they had relied to support them in their resistance to an illegal condition were going to desert them, they had no resource hut practically to yield and lay down their arms. Can this, therefore, by any stretch of imagination be called an over-riding of the wishes of the governors? Exactly the contrary. What is being done is to enlarge the liberty of the school and to stand by the wishes of the local governors. Those are my reasons for supporting the Motion, much against the grain, for I dislike upsetting these schemes if it can possibly be helped. I am exceedingly thankful to know that the Government see their way not to let this scheme take effect. I do not think it would be right that it should go forth that this scheme is upset simply owing to the <i>force majeure</i> that exists in this House, because the truth is that it perishes owing to its inherent wrongness, and in this I am convinced that the country would quite agree if they had before them the particulars upon which to judge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01928"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been said that the West Riding County Council are acting in an illegal manner in threatening to withdraw their grants from this school if religious education is given in it. I notice that the noble Viscount based his argument on the fact that the county council have not acted in an illegal manner under the Act of 1902. That may be so. I do not question so expert an authority on the law as the noble Viscount. But, even if it is so, does he carry his argument so Far as to say that the Board of Education should enter into the arena of religious controversy? I understand that the ground on which the withdrawal of the grant is suggested is based entirely on the question of religious denominational teaching, and not on educational grounds. Secondly, it is said that the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0549"/>
<col>1047</col>
Board of Education were right in upholding the action of the county council. I should have thought that a great Department of the State such as the Board of Education would have been better advised in endeavouring to hold the balance equally between the parties in a matter of this sort, and not have taken the step of joining in what almost might be called a religious controversy. I think the action of the Board of Education under those circumstances ought rightly to be questioned in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01930"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member> rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies whether it is the intention of the Prime Minister to preside at the meetings of the Imperial Conference. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I will not detain the House long in asking this Question, and I hope I need not tell your Lordships that in what I am going to say there is not implied the slightest derogation from the office of the Secretary of State for the Colonies or the Statesman who now fills that post. What I would like briefly to point out to your Lordships is the view which is taken of this question&#x2014;you may think it an unimportant question, but it is not really so&#x2014;in our Dominions overseas. The Imperial Conference meets from time to time to discuss questions of co-operation&#x2014;what I may call the organisation of co-operation&#x2014;between the different parts of the Empire, and also questions of Imperial policy, and sometimes questions of general legislation, such as that of naturalisation which was discussed at the last Conference. These matters are really of vital importance, because although some of them may not appear as important as others, they are all links in the chain of that increased common co-operation which is becoming so increasingly important to the different parts of the Empire. Consequently the meetings of these Conferences are watched and their discussions followed with even greater attention in the Dominions than is perhaps the case in the United Kingdom. Therefore no one can say that the business which comes before these Conferences is unworthy of
<col>1048</col>
the attention of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01931">But it may be said that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is a very busy man, and it is not reasonable to expect that he should take an active part in these Conferences when he has a colleague whose special duty it is to do so. It is not in that way that the matter strikes the Dominions. They know that the Prime Minister is a very busy man, but the Prime Minister to them is a much greater person than any Member of his Cabinet. And if we think of the Cabinets and Governments of the Dominions themselves, how many of us can tell the names of the Cabinet Ministers, although we know the names of the Prime Ministers and follow their doings with great interest and attention. If that is the case here, it is very much more the case in the Dominions. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is a personality of absorbing interest in the Dominions, not equally so in the case of his colleagues, and from the Dominion point of view it is not easy for them to understand how the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom should not have time to preside at these Conferences when their own Prime Ministers find time to leave their Governments for months together, at the greatest possible inconvenience to the administration and to their Parliamentary work, because of the all-absorbing importance of the Imperial Conference. At the earlier Conferences the Prime Ministers of the Dominions came to England, but the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom took no part in the proceedings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01932">At the last Conference, if I remember rightly, the Prime Minister did welcome the members of the Conference in the first instance, and then he left the presidency over the deliberations to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. It is my earnest hope that on this occasion a better precedent is going to be set, and that at all the really important sessions and sittings of the Conference the Prime Minister himself will find time to preside over the deliberations. I can assure His Majesty's Government that that decision would be welcomed throughout all the Dominions of the Empire. The action would be immensely appreciated. If, unfortunately, the old rule should prevail, I think there will be a very serious disposition on the part of some of the Dominions to think that the
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0550"/>
<col>1049</col>
action of their. Prime Ministers has not met with the response on this side that it deserves. Because, my Lords, if you try to picture to yourselves the complete dislocation of Parliamentary business in South Africa, or in Australia, or in Canada, when the Prime Minister and one or more of the principal Ministers leave for several weeks or even for two months together, it must appear to them almost impossible to believe that, if they can do that, hard worked as he is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom cannot find time to preside at the more important sessions of the Conference. I have ventured to put this matter briefly before your Lordships in the full anticipation and hope that the general sense of my remarks is shared by His Majesty's Government. I beg to ask the question standing in my name.</p>

<title>COUNTY COURTS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01934" align="center"><b>[SECOND READING.]</b></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01935">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01936"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR. (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have very few words to say in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, because this is really the same Bill as was brought forward by me and read a second time in your Lordships' House two years ago. I think the general scheme of it commends itself to all of your Lordships who have considered it, but there is one part which caused the wreck of the Bill two years ago to which I must advert for a few moments. It is this. The first clause proposes that any action which otherwise belongs to the King's Bench Division may be brought in the County Court by any plaintiff if he pleases, but that there should be an absolute right on the part of the defendant, if he does not wish it to be tried in the County Court, to remove it to the High Court. The only difference that is made between the existing law by that is this, that whereas the plaintiff
<col>1050</col>
and the defendant may now, if they like, agree to try the case in the County Court, if this Bill passes the plaintiff will be able to put it down in the first instance without agreement, subject to the absolute right of the defendant to remove it to the High Court. The object in allowing the plaintiff to enter it in the County Court without agreement is that it is perhaps not likely that parties who are in litigation with each other will care to come to any agreement, but if the one takes the step without having to consult; the other it is presumed that the other will agree. That, my Lords, is the whole scope of the Bill.<lb/>
The Bill does not go nearly so far as a proposal made by Lord Cairns thirty years ago upon a recommendation of a Select Committee. The Select Committee on that Bill consisted of Lord Cairns, Lord Selborne, Lord Blackburn, Lord Hatherley, and the present Marquess of Lansdowne. My proposal does not go so far as theirs did. It has also received the approval, within the last three or four years, of a Committee presided over by my noble friend Lord Gorell I am almost ashamed to waste so much time in presenting so small an amendment to your Lordships, but when this Bill was last brought before the House of Lords it was objected to in Committee&#x2014;as I am bound to say nearly every legal reform is&#x2014;more strenuously. I am sorry to say, by members of my own profession than by any lay member of your Lordships' House. I am very sorry to say that a most distinguished law reformer as well as a very great legal authority, the noble Earl who preceded me on the Woolsack, disapproves of this clause. I shall be prepared to try and meet him in arguing it when the Bill goes into Committee, but I may say with great sincerity how deeply I regret that I am hot able to have his support on this occasion, because I recognise to the full, not only his great authority, but also the distinguished services he has rendered to the law. All I would say further is that the Bill which I say goes further than this Bill&#x2014;Lord Cairns's Bill&#x2014;is to be found at page 359 of the House of Lords Bills of 1878 and 1879. I venture to hope that the-Second Reading of this Bill will be given now, and that your Lordships will kindly consider the Bill in the interval and enable me to retrieve the disaster that I suffered two years ago.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01938"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I very much regret that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will not acquiesce in deleting the clause which seems to me to be entirely unnecessary for his Bill, and which I think will add a great deal to the jurisdiction of the County Courts, and detract from their value as the poor man's Court. I think one ought to know what the noble and learned Lord proposes to do. Not altogether respectfully, I think, to your Lordships' House after the discussion we had on the previous Bill&#x2014;and there was a very full discussion of the subject when this clause was negatived&#x2014;the noble and learned Lord dropped the Bill entirely, and I should like to know what is going to happen on the occasion of the present Bill if your Lordships again negative the clause. The reason I ask that is this. There are a great many provisions in this Bill which I think are extremely useful, and which I should be very glad to see added to the law; but the noble and learned Lord insists upon having an additional amount of jurisdiction given to the County Courts. I do not know whether it formed part of Lord Cairns's Bill, and I really do not care; because that which makes me oppose the present proposal is that it has inflicted a great deal of injustice upon the poorer class of suitors to have had jurisdiction piled on the County Courts from time to time so that occasionally it is absolutely impossible for a poor suitor to get his case heard in the County Court within a reasonable period. Probably we shall have to discuss this at greater length hereafter, and therefore I will not weary your Lordships at present with any further discussion of it.<lb/>
I will say definitely only this, that from time to time every County Court in the country is over loaded with work. County Court Judges have a circuit to go, and from time to time they are required to announce months beforehand the period that they will occupy with the administration of their Courts. The result of that is that from time to time the County Court Judge is unable to perform the circuit in the specified time. These addings to the jurisdiction operate in this way, that the County Court Judge cannot finish his Court on such and such a day, and has to go back again, and on the occasion when he goes back he may have to adjourn once more. I have heaps of statistics here which perhaps hereafter I may have to call your Lordships' attention to, from which it appears that sometimes
<col>1052</col>
as many as three or four times the County Court Judge has to go back again to finish the cause. When one looks at what County Court Judges were instituted for and sees the mode in which every kind of jurisdiction has been heaped upon them, it will be seen that they cannot help adjourning their cases as they have to do, and I am not complaining of the County Court Judges for doing so. It is absolutely impossible for them to alter the periods that have already been mapped out by them, and which have been made operative by law. They have to keep their appointments, and they cannot help adjourning. The tendency has been from time to time to increase and add to the jurisdiction, so that the poor man's Court is now absolutely absorbed by persons for whom the County Court was never intended. I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord himself is the author of the Bill. I cannot help suspecting that there is a Treasury scent about it. There is a sort of notion of sparing some expense.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01940"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Well, I am sorry. I have the greatest possible confidence in and respect for the noble and learned Lord's views. I think he was good enough to say the last time we discussed this Bill that I did not know much about County Courts. He is entirely mistaken. I may inform him that the greater part of my earlier career as a barrister was occupied almost continually in County Courts. I had a general retainer for the London and North-Western Railway, and from time to time I was occupied in County Courts in every part of the country. I do not think the noble and learned Lord's own experience of County Courts is so great. His was a much higher and loftier course of practice. But be that as it may, the undoubted fact is that the County Courts are now congested in almost every place, and I have received earnest remonstrances from the Bar Council on the subject. I noted what the noble and learned Lord said with regard to lawyers, and undoubtedly he was able to raise a laugh at the expense of lawyers who were not law reformers. But, my Lords, I think he is mistaken. I think that the greatest law reformers we have seen in our time have been lawyers. But be that as it may, there is a great and crying injustice at present going on from time
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0552"/>
<col>1053</col>
to time with regard to our County Courts, as I will show hereafter. The amount of business to be done in the County Courts is so great that the Judges have not time to do it. I have one case here in which it took eighteen months, and three different visits to the County Court Judge's jurisdiction, to finish one case. There is no reason for increasing the jurisdiction of the County Courts at all. I have the best authority for saying that the superior Courts are quite abreast of their work, and there is no reason, therefore, why you should endeavour to relieve the superior Courts and thrust this additional work upon the County Courts and so absolutely prevent and hinder that jurisdiction which was intended primarily for the poor.<lb/>
There is another question which seems to me very much allied, and which requires serious attention. From time to time those who were intended to be really clerks and registrars are made into Judges for the smaller class of eases. Then you have another jurisdiction given as to the amount which people can pay, what their means are, and how much they can pay within such and such a time. That has been remitted to another class of persons. Then there is, what I think is still more objectionable, in order to relieve the congestion which has been created, a set of Judges appointed <i>pro hac vice</i>, and when their Judicial duties are over they return to the Bar. I can hardly conceive anything more objectionable than this continual oscillation between an advocate looking for business and a Judge enjoying a Judgeship for a week or a month. That seems to me to be calculated to&#x2014;I will not use so strong a phrase as corrupt&#x2014;but at all events to deteriorate the tone of the Bar. I say sincerely that I have great respect for the Bar. I believe it to be most useful in all respects for the administration of justice; but I do not think that this practice is calculated to increase either the honour or the usefulness of the Bar.<lb/>
In regard to this Bill I think one ought to know what the situation is. If the Lord Chancellor says he will not pass this Bill, notwithstanding a great many of the useful sections which are in it, unless he has this primary provision which involves an alteration of the whole system of the administration of justice, it seems to me to be neither respectful to this House nor
<col>1054</col>
calculated to aid the spirit in which I am sure the Lord Chancellor himself would desire the debate to be conducted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01941"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not going to inflict any discussion upon your Lordships with regard to the merits of this clause. This is not the right time to do so. There are many arguments in addition to those which have been mentioned by my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury which require to be considered. But it is quite impossible for me to remain silent at the present stage after the speech which was made by the Lord Chancellor, because it places me in an extremely difficult position. This first clause has nothing to do with County Court administration properly so-called. It. is a clause which relates to the business of the High Court, as to which I ought, of course, to know something; and I do respectfully enter my protest, not for the first time, against the attempt to discount what may be said by those who have convictions on this matter by saying that they only oppose this clause because they are lawyers. I can say, speaking for myself, that that is not a just observation. There is no instance in my career, either in the House of Commons or here, which would justify the Lord Chancellor in suggesting that I would oppose any reform in the law or that I would oppose this particular clause in his Bill because I, as a lawyer, oppose every legal reform. The whole of my record is contrary to that. Therefore I respectfully protest against what we may say, from our convictions, being discounted on the ground that we oppose because we are lawyers. It is an observation the injustice of which I feel deeply, and I am sorry that it has been introduced to-night.<lb/>
We ought in fairness to know whether or not this Bill is again going to be wrecked because we cannot agree with this clause. I have the greatest respect, and the Lord Chancellor knows it, for his judgment, and would gladly co-operate with him in every way I could; but I cannot subordinate all I know about this matter into a mere position of obedience. I wish this Bill to be read a second time. There are many clauses in it which I think ought to be passed. I support the greater part of them, and I deeply regretted that useful amendments which are wanted in the law with regard to our County Courts were withdrawn when the Bill was last before
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0553"/>
<col>1055</col>
your Lordships' House because of the view taken with regard to the first clause, which, as I have said, has nothing to do with County Court administration at all but which is really a question entirely of High Court work. There are many things I could say about this Bill, but I am not going to inflict them upon you to-night. I would ask the Lord Chancellor, however, whether it is quite just not to tell us whether we are afterwards to be held up as having wrecked this Bill unless we agree to the first clause of it. We never have wrecked the Bill. We have discussed a clause, a clause of very great importance, and have not agreed with it.<lb/>
I can assure the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack that there are great objections to this proposal&#x2014;objections which I shall be able to bring before your Lordships' house at a later stage. They may or may not commend themselves to the Lord Chancellor. I hope they will; but I trust at any rate, that he will understand that I am not here opposing the clause because I am a lawyer, and that he will give a little consideration to the reasons which I shall have to urge against this clause when the Bill goes into Committee. But, my Lords, I must say that the position does not seem to me right or just to those of us who feel greatly the responsibility of opposing the Lord Chancellor in such a matter as this. The noble and learned Lord comes down to your Lordships' House with all the weight of his great position, and the lay members of the House must naturally think that the opinion of the Lord Chancellor on such a matter is worth a great deal more than the opinion of anybody else. Therefore it is most difficult to be in a position of opposition, and I feel it most keenly. I feel that I have to approach this discussion with a sort of sword of Damocles suspended over my head&#x2014;"if you do not agree to this clause the Bill does not go on, and you will again be held up as the persons who wrecked the Bill." I most respectfully protest. I have no wish to wreck the Bill, and I am not a wrecker of the Bill in arguing against this clause. On the contrary, I desire to see the Bill made law.<lb/>
My Lords, I cannot shelve my responsibility on to other people's shoulders. I have now for eleven years had the great honour of being the head of the King's Bench Division, and I know perfectly well
<col>1056</col>
the needs of that Division. I know perfectly well what difficulties there are, and I am grateful to the Lord Chancellor and to the recommendations of his Committee which have enabled us and other Judges to come abreast of the work; but I do enter my most respectful protest against the speech which he made, with all the weight and authority of the Lord Chancellor, which practically is intended to&#x2014;or if it is not intended to it will have that effect&#x2014;discount any arguments that we may put forward to the House against this particular clause of the noble and learned Lord's Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01942"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may ask your Lordships' indulgence for a few moments, as I was Chairman of the Committee which reported on the question of the improvement of the County Courts. The effect of this Bill, as I read it, is to embody the main points which the Report of our Committee put forward as valuable for the improvement of County Court procedure, practice, and jurisdiction. Therefore I would like to say a few words at this stage as to why I think the first clause should be retained, even though there are many other clauses independent of it which might be considered and which would be of value without Clause 1.<lb/>
The first clause really goes further hack than even my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack thinks&#x2014;or perhaps it has escaped his recollection. It goes hack really to the year 1872, and is taken from the first Report of the Judicature Commissioners of that year. The majority of those Commissioners reported at that time that the County Courts should be constituent parts of the High Court, and, in effect, should have unlimited jurisdiction, with a right of removal over a certain limit. I do not know whether they fixed upon the limit at that time, but substantially the clause that was framed as a result of the Report of that Committee goes back as far as 1872. If anybody studies with care what is called by some the evolution of the County Courts, he will find that these Courts began by being Courts for persons who claimed something like a sum not exceeding&#x00A3;20. That was in the year 1846. From that time to the present there has been a development in the powers, jurisdiction, and proceedings of County Courts, which was in answer, I think, to a demand for local
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0554"/>
<col>1057</col>
facilities of an economical character. There are in the Report which we framed something like four pages cataloguing the Acts which have given additional jurisdiction to the County Courts. There are, in addition to these detailed Acts, the Acts which give jurisdiction of an unlimited character to the County Courts in bankruptcy, which is of a very extensive character. There are also Acts which give a large Admiralty jurisdiction to the County Courts. That has been the movement of the last fifty years, and it is a movement, based, I venture to suggest, upon economic and local facilities.<lb/>
This clause continues that idea by doing very little more than using a certain amount of play upon human nature to avoid the difficulty which exists if you proceed to ask for consent. There is absolutely no increase of jurisdiction implied in this Bill. It is a mistake to think that there is. Parties can agree at this moment to take any Common Law case they please in the County Courts without any limit whatever, with the exception of a few cases such as libel and slander cases, which are expressly exempted from the operation of this Bill. What does the Bill propose? Your Lordships are not asked to do anything more than to facilitate what parties wish to do. It only proposes that the plaintiff shall begin his action in the County Court, and the defendant, if it is over the present limit, may say, "I object to that; you must go on in the High Court." In other words, it gives power to object instead of requiring consent. It is perfectly obvious why that should be done. It is because it is a most difficult thing to approach a solicitor, or a party with whom you are in litigation, and ask for consent to anything; but if you begin the action in a local Court, which would mean economy, it is much more natural that the defendant would not object to it going there than give his consent if he were asked to give it before hand. That is the whole change which is so much objected to.<lb/>
I venture to ask, Why is it objected to? It is objected to because it is said&#x2014;I say this with the greatest deference to what was said by the noble and learned Earl opposite&#x2014;that it would swamp the poor man's Court and prevent his cases from being heard. So far from doing that, it will get rid of those very difficulties to
<col>1058</col>
which the noble Earl referred, and to which the Bar Council has referred. When those cases are examined into I venture to say they will be found to be exceedingly small in number, and to arise entirely from the present working of the County Courts. At the present time County Court Judges are obliged to nominate in advance specific days for their sittings. I think it is once a month they have to be at every place on their circuit. They cannot possibly know what work they will get there. They find ordinary business, such as committing people to prison, small debts to be enforced, and so on, and then they suddenly find a large case put into the day's list. By that system it is perfectly impossible that there will not be difficulties and lengthy adjournments. That is the present system. But if this Bill is carried, the procedure which is suggested is that any case which is of a larger class of case should be taken at a special sitting with lists arranged and at a central place selected for the purpose of taking that particular kind of case. That system, instead of increasing the difficulty of work of the County. Courts, would in my opinion decrease it. Then with regard to the point that the County Court Judges are overworked, I do not think it will be found that County Court Judges are by any means overworked. I believe the average total number of days in the year on which the County Court Judges sit is about 150.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01943"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: 153.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01944"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: I do not believe, even if there was some extra time allotted for special sittings to deal with such cases as they are likely to get, that there would be any material difficulty, by proper adjustment, in County Court Judges coping with that class of work. The third alteration that is made by this Bill is an important one. It is proposed that Registrars should, unless the parties object, have power to deal with all debts under&#x00A3;5. Anybody who studies the statistics of the County Courts will find that an enormous percentage of the cases are under&#x00A3;5; and if jurisdiction to deal with those cases&#x2014;many of them being undefended&#x2014;were conferred upon the Registrars, the time of the County Court Judges for heavier cases would be largely increased, and they would be able to cope with better work than simply dealing with little undefended matters which do not take them more than a moment or two to decide. Another matter
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0555"/>
<col>1059</col>
is this. If these cases should happen to be of any length, it is quite easy to provide that, on application to the Judge, they should be transferred, or sent: to an Official Referee if the Judge finds the intricacies of the case such as to require a longer hearing than can be allowed without delaying his smaller cases.<lb/>
If this matter is investigated I think it will be found that there is no real difficulty in carrying out the proposals which this Bill puts forward. Secondly, are they wanted? The answer seems to be this. There is the development of the County Court which I have already indicated, and there is this further point that since the Act of 1903 introduced by the late Government extending County Court jurisdiction from&#x00A3;50 to&#x00A3;100, there have been a large number of cases taken above the&#x00A3;100 limit, amounting to 573 three years ago&#x2014;those are the last statistics I have&#x2014;in the County Courts, and 151 in the City of London Court. The total of those is more than the total number of cases disposed of by the High Court on circuit&#x2014;that is to say, the consent jurisdiction, as it exists, has produced something like 700 cases which are taken by consent in the County Court at the present time, and all that this Bill proposes is to change that consent into a want of objection. I have dealt with this part of the question because one of the main grounds of objection appears to be that you will overwork the County Courts and prevent them from operating on their proper work. For the reasons I have given, I cannot believe that that is so at all; and as to the rest of the Bill, there are most valuable provisions in it which might very well go through, subject to some criticisms, even though the first clause were not adopted. I am sorry to have spoken so long, but some of these matters that I have dealt with are matters of importance, and it is worth while to bring them out now at an early stage of the proceedings with regard to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01945"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say a very few words in reply. In the first place I would say that I have made no attack upon any profession, least of all upon my own, of which I am immensely proud. But if you look at the history of legal reform I am sure you will find that any one, however experienced in the law, who proposes law reform never receives
<col>1060</col>
much encouragement from the lay public, and not infrequently his proposals are met with objections&#x2014;perfectly conscientious objections, I have no doubt&#x2014;from members of the legal profession; and that is the reason why so many things in the administration of the law are a reproach to-day. May I give your Lordships one illustration in all goodwill. Your Lordships will remember three or four years ago when I brought forward the Criminal Appeal Bill how my noble and learned friend came down to the House and said, I have no doubt honestly believing it, and speaking on behalf of all of His Majesty's Judges, that it would be destructive of the administration of justice in criminal cases in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01946"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble and learned Lord's pardon. I did not say that. I referred entirely to appeals on question of fact, which have never been lawful before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01947"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend is under a misapprehension. The whole point was with regard to appeals on questions of fact. That was what the Bill was for. Yet it had not become law a week before every man in the country knew that it was a success and was necessary for the administration of justice, and no one admitted more generously than my noble friend himself that the Bill was indispensable to the administration of justice. That, my Lords, is an illustration of the kind of difficulty which any one bringing forward law reforms has to meet at the hands of the legal profession. After all, this clause is a very small thing. It simply means that one person may do a certain thing to begin with and the other person may object if he chooses to do so. It is said that this will overwhelm the County Court Judges with work. Your Lordships will find the statistics with regard to the daily work of the County Court Judges in the Judicial Statistics published every year. I examined them last year and found, unless my recollection fails me, that the County Court Judges do on an average 153 days' work in the course of the. year. I wish I only did 153 days' work in the year. I should be very well satisfied to do 300 days' work in the year and very much improve my present work, and so would most of the working people of the country. Is it tolerable to be told that in the case of Judges who only do 153 days' work in the course of the year
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0556"/>
<col>1061</col>
that they are so overwhelmed that their work cannot be added to? It cannot be supported.<lb/>
Might I ask the noble and learned Earl, if he will, to let me know beforehand the statistics that he intends to rely upon when the argument comes on in the Committee stage. If they are right, I will admit them at once; but I should like very much to have an opportunity of knowing what those statistics are, because I know, not only front the statistics which I possess but also from my communications with County Court Judges themselves, that it is not the case that there are any arrears in the work of the County Courts. If there were arrears, we should very soon have notice taken of them. I am very sorry to have occupied so long with this, but we are most anxious to try and make justice cheap in this country if we can, and enable people to try their cases in Courts near at hand and not compel them to incur the expense of coming to the High Court with cases of the kind with which this Bill deals. We want people to be able to have their cases tried cheaply, if we can, and this Bill only enables people to do it who are willing to do it. I venture to predict that, unless we take some step of the kind in the way of law reform, your Lordships will find the Chambers of Commerce and the commercial classes of this country becoming vocal on the matter before long. I have had experience of this feeling from deputations I have received on the subject.<lb/>
Then the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, asked me if I would say whether I was going to drop the Bill if this clause was not passed. If I do not proceed with the Bill there is nothing to prevent anybody else from taking it up. It is not a fair thing to say to a Minister who brings in his considered proposals in the shape of a Bill, "We propose to excise some of the clauses, but we ask you to be good enough to proceed with the rest." if this clause is omitted I do not propose to proceed with the rest. But that does not prevent my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury or any other member of your Lordships' House taking up my Bill. I have not the least objection to that being done; but I do not think it is fair to say to a Minister, "We will cut out the best and most important part of your Bill and you must be content with the rest." It seems to
<col>1062</col>
me to be treating him more like a schoolboy than a responsible person.</membercontribution></p>

Whether Engineer Commanders on promotion to that rank from the rank of Engineer Lieutenant always receive the pay of 24<i>s</i>. a day, according to the scale laid down in Admiralty Circular Letter, No. 140 of 19th December 1902, or not. Whether, when in November, 1903, the promotion of Engineer Lieutenants to Engineer Commanders was temporarily accelerated front eight years to four years on the senior list, it was made clear that such promotions were to be treated in the matter of minimum pay exceptionally and not according to the scale laid down in Circular Letter No. 140; and, if so, how this distinction of treatment was made clear, and when these temporary accelerations of promotion will cease, and the minimum rate of pay for Engineer Commander really become 24<i>s</i>. a day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01950"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question my noble friend asks refers to the time when he was First Lord of the Admiralty. The actual point in dispute is with reference to a Circular Letter issued by the Admiralty on November 1, 1903. This Circular Letter states as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, having reviewed the Regulations governing the promotion, relative rank, &amp;c., of the Medical, Accountant, and Engineer Officers of the Royal Navy, have decided to introduce the following changes therein."</quote>
I will simply state the one point which I think is relevant&#x2014;
<quote>"Engineer Lieutenants on the Senior List will be promoted to Engineer Commander after four years on the Senior List instead of eight. In connection with this alteration the descriptive portions of the existing scales of full pay for Engineer Lieutenants (Senior List) and Engineer Commanders are amended as follows."</quote>
Then they are set out. I think the whole trouble has arisen from the words, "descriptive portions." I do not think that this Circular Letter was particularly well drafted, but be that as it may, I do not
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0557"/>
<col>1063</col>
think the Admiralty can be accused in any way of breaking their pledges. What did my noble friend do? He introduced an improved scale of pay. He reduced the time in the rank of engineer cadet from5 to 4 years. He reduced the period of service of Engineer sub-Lieutenants from 6 years to 2&#x00BD;years. He established a fixed period of 8 years for the Engineer Lieutenants on the Junior List in place of the variable period extending to 10&#x00BD;years in the past; and in that case what happens now is that every Engineer Lieutenant is bound to get his promotion after 8 years on the Senior List. As a matter of fact now, owing to accelerated promotion, he gets it in 4, but previous to my noble friend's amendments it was generally 10&#x00BD;or even longer. I may also state that the pay at present of an Engineer Commander is 18s.; after 2 years service he gets&#x00A3;1, and after 4 years' service&#x00A3;14s. That means that 8 years after he is advanced to the Senior List of Engineer Lieutenants he gets&#x00A3;1 4s., as stated in the original Memorandum issued by the noble Earl in December, 1902. I really do not think that the engineering branch of the Navy have anything to complain of, especially in view of the fact that the noble Earl, when First Lord of the Admiralty, expended over&#x00A3;27,000 a year extra in the way of pay to that particular branch.</membercontribution></p>

I understand that the accelerated promotion will cease after 1912. The other question that I omitted to answer was when every Engineer Commander in the Navy would get a minimum pay of&#x00A3;1 4s. a day. That period will not be reached, I am afraid, before the year 1922, but there is a possibility that it may be reached at a somewhat earlier date.</membercontribution></p>

I have since been informed that it was not necessary to put it down exactly in that way, and I desire to say at once that it is only to one subsection of one clause of this scheme that I have to take any objection. That subsection is subsection (b) of Clause 19. It would have been perfectly satisfactory, so far as I am concerned, if the words "The governors may permit" could have been struck out, and also the proviso at the end of the subsection providing that "such instruction shall be given in the Welsh language to children of Welsh parents." Those are the only things to which I object. May I say on this point&#x2014;I shall be corrected if I am wrong&#x2014;that I have some hope that the Government will not object to cutting out the proviso as to giving instruction necessarily in the Welsh language to children of Welsh parents.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01955">If so, my objection is narrowed down to the other point. The words are&#x2014;
<quote>"The Governors may permit the said school buildings to be used on Sundays for the purpose of classes for religious instruction&#x2026;subject to a payment sufficient only to defray the expenses incidental to such user."</quote>
The whole question is, Is it fair and right that a permissive power should be given to the new governing body, instead of the right being maintained for the rector of the parish of Llanenddwyn to continue to give, as has been given for 100 years without any break, religious instruction in the principles of the Church of England in this school? I admit that, so far as I know, it is not stated in the original will of Mrs. Ellin Humphrey that it should be a Church of England school, and that instruction in the principles of the Church of England should be given in it; but I think that may be assumed from the nature of the trustees who were appointed, one of them being the rector of this parish of Llanenddwyn. another a landed proprietor close by&#x2014;I forget at this moment the name&#x2014;and a third the rector of another parish. Ever since that time it has always been considered a Church of England school as far as I can make out, and religious instruction has always been given in it. As a proof of what I have said,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0558"/>
<col>1065</col>
in 1835 an application was made to the Government for a grant for the rebuilding of the school. That application was made through the National Society, which seems clearly to prove that at that time it was considered a Church of England school. If it had not been, the application would have been made through the British and Foreign School Society. I do not believe that there has been any dispute about its being a Church of England school in the sense that ever since its foundation religious instruction of that kind has been given in it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01956">But now we come to the present actual point of the Sunday School. All that I now maintain is that the right of using this School for a Sunday School should be preserved. There is no proposal at this moment to maintain the school entirely as a Church of England school. But I do ask that the right which the rector of Llanenddwyn has always had, and which as far as I can make out has always been admitted, should continue. The Board of Education now in its scheme give a permissive power to the new governors. It says that they may permit the school buildings to be used on Sundays for the purposes of these classes, and they know that there can be no possibility of their pledging any future governors to continue this permission. I have here a letter signed by the secretary of the Merionethshire Education Committee, Mr. Haydn Jones, now Member of Parliament for Merionethshire. This was written in 1909, when this scheme was being discussed. He says that he hears that objection is taken to this part of the scheme and he writes&#x2014;
<quote>."In these circumstances we desire to give you the fullest assurance in oar power that, so far as we know, there is no ground fur any such fears."</quote>
That is, fears that the permission will not be given; and he goes on later on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Whilst we cannot, of course, pledge the new governing body, we feel sure that they will not repudiate an honourable understanding."</quote>
I would point out that no future governing body can possibly be pledged in this way merely on the assertion of the secretary of the Merionethshire Education Committee; and if it is the intention of that education committee to give this permission to the rector of the parish to continue the Sunday school, why is it that it should not be stated in the scheme? This is
<col>1066</col>
only with regard to a Sunday School, and I do ask the Government, if they possibly can, to meet me in this, and give some definite assurance that it will not be left merely to the caprice of a governing body, but that the power shall remain in the hands of the rector of the parish to continue, the Sunday School there which has been carried on for so long. I think the point is really narrowed down to that, and I have very great hope that the noble Earl opposite who is going to deal with this may be able to give me the assurance that at least there will be some greater certainty than is given in the words of the scheme as it stands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01957"><i>Moved</i>, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying His Majesty to withhold his consent from so much of the scheme settled by the Board of Education for the administration of the Educational Foundation of Ellin Humphrey, in the parishes of Llanenddwyn and Llanddwywe, in the country of Merioneth, as is contained in the proviso to clause 19 (b) of the said scheme.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Plymouth</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01958"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Earl has correctly said, there are really only two points to be dealt with in regard to this scheme. First, as to the question of the Welsh language, I should not offer any objection to an amendment of this scheme which did away with the proviso with regard to the use of the Welsh language. Might I, however, say, to explain why it found a position in the scheme, that it was an attempt, however misguided, to follow out the provisions of the original will of Mrs. Ellin Humphrey.<lb/>
The other point is whether the word "may" or "shall" should be used. There is, I think, no discussion between the noble Earl and myself as to the facts of this case. We agree that there is no special denominational principle indicated in the will of Mrs. Ellin Humphrey, and we also agree that the Church of England has had the use of this school for a very long time, in spite of the absence of any words to that effect in the will. I think that quite clearly in the circumstances this is an occasion for compromise. The noble Earl has expressed himself as satisfied with an assurance which he received in a letter from the secretary of the Education Committee of the Merionethshire County Council.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-01962"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: In those circumstances I am able to make him an offer, which I hope he will regard with satisfaction. It is this, that a resolution of the county council shall be passed binding themselves to see that the use is given in fact, if the permissive words are retained in the scheme. The noble Earl will, of course, understand that that is as far as I can go; but I can assure him that that offer is made by a person who I believe is fully competent to see that that resolution is passed by the council.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01963"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF BANGOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there seems to be a little confusion about Mrs. Humphrey's will. It is perfectly true that there was nothing denominational in the will, but the money willed did not build the school. Mrs. Ellin Humphrey left&#x00A3;200, or something like that, to provide an amount of instruction by a schoolmaster in the Welsh language in reading and writing. She was the daughter of a former rector, but she did not erect this building. Not a penny, as far as I can understand, left by her, went to the building; but she, by her will, gave free judgment to the trustees&#x2014;the rector of the parish, a local gentleman, and a clergyman of another parish. By that will they had control of this money to pay a teacher to hold classes in Welsh in reading and writing.<lb/>
I find from a charge delivered by one of my predecessors about 1809 that he urged the clergy of the diocese in the strongest possible terms to take up the provision of schools all through the diocese. I do not think any charge could possibly have been stronger. I also find that during that time an enormous amount of school building went on in the diocese; the clergy almost everywhere, if they could not get land, gave up their own scanty glebes to provide sites. I remember
<col>1068</col>
going to one place not very far from the district in question where I think out of nine sites five were provided out of the glebe. The trustees of Mrs. Humphrey were naturally anxious to carry out her wishes and they applied for a site and built a school, and from that day to this that school has been recognised as a Church of England school. Can you have a clearer title than that? Can you say that although this particular building was put up by the trustees of an undenominational trust, yet this building put up by them and used as a school and recognised as a Church of England school is not a Church of England school? You have, again, this evidence that it was the practice of the Government to aid in the building of Church of England and Nonconformist schools alike, but if it was a Nonconformist school they did it through the British and Foreign Society, and if it was a Church of England school they gave the grant through the National Society. Here the Government, recognising it to be a Church school, gave the grant through the National Society.<lb/>
In this scheme it is proposed to say that the clergyman is only to hold his Sunday school classes by permission of a certain governing body, of which be is in the proportion of one to seven. It is only a little village building, but, after all, it is to my mind as strong a case of confiscation as you can well have. The Merionethshire County Council have said that they have no wish to disturb the user. But when people come to an ordinary understanding upon ordinary matters of business, it is usually reduced to writing, and why cannot this be reduced to writing and put into a proper form&#x2014;that the clergyman is to have the use of this building uninterruptedly for a Sunday school? The noble Earl has tried to meet us in perfect good faith, and what he has said at the moment I quite acknowledge is satisfactory; but, after all, it is a somewhat cumbrous undertaking, because the people who are to decide this question are the governors themselves. The Merionethshire County Council are the people whose pledge the noble Earl gives, but I do not understand, supposing the local governors say it is not to be used, how the county council are going to fulfil their pledge.<lb/>
I do not want to dwell upon the question of instruction in the Welsh language,
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0560"/>
<col>1069</col>
because, as I say, Mrs. Ellin Humphrey never built the school, and it seemed to me an absurd provision on the face of it. A clergyman would know best in his own Sunday school what kind of instruction ought to be given; he has no power of compelling attendance. There are in our Sunday Schools in Wales a large number of classes in Welsh and a large number of classes in English. If the parents want their children instructed in Welsh and the clergyman gives it in English the children will not come, and <i>vice versa</i>, so the clergyman will give the instruction the people want. In this particular parish there are a large number of people who speak English and a large number who speak Welsh, and I should have been glad if the noble Earl could have met us a little further. I know he has done the best he can see his way to do at this moment; bat I should have been very glad indeed if he could have gone a little further and, without wrecking the scheme, have given an assurance that in the case of this building&#x2014;which, after all, was no part of the original charity but was put up by the trustees for the purpose of Church of England education, and which has been used for 100 years by the Church of England&#x2014;the clergymen should be allowed without let or hindrance to give religious instruction on Sundays as heretofore.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-01964"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not surprised that the right rev. Prelate who presides with such success over his important diocese should be anxious to secure to the very utmost the rights of the Church of England for this school. But we are practical men and as practical men we must look at the situation as we find it, and I must say the noble Earl has met us in a very conciliatory spirit in respect of this Motion this evening. What does his speech amount to? It amounts to this, that in respect to one part of my noble friend's amendment of the scheme, he has entirely conceded the point. The whole of the proviso is to disappear. Then there remains the question of the Sunday school. Having in years past had some little acquaintance with this subject, I have no doubt that the pious founder intended it to be a Church of England school; if not, she would not have made the rector of the parish an <i>ex officio</i> trustee of the school. But that does not give it a Church of England character within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, and
<col>1070</col>
therefore we cannot put forward a strictly legal right to treat it as a Church of England school. All we have is an equitable claim dependent on time certainty that we feel as to the founder's intentions, and on the fact that ever since this building has been erected it has been used for Church of England Sunday school purposes. I do not think the noble Earl recognises our equitable right to the full, but he admits that there are equitable considerations which must be taken into account, and on behalf of the county council he assures your Lordships that the Merionethshire County Council recognise these equitable considerations and are prepared to use their power in order to see that this school shall continue to be used as a Church of England Sunday school as heretofore. That is not all we ask for, but You cannot get all you ask for in this world: and I think my noble friend ought to be satisfied with what he has been able to get, and that he is to be congratulated, on behalf of the Church of England and of this 'particular Foundation, that lie has been able to obtain so much.</membercontribution></p>

On the other hand, I have read the Amendments proposed by my noble friend behind me to meet these points, but I am not sure that difficulties would not then arise in other ways. It seems to me very desirable that we should have the advantage of the assistance of the Government draftsman, and, if possible, of the Law Officers in regard to this Bill. I therefore suggest that, if your Lordships agree, the measure should be referred to a Joint Committee of the two Houses, in order that it may be thoroughly sifted and put into shape before it comes up again for the consideration of the House. There are undoubtedly points which require closer consideration than it is possible to give on an occasion like this. I am not prepared to suggest Amendments with regard to the provisions of the Bill without a good deal of consideration, and, possibly, some assistance; and if your Lordships thought fit to take the course I have suggested, I would move that the Bill should be referred to a Joint Committee of the two Houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02019"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the suggestion which the noble Viscount has made seems a very reasonable and wise one. It is obvious to any one with legal attainments, or even to any one without legal attainments, who reads the Bill that it bristles with points that require consideration and possibly amendment, and therefore I think it is wiser to thresh the matter out in a Joint Committee of both Houses, where it could be thoroughly
<col>1076</col>
discussed. There are points raising matters of law and involving technicalities that require a good deal of examination, and it would be wise that the Bill should go to a Joint Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02020"><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need hardly say that the course proposed by His Majesty's Government is an agreeable one to me. I recognise the great difficulty of arguing the technical points that arise on this Bill in Committee of the whole House, and it seems to me that the subject would be better ventilated by the reference of the Bill to a Joint Committee of both Houses. The course proposed would, in my opinion, be favourable to the passing of the Bill; for if it is agreed to by a Joint Committee, in all probability there would be no difficulty in passing it through both Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02021"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having put down several Amendments to this Bill, I should like to say that I have no objection to the course proposed by the noble Viscount, provided that I have not to serve on the Joint Committee. But I take this opportunity of stating that the Amendments which stand in my name were not put down with any hostile intention, and that I have no hostile feeling whatever against the principle of the Bill. I say this because I should not like the impression to be conveyed by the Motion of the noble Viscount that this House is in any way hostile to the principle of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02022"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not intrude when this Bill was read a second time, although considerable reference was made by the noble Lord in charge of the Bill to a judgment that I had given in an important case&#x2014;the case of the Duke of Sutherland&#x2014;which to a certain extent gave rise to the necessity for this Bill. I think the noble Lord was rather in error in certain references he made to the other decision of Mr. Justice Chitty. But I have only risen to concur in the course suggested&#x2014;namely, that the Bill should be referred to a Joint Committee&#x2014;and to point out that whatever view be adopted with regard to some of these Amendments they will inevitably necessitate consequential Amendments at later stages. Therefore I think it is necessary that there should be expert assistance in dealing with the wording of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I am sure any one of your Lordships who has read the Bill or tried to amend it must be well aware that its drafting is by no means perfect. One thing, at all events, is quite certain&#x2014;that there have been a good many cooks employed on this Bill; and some of those cooks, I would say from the result of their work, were not legal cooks. However that may be, I wish to say that I have no objection whatever to the suggested course with regard to this Bill. In fact I quite agree with those who have spoken, that t he best course is to refer this Bill to a Joint Committee of the two Houses. With regard to the clause which I propose to omit, I mentioned this matter on the Second Reading, and the Lord Chancellor suggested that it would be better to deal with the Scottish law as to rights of way, which is entirely different from the English law, in a separate Bill. That was a hint which I thought a very good one, and perhaps the Joint Committee may see fit to deal with the point in the way the noble and learned Lord suggested. But because noble Lords from Scotland disapprove of dealing with this question as it affects Scotland in a single clause tacked on to a Bill which relates to an entirely different law of rights of way, it must not be supposed that for that reason we are in any way hostile to the object of this Bill; and if we had gone into Committee to-day I should have been able to show that not one of my Amendments was prompted by any desire to wreck the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

The whole House, I am quite satisfied, is desirous of carrying out the principle underlying this Bill. I conceived that all through the Second Reading debate; and I hope that the result of the step which my noble friend Lord Haldane has suggested will be that we shall get an agreed Bill and one which will pass as an agreed Bill through both Houses of Parliament without unnecessary delay. I think that would be a most gratifying course to the noble Lord who

<title>THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02027"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether they are able to state the nature of the compensation which the Baghdad Railway Company is entitled to obtain from the Turkish Government on account of the renunciation of the right to construct the section of the line from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. I put this Question on the Paper in consequence of an answer which I observed was given by Sir Edward Grey in another place on March 23. In reply to a Question with regard to the Baghdad Railway, the Foreign Secretary said&#x2014;
<quote>"An agreement between the Turkish Government and the Begin lad Company on ibis subject was signed on the 21st inst. It provides for the renunciation by the company of the right to build the section of the line from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf, and to construct a port at Basra, in favour of a new Turkish company, on condition that no Power except Turkey shall have a share in. the new company greater than that of the Baghdad Railway Company, and that the latter shall have the right to demand from the new company or from, the Turkish Government compensation on account of the above renunciation. The Baghdad Railway Company are also to construct a port at Alexandretta and to build a branch line from there to Osmanieh on the main line, without a kilometric guarantee."</quote>
I submit that the wording of the answer also implies that some further compensation is contemplated to the Baghdad Railway of which at present we are ignorant. I believe that the Foreign Office is to lay Papers shortly on the subject, and I hope, nevertheless, it may not be the case that the noble Viscount opposite may decline to answer my Question on this ground.<lb/>
I cannot resist taking the opportunity of pointing out what an extraordinarily favourable position is now enjoyed in Asia Minor by the Baghdad Railway
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0565"/>
<col>1079</col>
Company&#x2014;in other words, by the German Government&#x2014;justifying the boast of the official organ of the German Foreign Office that "With pride we are able to look upon a new monument of German work, German application, and the German spirit of enterprise." What is the position? The Baghdad Railway Company have now obtained agreements to construct a railway from Konia to the Gulf, although, as we also know, they have abandoned the right to construct the final section. On the Konia-Bulgurlu section, which only amounts to something like 125 miles in length, the Company, I understand, have made up to now a profit reaching something like &#x00A3;800,000, and that profit could only come out of kilometric guarantees and construction guarantees, because the country which it traverses, as I know from my own experience&#x2014;unless it has considerably changed in the last few years&#x2014;is little better than a howling desert. In addition to that, they have obtained the immensely valuable concession of making the line from Alexandretta to Osmanieh, a concession so valuable that they are not even insisting upon the kilometric guarantee. They have also obtained the right virtually to turn Alexandretta into a German port; and that, I may point out, may have the effect of entirely altering the commercial future of the railway. I would also point out that under the terms of this new agreement there is no prospect of the Turkish Government ever recovering possession of the Port of Alexandretta, because they will be precluded from doing so unless they acquire at the same time the Taurus section, which as everybody knows is an extremely unprofitable one and would cost an enormous amount of money to make. In addition to that they have, so far as we know, come to an arrangement with the Russian Government by which German trade is going to find its way into Persia viii Khanikin to the prejudice of this country.<lb/>
What, I would like to ask, does this so-called renunciation amount to? They apparently are making a great parade of having renounced the final section from Baghdad to the Gulf. All who have expressed an opinion on this subject are united in the view that in no circumstances is this particular section likely to be of any commercial value whatever. It may have a considerable amount of political value, but it has no commercial value whatsoever.
<col>1080</col>
Where, therefore, does the question of renunciation come in? If they were renouncing something that was going to be commercially profitable, they would clearly be entitled to compensation; but as there is no question of deriving any advantage from this section, commercially or economically, there does not seem any obvious reason why any compensation should be awarded.<lb/>
This so-called renunciation merely amounts to this, that it is practically a stipulation that no country with the exception of Turkey is to hold a larger share in the undertaking than the Baghdad Railway Company, or, in other words, the German Government. I understand that the proposal is that the shares should be apportioned as follow:&#x2014;The Turkish Government, 40 per cent.; Germany, 20 per cent.; France, 20 per cent.; and ourselves, 20 per cent. Everybody knows that such commerce as there is in those parts is entirely our own. We are infinitely more affected than anybody else, and it appears to me on the face of it that our interests are not safeguarded by the share of 20 per cent., which will enable us to be outvoted whenever it is necessary to do so. In these circumstances I venture to express the opinion that I am entitled to ask the Question standing in my name, and I hope the noble Viscount will be able to give us a reassuring answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02028"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not at all complain of the noble Lord for drawing the attention of the House to this most important topic. He has made a number of very interesting observations, but he has left out of account, if he will allow me to say so, the cardinal fact that this is Turkish territory, that the Turkish Government is a sovereign Government, and that they may make arrangements with the German concessionaires or others&#x2014;subject, of course, to diplomatic action on our part or on the part of France or any other Power&#x2014;to make whatever arrangements may seem to them to be to their general advantage or to the advantage of European or Eastern trade. The noble Lord, I think, overlooks, or dangerously minimises, the fact that the Turkish Government is really the master of its own territory. We had an interesting debate on this matter on the occasion of Lord Curzon's Motion
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0566"/>
<col>1081</col>
about a fortnight ago, and it was then my duty to inform the House of the position in which the various issues concerned stood at that moment. Since then negotiations have been proceeding between Turkey and the concessionaires.<lb/>
As to compensation, the nature of the compensation would naturally be the subject of agreement&#x2014;not between us and the German concessionaires, but between the German Company and the Ottoman Government. It appears to be taken for granted by the noble Lord also that the construction of the section of the railway between Konia and Baghdad is likely, according to expert opinion, partly for the reasons that the noble Lord has indicated, to cost proportionately more than the section between Baghdad and the Gulf. The Baghdad Railway Company, as I understand, have therefore reserved the right to claim, either from the Ottoman Government or from the new company which, as the noble Lord is aware, the Ottoman Government is about to form to construct and work the section between Baghdad and the Gulf, the right to pecuniary compensation for their renunciation of their conceded rights over this particular section. I do not think&#x2014;and the noble Lord, if he thinks about it, will agree&#x2014;that anything is to be gained by further discussion at this, we might almost call it the initial, stage of the discussions between the Ottoman Government and the Baghdad Railway Company, on the one hand, and between the Ottoman Government and His Majesty's Government on the other hand. Very important steps are being taken in the way of discussion, but at this stage, things being what they are in both these aspects, I am afraid I can only say that nothing would be gained by any further discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02029"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships have listened with interest to the further contribution which the noble Viscount has made to public enlightenment on this difficult subject, but I am not sure that my noble friend will think that he has obtained very much light from the answer. We understand that Papers are to be laid. How soon, may I ask, does the noble Viscount think that Papers will be laid?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0007P0-02031"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: That may mean a great deal or not very much. I know they have to be prepared with great care and that a great number of consents have to be obtained, and I do not complain because His Majesty's Government are taking proper time to prepare them. But I was a little surprised by one observation of the noble Viscount. He said that the negotiations were only in their initial stage. I think that any of your Lordships who listened to the debate the other night would have thought, from the attitude the Government took up then, that they were very near absolute completion. I am rather glad to hear that they have only reached the initial stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02032"><member>VISCOUNT MORLE Y OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I was very careful to use the words "hopeful and of good promise," which are words characteristic of an initial stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02033"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I should have hoped that they were characteristic of all stages of a negotiation. I do not in the least quarrel with the noble Viscount, and I was not trying for a moment to convict him of inconsistency. He was speaking with a great sense of responsibility on both occasions, and from the necessarily not very precise language he was able to use I gathered a wrong impression; but I thought, and I believe a great number of your Lordships thought, that matters had reached a very forward position. I am glad to hear that the negotiations are only in their initial stage, for I am bound to say that my impression has been that on this particular matter the British Government is not going to make a specially good bargain. I may be right, or I may be wrong, but I should be glad if His Majesty's Government would realise that if they make what is not a very good bargain that bargain will be subject to a great deal of criticism hereafter.<lb/>
It appears to me that His Majesty's Government are not going to make a very good bargain because I gathered from the speech of the noble Viscount ten days ago that the effect of the new arrangement is that over the greater part of what is known as the Baghdad Railway the British Government will occupy a very inferior position, if, indeed, it occupies any position at all. As regards the Gulf section, the last section of the line to which my noble friend Lord Newton referred, although the British
<image src="S5LV0007P0I0567"/>
<col>1083</col>
Government will occupy a definite position, it will still be an inferior position. Considering the history of this subject, and the great part which Great Britain has played in the affairs of Turkey and in the solution of these different points of policy, it is a matter of some surprise that we should occupy so inferior a position as the result of this bargain. I do not grudge Germany her success. I think it is very important that every country should have an opportunity of furthering its own interests and its own objects of policy. It is important for Germany to have such an opportunity, for I cannot help thinking that the German Government think they have not been well used in the past, and that by the fortunes of diplomacy they have not had such fine opportunties as other countries have had. If the result of the policy of His Majesty's Government is to remove that feeling, it may be of great public advantage. But as to how that matter may stand we must reserve judgment until we see the Papers. From the hint which had been given we were under the impression that we were not going to make, so far as this country is concerned, a good bargain; but if the matter is still in the initial stage there may be an opportunity of revising it a little in our favour.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said, in answer to my noble friend Lord Newton, that he (Lord Newton) seemed to forget that this territory belonged to Turkey, and that Turkey is a sovereign Power and has control over her own territories. That is, of course, a perfectly true observation up to a certain point. Everybody knows, however, that owing to her financial circumstances Turkey is not entirely mistress in her own house, and has not been mistress in her own house ever since any of us can remember. She has, owing to misfortune or misgovernment, or both, lost complete control of her own affairs. She has lost it because she has been bankrupt, and therefore has been unable to pay her way. Consequently, all the great Powers in Europe have, and ought to have, a certain control over her policy, and that control takes the form of a power to prevent her raising her Customs Duties&#x2014;that is to say, to prevent her having complete control over her own revenue and the method of raising it. It is all very well to say that the territory belongs to Turkey, but the financial control of Turkey is not her own but is largely vested in the Powers; and I submit that we are bound to use the power we possess;
<col>1084</col>
and that it is not an answer to a question whether British interests are safeguarded to tell us that this is Turkish territory and that Turkey is an independent sovereign State. I will not say more, except express my sorrow on behalf of my noble friend that he has not been able to obtain more clear information from His Majesty's Government. We shall await the promised Papers with interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0007P0-02034"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, unless I misunderstood the noble Viscount, the Baghdad Railway Company, otherwise the German Government, are going to obtain, in addition to other advantages, pecuniary compensation for not making a line which under no circumstances would be commercially popular. That may be an instance of the extremely practical nature of German diplomacy, but I do not think it redounds greatly to its morality, and I cannot conceive the British Government being successful in a similar attempt.</membercontribution></p>
